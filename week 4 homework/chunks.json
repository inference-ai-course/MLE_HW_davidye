In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagno- sis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field. 1. Introduction Shoulder disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society. The elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder-based tasks, and those with prolonged sedentary desk- bound occupations constitute high-risk cohorts. According to a study by Walker-Bone K et al. (Walker-Bone et al., 2004), the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in the upper limbs among the general population is 52%, with shoulder pain accounting for a significant proportion. Windt \u2020Corresponding authors: Jiankai Sun (jiankai.jksun@bytedance.com), Jindong Hong (hongjindong@pku.edu.cn) arXiv:2510.09230v1 [cs.CV] 10 Oct 2025 DA et al. (Van der Windt et al., 1996) pointed out that the annual incidence rate of shoulder diseases in general practice is approximately 14.7%, which severely affects the quality of life of patients. Periarthritis of the shoulder, a prevalent condition characterized by pain, usually affects individuals in their fifties. In areas with limited medical resources, timely diagnosis of shoulder disorders is often lacking. Early detection is essential to prevent disease progression, reduce patient suffering, and lower treatment time and costs. Certain shoulder disorders, such as periarthritis of the shoulder, can be detected and assessed by analyzing human movement, eliminating the need for costly imaging techniques. However, research in this area remains limited.

However, research in this area remains limited. Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly gained prominence in recent years, driven by a steady stream of diverse foundational models (Qiu et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2025; Firoozi et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025b,a; Ren et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024a). Not only do commercial LLMs exhibit outstanding performance, but a multitude of open-source models have also achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) level (Grattafiori et al., 2024). In traditional prediction and classification tasks, supervised or unsupervised learning is the conventional approach. However, these machine learning paradigms generally require large amounts of data and rely on data scientists or algorithm engineers for model training (Roh et al., 2019). Given the inherent prior knowledge within LLMs, in numerous scenarios, it is not imperative to initiate LLM training from scratch. Consequently, across all industries, there is an ongoing exploration of lightweight methodologies such as prompt engineering (Wei et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022; Lo et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2023), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2024; Lo et al., 2025), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to integrate LLMs into their respective domains, thereby fully capitalizing on the value of foundational LLMs in healthcare and medicine (Qiu et al., 2023, 2025). This paper aims to explore a low-cost approach by leveraging prompt engineering to use MLLMs for the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders. As Figure 1a shows, we investigate whether current MLLMs, after undergoing low-cost prompt-tuning, are capable of directly con- ducting the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders for subjects. This study also provides an affordable preliminary diagnostic solution for regions with limited medical resources. Tradi- tionally, disease diagnosis requires patients to visit hospitals, where doctors rely on observation, inquiry, and imaging using specialized equipment to make a final diagnosis. Leveraging the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs, we aim to facilitate early detection of shoulder disorders by analyzing the range of motion in videos recorded with consumer-grade devices. This approach streamlines the diagnostic process and improves the overall medical experience. In the future, advances in technology may enable this method to be adapted to monitor daily health in home environments, supporting long-term health tracking and timely interventions. 2. Background and Related Works While recent research has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in orthopedic diagnosis, spanning motion analysis to medical report interpretation, barriers remain in terms of accessibility and affordability. Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2024) proposed a real-time motion evaluation system that combines MediaPipe with an improved YOLOv5 model enhanced by a Convolutional Block Attention Module, enabling more accurate detection of spinal disorders and frozen shoulder. To support rapid data processing, they adopted a client-server (C/S) architecture and developed a rehabilitation game, \u201cPicking Bayberries,\u201d to assist", "a real-time motion evaluation system that combines MediaPipe with an improved YOLOv5 model enhanced by a Convolutional Block Attention Module, enabling more accurate detection of spinal disorders and frozen shoulder.

In the traditional diagnostic process, patients must visit a hospital to determine their health status. In contrast, our envisioned AI-powered diagnostic process enables patients to assess their condition remotely using our Video Diagnosis AI Assistant, without the need to visit a hospital. This greatly reduces patient wait times and alleviates the burden on healthcare systems. On the right, we illustrate an application scenario of our framework: a patient performs specific movements, and our model analyzes the motion video to provide a diagnosis.

Our data processing pipeline is designed with both personal privacy protection and engineering optimization in mind for handling human motion video data. 3 deployment in environments without adequate AI expertise or infrastructure. In another line of work, Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2023) proposed an intelligent clustering algorithm based on mus- culoskeletal ultrasound parameters, which, combined with deep learning, enabled automatic grading of shoulder periarthritis pain. This approach provides a low-cost and non-invasive diagnostic alternative, especially for patients who cannot undergo MRI (e.g., those with metal implants), though it still relies on specialized Doppler ultrasound equipment. Vaid et al. (Vaid et al., 2023) fine-tuned a large language model (LLaMA-7B) to extract musculoskeletal pain fea- tures from unstructured clinical notes, achieving superior performance in pain localization (e.g., shoulder, lower back) and acuity classification compared to traditional NLP methods. While the study highlights the potential of LLMs in medical applications, it is primarily intended for use within medical institutions and is not readily accessible to consumers. Previous research has also explored the use of multimodal image and report data in this field. For example, Jin et al. (Jin and Zhang, 2024) introduced the OrthoDoc model, specifically designed for the auxiliary diagnosis of Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Their results demonstrated that OrthoDoc achieved over 91% diagnostic accuracy for common conditions, such as fractures and arthritis, outperforming both open-source and commercial models. While this study highlights the value of multimodal learning", "Zhang, 2024) introduced the OrthoDoc model, specifically designed for the auxiliary diagnosis of Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Their results demonstrated that OrthoDoc achieved over 91% diagnostic accuracy for common conditions, such as fractures and arthritis, outperforming both open-source and commercial models. While this study highlights the value of multimodal learning models (MLLMs) in orthopedics, it remains limited to CT data and does not incorporate dynamic motion analysis, which could be crucial for more comprehensive assessments. Similarly, Truhn et al. (Truhn et al., 2023) conducted a retrospective analysis of GPT-4\u2019s potential in providing treatment recommendations for knee and shoulder conditions, using 20 anonymized MRI reports. Although their results showcase GPT-4\u2019s effectiveness, the study is constrained by its reliance on MRI data and simplistic prompts, making it less applicable in resource-limited settings where such diagnostic tools may not be readily available. In the accurate diagnostic process of diseases, imaging report and data such as those from ultrasound, CT, or MRI remain indispensable and crucial evidence. However, considering that these professional examinations are often accompanied by high costs and resource limitations, this study aims to explore an innovative method that is cost-effective and widely accessible. Our goal is to harness video data from consumer-grade devices, such as smartphones and home cameras, to enable the diagnosis of shoulder disorders using MLLMs. This not only has the potential to lower the cost of medical services but can also significantly enhance the accessibility of preliminary disease screening services. In this research, we explore the feasibility of the direct application of MLLM in the field of the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first work using videos captured by low-cost pervasive consumer-level cameras and MLLMs to diagnose shoulder disorders. Our contributions are threefold: \u2022 In the diagnostic framework, aiming at the problem of information loss in the direct judg- ment made by MLLMs, we have innovatively proposed Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis (HMVDx) and found an extremely low-cost implementation method. This method allows the MLLM to be responsible for converting video information into action description texts, and a reasoning large language model makes a judgment based on these descriptions and pre-set diagnostic rules. This division of labor reduces the complexity of the model\u2019s tasks and improves the accuracy and reliability of diagnosis. Experiments show that this method has clear advantages when dealing with the data of patients with shoulder disorders. \u2022 For diseases that can be preliminarily diagnosed by observing the range of body move- ments, we propose a Motion Trajectories Prompt Framework. This enables LLMs to achieve understanding of human actions, which helps in making more accurate judgments subsequently. This framework utilizes Gemini-1.5-Pro to analyze orthopedic popular 4 science videos, summarize the judgment actions and standards, and replace numerical quantification descriptions with relative position descriptions to improve accuracy. In the future, the framework can help medical practitioners transform general LLMs into specific ones at a low cost. \u2022 In view of the limitations of traditional evaluation indicators when MLLMs in the field of orthopedics are used for the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, we", "descriptions to improve accuracy. In the future, the framework can help medical practitioners transform general LLMs into specific ones at a low cost. \u2022 In view of the limitations of traditional evaluation indicators when MLLMs in the field of orthopedics are used for the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, we constructed an innovative evaluation system. It integrates traditional metrics with Usability Index, a novel metric proposed in this work that accurately evaluates the model from three dimensions: the integrity of action recognition, the rationality of behavior judgment, and the accuracy of the final judgment. It cooperates with detailed scoring standards to disassemble and analyze the model\u2019s output, and sets up a three-level filtering scenario to strengthen the constraints, and deeply analyzes the model\u2019s capabilities. This system provides a scientific and comprehensive tool for analyzing the applicability of MLLMs in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, complementing the traditional metrics. 66.2% 33.8% With Disease Without Disease (a) Disease Distribution 10.1% 36.4% 32.7% 20.8% 30 40 40 50 50 60 60+ (b) Age Distribution 43.6% 56.4% Male Female (c) Gender Distribution Figure 2 | Pie charts illustrating the distribution of disease status, age groups, and gender in our dataset. 3. Results In this study, we use videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the input of MLLMs, and apply them to the preliminary determination and identification of shoulder disorders. Therefore, to accurately quantify the performance gain brought by the additional temporal information when upgrading from image to video modality, we selected GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) as a baseline. The process is shown in Figure 3(a). We process the same batch of samples into a certain number of image sequences, which are used as the input of the GPT-4o model for disease diagnosis. Although GPT-4o has strong multimodal understanding capabilities across text, audio, and images, it does not natively support video as a temporally coherent modality. While it is technically possible to input videos to GPT-4o by feeding frames sequentially, this frame- by-frame processing lacks explicit temporal modeling and continuity understanding, which are critical for capturing dynamic movement patterns in diagnostic tasks. In our evaluations, GPT-4o\u2019s performance on such frame-wise video approximations was lower than that of models designed with dedicated video understanding capabilities. This supports our decision to treat GPT-4o as a control to isolate the impact of temporal information. Meanwhile, in the application of MLLMs, we also conduct a comparative study on the diagnostic effects of Gemini- 1.5-Flash and Gemini-1.5-Pro (See Figure 3). The aim is to explore whether there are significant 5 differences in the diagnostic effects on shoulder disorders between the lightweight model and more complex models. By transferring the core knowledge of Gemini-1.5-Pro to a smaller model, Gemini-1.5-Flash achieves a lightweight architecture while maintaining its multimodal capabilities. Its reasoning speed has been significantly improved, and it is also capable of handling the understanding of long videos. Therefore, in result evaluation, we will divide it into two modules. Firstly, we conduct a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the GPT-4o model based on image input, Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx), and the", "has been significantly improved, and it is also capable of handling the understanding of long videos. Therefore, in result evaluation, we will divide it into two modules. Firstly, we conduct a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the GPT-4o model based on image input, Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx), and the HMVDx proposed in this study. The aim is to analyze the incremental information brought by the video modality and the optimization space of HMVDx. Secondly, in DVDx, we compare the performance differences of models with different sizes to determine whether there are significant differences in the cost of the models and the complexity of their architectures for the diagnostic task. 3.1. Quantitative Analysis 3.1.1. Analysis of Comprehensive metrics Under different constraint scenarios, we conducted a systematic analysis of comprehensive evaluation metrics. These metrics cover multiple dimensions, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. We aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of three approaches, including Baseline, Direct Video Diagnosis, and Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis (Figure 3), in diagnosing shoulder disorders. Table 3 presents a full summary of the system\u2019s performance across all evaluation metrics. We designed three scenarios to evaluate the methods, and their performance across these scenarios is shown in Figure 4a and Figure 4b. In Scenario 1, that is, the bottom-line constraint scenario where only the final judgment result is concerned, HMVDx demonstrated excellent performance in this scenario. Its accuracy rate reached 0.88, and the F1 score was 0.90, with the recall rate and precision rate being 0.83 and 0.98, respectively. Specifically, the accuracy rate of HMVDx was 79.6% and 76.0% higher than that of the GPT-4o baseline and Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx) methods respectively, and the F1 score was 136.8% and 119.5% higher respectively. Overall, HMVDx significantly outperforms both GPT-4o and DVDx in terms of diagnostic performance, demonstrating its ability to deliver highly accurate final judgments. From the perspective of medical diagnosis, a high accuracy rate means that this method can correctly diagnose a high proportion of cases in a large number of samples, and a high F1 score comprehensively reflects a balance between precision and recall, indicating that HMVDx performs excellently both in identifying positive cases and avoiding misdiagnoses. In contrast, the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx performed poorly in this scenario. Scenario 2 is the logical constraint scenario that takes into account both the final judgment and the rationality of the behavior judgment, HMVDx still significantly outperformed the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx in various metrics. Especially in terms of the F1 score, the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx had a substantial decline, indicating that these two models are infeasible under the constraint of logical consistency. The F1 score of HMVDx was approximately 4.7 and 2.8 times higher than that of the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx, reaching 0.68. Generally, an F1 score of around 0.7 is considered a good result. Scenario 3, as the most stringent whole-process constraint scenario, comprehensively con- siders the integrity of action recognition, the rationality of behavior judgment, and the final judgment. In this scenario, although HMVDx was still superior to the GPT-4o", "0.68. Generally, an F1 score of around 0.7 is considered a good result. Scenario 3, as the most stringent whole-process constraint scenario, comprehensively con- siders the integrity of action recognition, the rationality of behavior judgment, and the final judgment. In this scenario, although HMVDx was still superior to the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx, the comprehensive indicators were not satisfactory. Taking the F1 score as an example, that of HMVDx was only 0.19. The low F1 score of HMVDx in Scenario 3 indicates that under the strict requirements of the whole process, the model also has deficiencies. It is worth noting 6 (a) The Framework of Baseline Method.

System Prompt Figure 3 | Overview of Framework Variants for Video Diagnosis 7 that after analyzing the reasons for the bad cases of HMVDx, it was found that the main reason was that the MLLMs for visual understanding in the first step had biases or omissions in the description of human actions. In Scenario 3, the performance of the GPT-4o baseline was signifi- cantly lower than that of DVDx, indicating that for the task of identifying and judging human actions by MLLMs, the modal change from images to videos still brings valuable incremental information. As Figure 4c and Figure 4d shows, by comparing the performance of Direct Video Diagnosis based on models of different sizes, we found that both the F1 score and accuracy of Gemini- 1.5-Flash are lower than those of Gemini-1.5-Pro. Especially in Scenario 1, the accuracy and F1 score of Gemini-1.5-Pro are 31.58% and 173.33% higher than those of the lightweight model. Therefore, in", "Video Diagnosis based on models of different sizes, we found that both the F1 score and accuracy of Gemini- 1.5-Flash are lower than those of Gemini-1.5-Pro. Especially in Scenario 1, the accuracy and F1 score of Gemini-1.5-Pro are 31.58% and 173.33% higher than those of the lightweight model. Therefore, in the comparison of the diagnostic effects of models on shoulder disorders, we found that more complex models with larger parameters have advantages. Considering the performance of different scenarios and models comprehensively, HMVDx outperforms the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx in all scenarios, demonstrating certain advantages. However, the performance of HMVDx drops in Scenario 3, which means that this method cannot provide reliable judgment results when facing the strict constraint of the whole process. Scenario 3 is the closest to a realistic medical scenario, covering a series of key processes such as recognition, judgment, and summarization. If Scenario 3 is taken as the standard, the current three methods cannot meet the requirements of the real medical scenario and are difficult to implement in the actual medical environment. This is because in actual medical scenarios, the reliability of the diagnostic results is of crucial importance, and any mistake in any stage may have a serious impact on the patient\u2019s health. Nevertheless, we still emphasize the huge potential of HMVDx. In Scenario 2, on the premise that all judgments are reasonable, the F1 score of HMVDx still reaches 0.68. Considering the difficulty of judging shoulder disorders, this is a fairly decent level, indicating that HMVDx can achieve a good balance between precision and recall when meeting certain requirements of logical rationality, and has potential to be applied in the field of preliminary judgment of shoulder disorders. The reason is that HMVDx divides recognition and diagnosis into two tasks, fully leveraging individual advantages of the MLLM and the reasoning model. Gemini-1.5-Pro focuses on the description of human actions, while the DeepSeek-R1 can more effectively make reasonable judgments on action descriptions, thus achieving better results. It is worth noting that none of the three methods employed advanced supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or other fine- tuning techniques; instead, they relied solely on the inherent capabilities of the MLLMs. This means that if more advanced optimization technologies are introduced in the future, HMVDx is expected to further improve its performance in the whole-process constraint scenario, thus getting closer to the requirements of actual medical applications. 3.1.2. Analysis of Usability Index Due to the definition of the Usability Index (UI), its values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model usability. As shown in Figure 4e, 4f and Table 1, the overall performance of the GPT-4o model is relatively poor, achieving a UI of only 0.48. This underperformance can be attributed to GPT-4o\u2019s exclusive reliance on image inputs, which severely limits its ability to understand motion and interpret actions effectively. In contrast, the HMVDx model demonstrates strong performance, with a UI of 0.81, substantially higher than that of DVDx (0.53), indicating a clear advantage in overall usability. Further analysis by sample type reveals that for positive cases (i.e., patients", "severely limits its ability to understand motion and interpret actions effectively. In contrast, the HMVDx model demonstrates strong performance, with a UI of 0.81, substantially higher than that of DVDx (0.53), indicating a clear advantage in overall usability. Further analysis by sample type reveals that for positive cases (i.e., patients with shoulder joint disorders), HMVDx achieves a UI of 0.75, far outperforming the GPT-4o baseline (0.28) and DVDx (0.33).

For negative cases (i.e., healthy users), HMVDx attains a UI of 0.92, which is comparable to DVDx and slightly higher than GPT-4o\u2019s 0.86. This indicates that for non-injured individuals, the performance gap among the three methods is relatively minor. By comparing the performance of DVDx based on models of different sizes, we found that the UI of Gemini-1.5-Pro is higher than that of Gemini-1.5-Flash (0.53 versus 0.44), indicating that more complex models still have certain advantages in the tasks of action recognition and judgment. Overall, HMVDx has demonstrated significantly better usability performance than the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx when recognizing shoulder joint injuries. There may be various reasons behind this result. Diagnosing shoulder joint injuries usually involves several key steps, including action recognition, behavior diagnosis, and final judgment. Both the GPT-4o baseline and DVDx use a single MLLM for judgment. This means that the model needs to simultaneously undertake multiple tasks, such as accurately recognizing actions from complex videos, making reasonable behavior diagnoses based on the actions, and providing accurate final judgment results. This task allocation method places extremely high demands on the comprehensive capabilities of the model and increases the likelihood of errors or biases in the", "undertake multiple tasks, such as accurately recognizing actions from complex videos, making reasonable behavior diagnoses based on the actions, and providing accurate final judgment results. This task allocation method places extremely high demands on the comprehensive capabilities of the model and increases the likelihood of errors or biases in the model. In contrast, HMVDx creatively employs two models to work in a division-of-labor and collaborative manner. Gemini-1.5-Pro focuses on providing detailed descriptions of the actions of people in the video, transforming complex video information into an understandable text format. The DeepSeek-R1 model, on the other hand, makes judgments based on these text descriptions. This division-of-labor model effectively reduces the task complexity of each model, enabling each model to exert its maximum effectiveness, thus improving the accuracy and reliability of the entire diagnostic process. 3.2. Qualitative Analysis In the analysis of the experimental results, we found some interesting aspects in MLLM\u2019s understanding of human actions. There may be certain deviations in the description and understanding of free actions. Since we did not constrain the action descriptions generated by the MLLM, the model often produced non-standardized, free-form descriptions that included 10 Table 2 | Summary of grading rubric for model output Label Classification Label Rules Label Definition Integrity of Movement Recognition (A, three-class classification from 0 to 1) 1 = Complete Recogni- tion This method can accurately capture all user actions with clinical indicative signif- icance in the video, such as abduction, for- ward flexion, internal rotation and other standard actions, without any omission. 0.5 = Partial Recogni- tion This method can only capture some of the key actions. 0 = Severe Lack This method completely omits all core ac- tions and fails to effectively recognize the key actions. Rationality of Movement Judgment (R, three-class classification from 0 to 1) 1 = Completely Rational The accurate and reasonable judgments made by this method for each action are highly consistent with the pre-set judg- ment rules, with rigorous and reasonable logic. 0.5 = Partially Rational The judgments of some actions by this method conform to the rules, but in the overall logical deduction process, there may be some non-critical logical leaps or misjudgments. 0 = Completely Irra- tional The judgment of the core actions by this method is contrary to the content of the original video. For example, in the orig- inal video, the patient obviously cannot touch the back with the hand behind, but this method mistakenly describes that the patient can flexibly perform the action of touching the back with the hand behind. Accuracy of Final Judgment (D, binary classification) 1 = Correct Diagnosis The final diagnosis result given by this method is completely consistent with the result after being reviewed by profes- sional doctors in the hospital. 0 = Incorrect Diagnosis It covers the situations of missed diagno- sis (wrongly judging an actually positive case as negative), misdiagnosis (wrongly judging an actually negative case as posi- tive), and the situation where this method cannot give an effective result. 11 compound actions (e.g., circular motions, arm swings). However, As Figure 5 shows, these", "covers the situations of missed diagno- sis (wrongly judging an actually positive case as negative), misdiagnosis (wrongly judging an actually negative case as posi- tive), and the situation where this method cannot give an effective result. 11 compound actions (e.g., circular motions, arm swings). However, As Figure 5 shows, these compound actions are difficult for the reasoning model to decompose into standard evaluative elements (e.g., upward lifting, backward extension), making it challenging to establish effective diagnostic logic. There is also a problem of deviation in judging the starting and ending points during action decomposition. For example, experimental analysis shows that when a target action involves multiple sub-steps (e.g., \"putting hands on the head\" requires first raising the arms and then placing the hands behind the head), the model often struggles to distinguish between the core action and its individual components. This phenomenon is due to unawareness of the action intention during the video understanding process, leading to the model misjudging the process action as the formal action in the clinical action evaluation scenario (such as the arm backward extension test). The recognition of spatial positioning is of crucial significance for judgment. In the model output, we found two types of problems: First, it is challenging to accurately assess limb verticality from a front-facing view. For example, it is difficult to determine whether the arm is fully perpendicular to the ground. In particular, the recognition of the external rotation action and the judgment of its range involve the understanding of spatial depth, causing the performance of MLLMs in this regard is not satisfactory; Second, the recognition rate of the human trunk part is relatively low from the back view (especially the misrecognition rate of the waist area is relatively high). In the optimization of the prompt, for the recognition of the back position, we have improved the recognition accuracy to a certain extent by emphasizing prompts such as paying attention to the waist and hips. Finally, the visual model has a relatively high error rate in judging the left and right directions of the human body. Overall, qualitative results show that HMVDx provides more accurate and interpretable assessments of shoulder joint injuries compared to GPT-4o and DVDx. It better captures complex actions, spatial relationships, and subtle posture variations, making it more reliable for real- world diagnostic use. 4. Discussion In summary, this study explores the application of MLLMs to the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders through the Motion Trajectories Prompt Framework. An innovative HVMDx method has been proposed, and a corresponding evaluation system has been constructed. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of different methods, we have found that HMVDx demonstrates significant advantages in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders. By means of division of labor and cooperation, it reduces the task complexity of a single model and improves the accuracy and reliability of judgment. However, although HMVDx performs out- standingly in terms of performance, all current methods still cannot meet the strict requirements of practical medical applications according to Scenario 3, which is the closest to the real medical scenario.

However, although HMVDx performs out- standingly in terms of performance, all current methods still cannot meet the strict requirements of practical medical applications according to Scenario 3, which is the closest to the real medical scenario. More statistical comparison on research is available in Supplementary Materials. Currently, MLLMs have problems in aspects such as dynamic video analysis, body position- ing accuracy, action decomposition accuracy, and orientation recognition, which indicate the direction of optimization for future research. This study has revealed the potential of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for assisting medical practitioners with diagnosing shoulder disorders. Moreover, it has made contributions in the construction of medical motion prompt framework, diagnostic methods, and improvement of the evaluation metrics when MLLMs are applied to the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders. 12 The user performed an arm raising action in the video.

The left hand exceeded the top of the head, while the right hand showed obvious difficulty in lifting and did not reach the height above the head. Subsequently, both arms were slowly lowered. The user raised both hands upward and slowly holding the head. Among them, the left hand had limited bending angle and was obviously strenuous, after which both arms were lowered. The user first brought both hands behind the back. The right hand touched the back, while the left hand could only reach the buttock. Finally, the user lowered both hands and stood naturally. The user's hands did not exceed the top of the head during the action, and the movement was strenuous.

Our method demonstrates superior performance over GPT-4o and DVDx The core research objective is to verify whether MLLMs have the capability to construct practical preliminary diagnostic tools through low-threshold prompt tuning. Demonstrating the technical feasibility of this approach is crucial to assessing its potential for widespread adoption in primary care settings. Experimental comparisons have found that a series of diseases that can be interpreted based on visual representations (such as the assessment of muscle group status in lumbar muscle strain and the identification of local swelling characteristics in tenosynovitis) will have the opportunity to be transformed into standardized intelligent screening tools. Due to its low dependence on professional annotation data and computing power, this technical path particularly conforms to the core concern of this study regarding the technical scalability. It is expected to alleviate the uneven distribution of primary medical resources by constructing a lightweight diagnostic system and providing scalable technical support for improving the level of group health management. Future research can expand and deepen from multiple dimensions on the basis of this study. Technologies such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI (Qiu et al., 2024a), and knowledge graphs should be actively introduced to further explore the application potential of MLLMs in the medical field. Furthermore, research could be carried out in a multilingual environment to enable the model to adapt to medical data with different languages and broaden the application scope of the research findings. At the data level, more high-quality and diverse medical imaging and video data could be leveraged, covering various demographics, further expanding the scale of the dataset and improving the generalization ability of the model and the accuracy of preliminary diagnosis. 5. Methods 5.1. Real-world Datasets for HVMDx This research was conducted in close collaboration with hospitals and medical institutions, which contributed a rich and targeted dataset of human motion videos for this study. These videos cover the movement of individuals with shoulder disorders, as well as activity videos of healthy people. We applied personal privacy protection and engineering processing to the human motion video data using the pipeline illustrated in Figure 1b. In order to comply with the principles of privacy protection, after obtaining sample videos of human movement, we have taken 13 comprehensive privacy protection measures. For the personal information involved in the videos, including identification information and sensitive privacy content such as medical histories, all have been concealed and eliminated through professional technical means. At the same time, to further safeguard the facial privacy security of the people in the videos, we have employed techniques such as facial masking and blurring to ensure that individual facial features cannot be recognized. During data pre-processing, in order to enable the MLLMs for video understanding to focus more accurately on the understanding of human movements, we eliminated the sound", "the people in the videos, we have employed techniques such as facial masking and blurring to ensure that individual facial features cannot be recognized. During data pre-processing, in order to enable the MLLMs for video understanding to focus more accurately on the understanding of human movements, we eliminated the sound from the video. Meanwhile, we select videos with independent and complete human movements to reduce the impact of irrelevant information on the model\u2019s evaluation. To increase the efficiency of model inference, we cropped videos and compressed their size to make them more flexible. To ensure high-quality annotations, we invited some distinguished medical experts specializ- ing in orthopedics to manually annotate the samples.When assessing the movement around the shoulder joint, the evaluation mainly focuses on aspects such as whether there are limitations in actions like the upward lifting, external rotation and abduction, internal rotation and adduction of the affected upper limb, and whether the range of motion has decreased. Meanwhile, in cases where there is a comparison of bilateral movements, the emphasis is placed on comparing whether the movement performance of the affected side and the healthy side is balanced or shows differences. For example, the upward lifting range of the affected upper limb is signif- icantly smaller compared to that of the healthy side. In addition, the experts will also make annotations for situations in the video samples where it is difficult to make an accurate judgment due to incomplete movements. Here we provide a description of the sample. For instance, a person performed three actions in total: upward lifting, holding the head with both hands, and touching the back with the hands behind the back, which involve functions such as upward lifting, internal rotation, external rotation, adduction, and abduction of the shoulder joint. The upward lifting range of the affected side is obviously smaller than that of the healthy side. The healthy upper limb can be lifted up to 180\u00b0 (perpendicular to the ground), while the upward lifting range of the affected side is approximately between 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 (slightly higher than the horizontal position). When the person performs the action of holding the head with the affected upper limb, the height is relatively low, and when performing the action of touching the back with the hands behind the back, the affected upper limb can only be lifted to the height of the buttocks, indicating that the functions of abduction and external rotation (holding the head with both hands) and internal rotation and adduction (touching the back with the hands behind the back) are limited. It can be inferred that the patient has a unilateral shoulder joint disorder. Based on the above criteria, we have sought to obtain the maximum number of samples possible. The final sample dataset consists of a total of 761 sample videos. After being labeled by doctors, 504 samples are highly likely to indicate shoulder disorders, while 257 samples are highly likely to have no shoulder disorders. The distributions of disease status, age groups, and gender within our dataset are presented in Figure 2. 5.2. HMVDx In", "total of 761 sample videos. After being labeled by doctors, 504 samples are highly likely to indicate shoulder disorders, while 257 samples are highly likely to have no shoulder disorders. The distributions of disease status, age groups, and gender within our dataset are presented in Figure 2. 5.2. HMVDx In a real diagnostic environment, doctors establish a basic understanding of the patient\u2019s movement by observing the patient\u2019s limb activities, and then make a judgment based on medical knowledge as to whether there may be abnormal diseases. Therefore, we simulate this process and propose a Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx) method and Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis (HMVDx) based on motion understanding and disease diagnosis. Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx) involves inputting video samples into a MLLM and then 14 directly obtaining the diagnostic results. Specifically, the operation is as follows: as Figure 3 shows, first, the system prompt is finely tuned, and then the video samples are input into the MLLM, expecting the model to output diagnostic results based on the understanding of the video. We employ Gemini-1.5-Pro as the core model for direct video diagnosis, as it supports long-context understanding and exhibits strong reasoning capabilities in complex video tasks (Team et al., 2024). It can effectively integrate video, audio, and text features. In the EgoSchema task (Mangalam et al., 2023), Gemini-1.5-Pro achieved an accuracy rate of 70.2% using only 16 frames, setting a new SOTA performance (in comparison, the accuracy rate of GPT-4V is 55.6%). Meanwhile, in applications within the medical field, Gemini-1.5-Pro also performs outstandingly in the understanding of medical images and the analysis of surgical videos. Gemini 1.5 Pro has developed a medical-specific LLM, Med-Gemini-M 1.5 (Saab et al., 2024). This model has been validated in the automated report generation for chest X-rays and CT scans, and some of the results have been rated as \"clinically acceptable\" by medical experts. In the Direct Video Diagnosis (DVDx) implementation, the system prompt is first provided (details on how it is generated will be discussed later), followed by the user\u2019s behavior video as the user prompt. Finally, the model outputs the result. DVDx requires that MLLM has a powerful video understanding ability, that is, it can \"translate\" the video content into an understanding of actions and behaviors, and make judgments based on the content understood visually. However, the entire task actually requires MLLM to go through two understanding processes, which is highly likely to lead to the loss or omission of information. Therefore, we innovatively propose HMVDx based on motion understanding and disease diagnosis. This method realizes the process of the MLLM\u2019s understanding of the video and the diagnostic process through two models connected in series. For these two models, we conduct fine-tuning of the prompts respectively to achieve their corresponding functions. HMVDx is developed as a collaborative diagnostic framework based on Gemini-1.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1, decoupling video description and behavior judgment through the concatenation of multiple models. The role of the Gemini-1.5-Pro model is not to directly produce diagnostic results, but rather to generate detailed descriptions of the movements of individuals in the video. In", "as a collaborative diagnostic framework based on Gemini-1.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1, decoupling video description and behavior judgment through the concatenation of multiple models. The role of the Gemini-1.5-Pro model is not to directly produce diagnostic results, but rather to generate detailed descriptions of the movements of individuals in the video. In the diagnostic phase, we employ DeepSeek-R1 as the diagnostic model due to its strong reasoning capabilities (Guo et al., 2025). Compared to models like GPT-4o, reasoning- oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1 have the advantage of enabling deeper thinking and more advanced reasoning. In addition, as an open-source model, DeepSeek-R1 has a high degree of transparency and lower application costs. In our specific implementation, by leveraging the video understanding ability of Gemini-1.5-Pro, a prompt strategy such as \"Please describe the action sequence of the patient in the video using sports medicine terms\" is inputted along with the video sample, and the action description is obtained. Taking the action description generated by Gemini-1.5-Pro as the input, DeepSeek-R1 makes judgments by understanding and comparing the description of the human actions with the established rules. Finally, the DeepSeek-R1 model outputs the final diagnostic result. 5.3. Motion Trajectories Prompt Framework The diagnostic prompt is a crucial factor influencing the diagnostic performance of the model (Liu et al., 2023). In order to enable the model to fully understand the task requirements, we proposed Motion Trajectories Prompt Framework. In common orthopedic diseases and some neurological diseases, the range of limb movement of patients serves as an important basis for doctors\u2019 judgment and understanding of the diseases. During the generation and optimization of the prompts, we propose to use the results of the video understanding by the MLLM as the founda- tion. At the same time, we replace numerical quantification descriptions with relative position 15 descriptions to improve accuracy, enabling the model to fully understand the situation of human activities and laying the foundation for relevant examinations regarding the trajectory of human movements and the range of limb movements. 5.4. Video Understanding-diagnosis Prompt (Prompt-A) In the structure of the prompt, we clearly define the role of the model as that of an orthopedic expert to avoid common-sense misjudgments. In the diagnostic thinking path, we guide the model to use the Chain of Thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) method to construct a complete path from action recognition, action judgment to the final result. This conforms to the requirements of the real diagnostic process and ensures the medical compliance of the reasoning path. Instead of directly using formal medical diagnostic rules, we curated science videos created by doctors from public websites and input them into Gemini-1.5-Pro to generate diagnostic prompts. MLLMs summarized the core actions and diagnostic criteria. We also precisely defined the role of the MLLM in the prompt and elaborated on the requirements during the identification process, such as person confirmation, noise reduction processing, etc. In diagnostic rules, we found that directly using numerical quantitative descriptions (such as \"flex the elbow at 30 degrees\") would lead to an increase in the misjudgment rate of the", "in the prompt and elaborated on the requirements during the identification process, such as person confirmation, noise reduction processing, etc. In diagnostic rules, we found that directly using numerical quantitative descriptions (such as \"flex the elbow at 30 degrees\") would lead to an increase in the misjudgment rate of the model. Through the analysis of the model mechanism, we discovered that the next token prediction mechanism of MLLMs has inherent limitations in understanding the absolute values. Therefore, we switched to using relative position descriptions, such as \"higher than the top of the head\", etc. In the judgment part about the disease, we constructed a three-dimensional space detection matrix, covering the key movement planes of the shoulder joint. In some detailed designs, the defensive design requires secondary verification for some boundary issues. For example, for key actions (such as touching the back with the hands behind the back), cross-validation prompts are set to prevent single judgment errors; the visual analysis guidance establishes the requirement of \"watching frame by frame\", making the model establish the awareness of action trajectory tracking. Finally, we invited medical experts to conduct a secondary confirmation of the action descriptions to ensure that these action descriptions are feasible for the diagnosis and discrimination of shoulder disorders. We took this part of the diagnostic rules as the core component of the prompt. 5.5. Movement-understanding Prompt (Prompt-B) The awareness of the human movement in the video is of vital importance for diagnosis. In this prompt, we established five recognition dimensions, namely movement recognition \u2192 spatial trajectory \u2192symmetry comparison \u2192compensation feature \u2192smoothness, which form a complete closed loop for motion analysis. At the same time, in order to match the diagnostic rules in Prompt-A, which mainly focuses on relative positions, we use a dynamic reference system as well for position description: taking bony landmarks such as the earlobe, acromion, and iliac crest as reference points. This helps the model develop a cognitive understanding of the spatial characteristics of limb movements. For example, interpreting \"the height of touching the back reaches the waist\" as indicating a lower-than-normal range of motion suggests movement limitation. In addition, for abnormal signals\u2014such as compensatory behaviors like shoulder shrugging\u2014we further enhance the model\u2019s ability to recognize and reason about these patterns. 16 5.6. Text-judgment Prompt (Prompt-C) To align the diagnostic criteria of the two methods, the diagnostic rules in the prompt-C of HMVDx are kept consistent with those in the Direct Video Diagnosis\u2019 prompt (prompt - A). Based on the characteristics of the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model, we guide the model to summarize rule-based movements from the action descriptions, and then judge the possibility of diseases according to the specific performance of movement completion. Meanwhile, we emphasize that identifying potential movement limitations through abnormal signs, such as shoulder shrugging or trembling, is also considered a critical component of the diagnostic process. 5.7. Evaluation Framework Most evaluation metrics in classification are binary ones. They can only enable us to know the final output of the model, but fail to reveal the intermediate output results during the method\u2019s execution process. This issue", "trembling, is also considered a critical component of the diagnostic process. 5.7. Evaluation Framework Most evaluation metrics in classification are binary ones. They can only enable us to know the final output of the model, but fail to reveal the intermediate output results during the method\u2019s execution process. This issue is particularly prominent when MLLMs are applied to the diagnosis of shoulder disorders. In the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, although the final outcome is a binary classification, the reasoning process behind the diagnosis is critically important. To comprehensively evaluate the method, we aim to establish an indicator system that assesses not only the final decision, but also the underlying diagnostic rationale and process. To this end, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes standard performance metrics\u2014such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score\u2014under various constraints. Additionally, we introduce the Usability Index to further assess the practical applicability of the method. 5.7.1. Comprehensive metrics Accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score are common evaluation metrics for classification models. Recall represents the proportion of actual positive samples that are correctly predicted as positive by the model. Precision refers to the proportion of samples that are actually positive among those predicted as positive by the model. The F1 value is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines precision and recall and can more comprehensively evaluate the performance of the model. However, it should be noted that in the scenario of judgment of shoulder disorders, tra- ditional classification metrics (such as the F1 value) have limitations. Existing classification metrics only focus on the final judgment and ignore the rationality of the diagnostic path. For example, the model may draw a correct conclusion through incorrect action recognition (such as misjudging \"limited forward flexion\" as \"normal external rotation\"). This situation of \"correct result but wrong process\" poses a high risk in the medical scenario. The rationality and correct- ness of the medical diagnosis process are equally crucial. An incorrect diagnostic path may lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, which will have a serious impact on the patient\u2019s health. According to the real diagnostic process, doctors need to first identify the patient\u2019s actions, then determine whether there are limitations in the actions, and finally draw a conclusion. Therefore, we also incorporate the above judgments into the evaluation indicators, which are divided into whether the action recognition is complete, whether the action judgment is accurate, and whether the final judgment result is correct. In this research, since the logical consistency of multiple steps is also one of the key aspects of the model\u2019s performance that we focus on, when analyzing the classification results output by the model, we have designed a three-level filtering scenario. By gradually strengthening 17 the constraint conditions, we redefine and label the model\u2019s output results under different conditions, and quantitatively evaluate the true capabilities of the MLLM method. Scenario 1: Bottom-line Constraint (Focusing only on the final judgment result) In this scenario, the evaluation focuses on the final judgment prediction of the MLLM. That is, the final judgment given by the model is", "output results under different conditions, and quantitatively evaluate the true capabilities of the MLLM method. Scenario 1: Bottom-line Constraint (Focusing only on the final judgment result) In this scenario, the evaluation focuses on the final judgment prediction of the MLLM. That is, the final judgment given by the model is regarded as the prediction result, and traditional evaluation indicators such as F1 values are calculated based on this. This scenario aims to quickly obtain the basic performance of the model at the final judgment level, laying a foundation for subsequent in-depth evaluation. Scenario 2: Logical Constraint (Taking into account both the final judgment and the movement judgment) This scenario focuses on the final judgment of the MLLM on the premise that the behavior judgment is completely reasonable. Only when the model\u2019s behavior judgment meets the standard of complete rationality will we accept its final judgment result as the effective prediction of the model. For example, for a positive case of shoulder disorder, if the model\u2019s action diagnosis is only partially reasonable, even if its final diagnosis is that the patient has a shoulder disorder, in the evaluation of this scenario, we will still determine the model\u2019s final prediction result as 0 (because the model fails to make correct judgments in both movement judgment and final judement, so its final result is not credible). Conversely, if the model\u2019s behavior judgment is completely reasonable and the final judgment is that there is a shoulder disorder, then we will determine the model\u2019s final prediction result as 1. By introducing the key constraint of the rationality of behavior judgment, this scenario further refines the evaluation of the performance of MLLM, making the evaluation results more in line with the requirements of logical rationality in medical judgment. Scenario 3: Full-link Constraint (Comprehensively considering the integrity of movement cognition, movement judgment, and the final judgment) This scenario is the most stringent in evaluating the MLLM methods, and it is necessary to comprehensively pay attention to the integrity of movement prediction and the rationality of movement judgment. Only when the model achieves complete integrity in movement recognition and the movement judgment is completely reasonable will we refer to its final judgment result. For example, if the model omits key actions in the action prediction link or there are unreasonable aspects in the movement judgment, even if the final judgment result is correct, it will not be regarded as an effective prediction in this scenario. This scenario simulates the strict requirements for the accuracy of the entire process in medical diagnosis, and can comprehensively and deeply reveal the true capabilities of the MLLM methods in complex medical judgment tasks, providing the most comprehensive and strict standard for the accurate evaluation of the performance of the MLLM methods. 5.8. Usability Index In view of the special requirements for the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, we have constructed a novel three-dimensional Usability Index system, namely the Usability Index (UI). This system breaks through the limitation of traditional evaluation indicators that only focus on the final result, and achieves a comprehensive and whole-process", "In view of the special requirements for the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders, we have constructed a novel three-dimensional Usability Index system, namely the Usability Index (UI). This system breaks through the limitation of traditional evaluation indicators that only focus on the final result, and achieves a comprehensive and whole-process accurate evaluation of the \"judgment path - decision-making logic - result accuracy\". Its calculation formula is: UI = 0.5\u00d7D + 0.3\u00d7R + 0.2\u00d7A. In this formula, D represents the accuracy of the final judgment, R represents 18 the rationality of the movement judgment, and A represents the integrity of the movement recognition. After obtaining the output results of the model for the video samples, the data annotation engineers will carefully break down the conclusions into three sections: movement recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis, and conduct a comparative analysis with the actual videos to carry out a scoring evaluation. The scoring criteria and their corresponding definitions are presented in Table 2. In calculating the Usability Index (UI), we involved experienced clinicians to ensure that the evaluation reflects real-world diagnostic reasoning and clinical decision-making. Specifically, the components of Rationality (R) and Accuracy (A) were assessed based on the clinicians\u2019 professional judgment. For Rationality (R), clinicians were asked to evaluate whether the model\u2019s decision-making process, such as the sequence of observed signs, the use of spatial reasoning, and the handling of abnormal features, aligned with established medical reasoning and clinical heuristics. For Accuracy (A), the clinicians judged whether the final diagnostic conclusion was consistent with the clinical presentation, using the same standards they would apply in practice. To mitigate subjectivity, we adopted a structured scoring rubric (see Table 2) and required that each case be independently evaluated by at least two clinicians. In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached through discussion. This process ensured not only the credibility of the evaluation but also consistency across cases. Involving domain experts in this manner allowed the UI to go beyond conventional metrics (e.g., accuracy or F1 score) and better reflect the method\u2019s practical usability and trustworthiness in clinical scenarios. Regarding the accuracy of the final judgment D, the rationality of the movement diagnosis R, and the integrity of the movement recognition A, based on the importance and criticality of these three steps in the real medical process, and after discussing with medical experts and collecting the suggestions of multiple experts, we assign weights of 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2 to the three indicators respectively. \u2022 0.5\u00d7 Accuracy of the Final Judgment (D): In a medical scenario, \"accurate judgment results\" is the bottom line. Even if there are certain flaws in the judgment process, for example, missing one non-critical action, as long as the final judgment result is correct (D = 1), the output of the model is still feasible. \u2022 0.3\u00d7 Rationality of the Movement Judgment (R): The weight setting of 0.3 is in a reasonable value, which means that the method is allowed to make certain mistakes in the judgment of some actions, but has to be consistent with the final judgment. \u2022 0.2\u00d7 Integrity", "is still feasible. \u2022 0.3\u00d7 Rationality of the Movement Judgment (R): The weight setting of 0.3 is in a reasonable value, which means that the method is allowed to make certain mistakes in the judgment of some actions, but has to be consistent with the final judgment. \u2022 0.2\u00d7 Integrity of the Movement Recognition (A): Actions are the foundation for judgment. Missing the detection of key actions (such as failing to recognize \"abduction\") will lead to the loss of subsequent judgments. The weight of 0.2 neither overly punishes the lack of details (such as missing one non-critical action), nor is it too lenient. 19 Table 3 | Comprehensive Metrics Scenario Framework Metric Mean 95% CI - Lower Bound 95% CI - Upper Bound Scenario 1 Baseline Accuracy 0.489 0.349 0.628 F1-Score 0.384 0.182 0.571 Precision 0.876 0.600 1.000 Recall 0.251 0.103 0.414 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Flash Accuracy 0.381 0.346 0.415 F1-Score 0.151 0.110 0.192 Precision 0.824 0.714 0.929 Recall 0.083 0.059 0.108 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Pro Accuracy 0.496 0.460 0.534 F1-Score 0.409 0.363 0.460 Precision 0.917 0.872 0.957 Recall 0.263 0.227 0.305 Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis Accuracy 0.883 0.858 0.905 F1-Score 0.904 0.883 0.923 Precision 0.988 0.976 0.998 Recall 0.833 0.799 0.864 Scenario 2 Baseline Accuracy 0.370 0.233 0.512 F1-Score 0.120 0.000 0.286 Precision 0.611 0.000 1.000 Recall 0.068 0.000 0.172 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Flash Accuracy 0.362 0.329 0.398 F1-Score 0.133 0.095 0.176 Precision 0.661 0.525 0.786 Recall 0.074 0.052 0.100 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Pro Accuracy 0.381 0.347 0.414 F1-Score 0.177 0.138 0.218 Precision 0.738 0.641 0.836 Recall 0.101 0.077 0.126 Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis Accuracy 0.665 0.632 0.696 F1-Score 0.680 0.641 0.716 Precision 0.926 0.894 0.956 Recall 0.538 0.493 0.581 Scenario 3 Baseline Accuracy 0.023 0.000 0.070 F1-Score 0.045 0.000 0.130 Precision 0.063 0.000 0.214 Recall 0.036 0.000 0.120 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Flash Accuracy 0.175 0.147 0.204 F1-Score 0.090 0.060 0.122 Precision 0.167 0.112 0.224 Recall 0.061 0.040 0.085 Direct Video Diagnosis with Gemini-1.5-Pro Accuracy 0.228 0.197 0.258 F1-Score 0.098 0.069 0.130 Precision 0.218 0.154 0.283 Recall 0.064 0.044 0.085 Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis Accuracy 0.272 0.242 0.306 F1-Score 0.194 0.153 0.237 Precision 0.363 0.291 0.434 Recall 0.133 0.103 0.165 20 References Firoozi, R., Tucker, J., Tian, S., Majumdar, A., Sun, J., Liu, W., Zhu, Y., Song, S., Kapoor, A., Hausman, K., et al.

To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited, and mostly focuses on classifi- cation tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG archi- tectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, \u201c.the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warn- ing messages across 13 different types of cri- sis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civil- ians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis de- scriptions, and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations fol- low expert\u2019s written guidelines to ensure cor- rect terminology and factuality of their sugges- tions. Additionally, each message is accompa- nied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model perfor- mance in out-of-distribution scenarios and eval- uated the effectiveness of an automatic post- editor. 1 Introduction Our world is shaped by rapidly evolving social and environmental phenomena that can profoundly im- pact thousands or even millions.

For each crisis scenario, a description is provided, then a list of events in chrono- logical order describing that situation. For each event 4 different warning messages are provided (one consistent with expert based guidelines about tone and behavioral instructions and three suboptimal versions). even nations (LaFree and Dugan, 2007; World Me- teorological Organization, 2021). Consequently, there has been a growing interest in crisis and emer- gency management, aiming to bridge disciplines and develop practical, actionable solutions to mit- igate risks from events such as tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and violent acts like terrorism (Rosen- thal et al., 2001; Canton, 2019). To tackle these challenges, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly making its way as an ally in assisting humans in crisis management (Comes, 2024; Harika et al., 2024; Hyun-soo and Gyun- yeol, 2020). Still, despite the growing number of AI applications, the use of NLP remains limited, mostly focusing on classification tasks (Alam et al., arXiv:2510.09243v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Scenarios Collection Events Extraction Messages Generation All Tone Inst All Inst & Tone Guidelines Event n ...

Scenarios collection is described in \u00a73, events extraction from scenario description is reported in \u00a73, and the generation of various warning message versions for each event in \u00a73. 2021; Yin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021). How- ever, with the advent of LLMs it is now possible to address other crucial area of crisis management, i.e. how communication should be structured and delivered (White, 2011; Hu and Kapucu, 2016), for example by assisting emergency operators in writing warning messages (Otal et al., 2024). As a step in this direction, we introduce Crisi- Text, the first crisis management dataset designed to specialize LLMs on expert-based crisis communi- cation. In Figure 2, we detail the pipeline employed to develop the dataset. We extracted the scenario descriptions from two existing sources: the FEMA IPAWS Archived Alerts1 and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) (LaFree and Dugan, 2007). These datasets provide detailed descriptions of various natural disasters and terrorist attacks, respectively. Using GPT-4o-mini,2 we first derived, for each de- scription, a sequence of textual events in chronolog- ical order, simulating the unfolding of the scenario. These events are then utilized to generate warning messages aimed at guiding civilians during and after the specific event. We crafted messages ac- cording to two specific dimensions of", "first derived, for each de- scription, a sequence of textual events in chronolog- ical order, simulating the unfolding of the scenario. These events are then utilized to generate warning messages aimed at guiding civilians during and after the specific event. We crafted messages ac- cording to two specific dimensions of expert-based guidelines: (i) Tone and (ii) Instructions. For Tone, the messages must ensure proper terminology, pro- vide accurate information, and avoid causing panic. For Instruction, instead, FEMA\u2019s guidelines are used to provide grounded suggestions on how to behave depending on the type of crisis. Along with the correctly generated warnings, usable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we also produced sub-optimal messages to test preference alignment techniques. These messages may lack lexical cor- rectness, suggestion relevance, or both. Using this approach, we generate over 100,000 warning mes- 1https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/ ipaws-archived-alerts-v1 2specifically, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18. sages, associated with over 300,000 bad counter- parts, covering 13 emergency scenarios. An exam- ple from the dataset is shown in Figure 1. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset for crisis communication, we designed various exper- imental setups. We conducted experiments with Llama 3 models (Dubey et al., 2024), using both SFT and ORPO (Hong et al., 2024), a preference alignment technique. Specifically, we tuned models to perform the tasks of warning message generation and post-editing. Results show a comparable per- formance between ORPO and SFT. Thus, building on the SFT setup, the less computationally demand- ing method, we run further experiments to test the benefits of providing additional context in warn- ing message generation (i.e. specific instruction guidelines and/or previously generated messages). We analyzed the impact of such additional con- text both for already seen and out-of-distribution scenario types. The importance of previous mes- sages is evident for already seen scenario types while instructions guidelines are fundamental for out-of-distribution cases. Finally, using the Bad Messages, we fine-tuned an automatic post-editor model which shows promising results in improving the quality of poorly written warning messages. 2 Related Work How to optimally react to crises and emergencies caused by natural or social phenomena has been widely studied (Quarantelli, 1988; Pearson and Mitroff, 1993; Wex et al., 2014). Research in this field focuses on communication practices (Heath and O\u2019Hair, 2009; Fearn-Banks, 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016), as they are a fundamental compo- nent of the crisis management process. In highly dynamic, stressful, and dangerous scenarios, the ability to communicate swiftly and effectively can significantly reduce risks. In addition to the specific challenges posed by disasters, the rapid evolution of media and commu- nication tools makes information diffusion more complex (Haddow and Haddow, 2022). In fact, modern technologies such as messaging apps and social media raise opportunities as well as risks. On the one hand, they enable instant delivery of rel- evant information to a larger audience, thus increas- ing the likelihood of helping individuals directly involved in such situations. On the other hand, they pose challenges such as information overload (Bawden and Robinson, 2008), which can create ineffective behaviors and confusion, as well as the proliferation of incorrect information or fake news (Hansson et", "larger audience, thus increas- ing the likelihood of helping individuals directly involved in such situations. On the other hand, they pose challenges such as information overload (Bawden and Robinson, 2008), which can create ineffective behaviors and confusion, as well as the proliferation of incorrect information or fake news (Hansson et al., 2020; Gisondi et al., 2022). Within this evolving scenario, AI pipelines are emerging as key tools for managing crises and emergencies, with works exploring domain such as decision-making, mobility studies, and crisis de- tection (Comes, 2024; Hyun-soo and Gyun-yeol, 2020; Harika et al., 2024). This field also explores the use of NLP to ad- dress practical applications. The diffusion of so- cial networks has allowed the creation of datasets from user-generated content during crisis events like floods or tornadoes (Olteanu et al., 2014; Im- ran et al., 2016). Given their tweet-based and hu- man annotations structure, these datasets are mostly used for binary or multi-label classification tasks such as informativeness, crisis detection, or crisis type recognition. These tasks are addressed either by training or fine-tuning deep learning models (Alam et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) or using LLMs for zero-shot classification (Yin et al., 2024). The literature also includes datasets that gathers civilian messages directed to disaster reporting ser- vices (Munro, 2012). This line of research, known as crisis communication, has recently explored the use of LLM-powered systems not only for classify- ing different types of crises but also for enhancing the efficiency of emergency operators by extract- ing the most relevant information from a call and display it to the operator to guide the civilian (Otal et al., 2024). To fill the gap on warning messages generation within the NLP field, we propose a novel crisis com- munication dataset covering 13 different scenario types and following expert written guidelines. 3 CrisiText Dataset Fine-tuning LLMs for crisis communication re- quires warning messages that are linked to a se- quence of chronologically ordered events. To this end, we identified two existing resources suitable for creating a crisis communication dataset. Open- FEMA IPAWS Archived Alerts3 contains warning messages from 2012 to the present issued by over 1,450 alert organizations (mainly for natural disas- ters). It includes details such as date, time, and ge- ographic information from public emergency alerts across the United States, along with scenario de- scriptions. The second dataset is the Global Terror- ism Database (GTD) (LaFree and Dugan, 2007), that focuses on violent attacks providing detailed data on each incident, including date, location, and descriptions. Since these two resources were not designed for NLP applications nor provided the data or struc- ture we required, we used GPT-4o-mini to generate a synthetic dataset based on them. We first se- lected those scenarios in which a large population is threatened and then used GPT-4o-mini to de- rive a list of chronologically ordered events from their descriptions. Then, we prompted the model with guidelines for both effective communication (TONE) and behavioral guidance (INSTRUCTION). We thus obtained expert-level warning messages for each event within a scenario. The following sections will describe in detail", "then used GPT-4o-mini to de- rive a list of chronologically ordered events from their descriptions. Then, we prompted the model with guidelines for both effective communication (TONE) and behavioral guidance (INSTRUCTION). We thus obtained expert-level warning messages for each event within a scenario. The following sections will describe in detail each step in the creation of the dataset. Scenarios Collection. Starting from GTD and OpenFEMA\u2019s archive, we collected textual descrip- tions of violent attacks and natural disasters, re- spectively. To gather these scenarios (textual de- scriptions) we filtered both datasets according to specific labels. For GTD, we collected scenarios where the focus was on group security rather than incidents involving individuals. Then we filtered scenarios whose description was more than 300 characters, resulting in the collection of violent attack, explosion, and arson scenarios. For Open- FEMA we focused on collecting scenarios labeled as urgent and linked to FEMA Instruction pages (e.g. wildfires, floods, hurricanes, thunderstorms, landslides, tsunamis, earthquake). We used up to 2,000 scenarios for each natural disaster type and included all scenarios from GTD. For more details on this step, see Appendix A. 3https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/ ipaws-archived-alerts-v1 Events Extraction. To obtain a chronological list of events occurring in each scenario descrip- tion, we used GPT-4o-mini. In some cases, the descriptions were excessively long (more common in OpenFEMA) or contained unnecessary details (more frequent in GTD). To address these issues in the generation process, OpenFEMA events lists were generated limiting the number of events to maximum 15, while GTD texts underwent an ad- ditional generation step: first descriptions were rewritten to eliminate unnecessary details, then the list of maximum 15 events was created. Below, we present the simplified versions of the prompts used to generate the events lists for GTD and Open- FEMA scenarios.4 STEP 1: Provide a brief overview with the location first, removing unnecessary details like costs, dates, injuries, responsibility, motives, related events, aftermath, and technical info. STEP 2: Create a list of events in the present tense, starting with the location, without identifying individuals. Avoid mentioning vandalism, motivations, suppositions, or related events. Provide live updates from a natural disaster, focusing only on disaster-related details. List events in real time, starting with impacted locations. Include future event times, and indicate danger when unspecified. Do not add links or current time details. Guidelines Collection. To accurately control the process of generating warning messages, we col- lected guidelines addressing message TONE and behavioral INSTRUCTIONS. TONE guidelines were gathered from a recent study by (Sutton and Kuligowski, 2019). In the project, the authors conducted a systematic review of the literature on the best practices to deliver effective communication during and in the after- math of a crisis via short-messaging channels, such as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) or Twitter. Additionally, the authors leveraged recommenda- tions and suggestions from a panel of experts to further refine the results obtained in the first phase of the project (i.e., the systematic review). The panel consisted of 17 individuals with wide exper- tise in the management of crises and emergencies via WEA and social media, who had experience in situations", "suggestions from a panel of experts to further refine the results obtained in the first phase of the project (i.e., the systematic review). The panel consisted of 17 individuals with wide exper- tise in the management of crises and emergencies via WEA and social media, who had experience in situations including floods, earthquakes, hurri- canes, terrorism attacks, and active shooter scenar- ios. The final results of the study identified five main goals that should be pursued in order to de- liver effective messages: (i) increasing attention, by designing messages to gather the receiver\u2019s fo- 4Quality control and complete prompts are presented in Appendices D and E, respectively. cus; (ii) increasing comprehension, by ensuring clarity, ease of understanding, and explicit mention of threat and location; (iii) ensuring believability, by using a known, trusted source; (iv) enhancing clarity, by avoiding possible ambiguity; and (v) trig- gering protective action, by clearly and specifically stating the behaviors to adopt in order to reduce the risk of information seeking. Full details about Tone guidelines are available in Section B of the Appendix. INSTRUCTIONS Guidelines are extracted from the official FEMA website,5 that provides specific Instructions for each type of crisis event. We col- lected all the relevant guidelines for the scenarios we gathered, discarding those guidelines not rele- vant for our dataset (e.g. instructions for specific subcategories such as explosions and power out- ages). Then we manually removed the sections that focus on how to prepare before the event, as our task was to assist civilians during and after. Warning Messages. After collecting the scenario descriptions and the corresponding events list, we used GPT-4o-mini to generate the warning mes- sages. The model was provided with the full list of events composing each scenario and tasked with producing all the messages at once, so to enhance contextual coherence among messages. Both TONE and INSTRUCTIONS guidelines were included in the prompt to ensure compliance. A simplified prompt for their generation can be found below:6 Create warning messages based on the list provided. - Structure: max 300 characters, with clear location and threat, written as standalone updates. - Tone: clear location and threat, keep anonymity, avoid alarming terms, and use clear, simple language. Avoid speculation, links, or unnecessary details. - Instructions: Provide actionable advice from given guidelines {event_instructions} Along with the messages generated using the above configuration, referred to as Good Messages, we also created their suboptimal counterparts, wich we refers to as Bad Messages. These subopti- mal versions were created to (i) explore prefer- ence alignment techniques, where a \u201cchosen\u201d out- put is compared to a \u201crejected\u201d one to guide the model toward more suitable generations, and (ii) test post-editing approaches. The Bad Messages were designed by deliberately ignoring or worsen- ing essential aspects of a good warning message. Specifically, we generated three variants: messages with poor Tone but correct Instructions ( TONE ,), 5https://www.ready.gov/ 6The complete prompts can be found in Appendix E. messages with poor Instructions but correct Tone ( INST ,), and messages where both aspects were flawed ( ALL ,).

In total, we generated 100,000 Good Messages, along with an additional 300,000 Bad Messages across nearly 18,000 scenarios spanning 13 types. Each scenario contains roughly 6 events and the average length of a warning message is 255 charac- ters. Table 1 presents the full list of scenarios and events for each typology.

To this end we focused on the Good messages quality, and the perceived difference between Good and Bad messages.7 Good Messages Quality. Two crisis communi- cation experts reviewed a subsample of 1,000 ex- amples balanced across the different disaster ty- pologies. As an intrinsic evaluation, we tasked the reviewer with signaling problematic messages and post-editing them. During revision, the experts identified 5 messages (0.5% of the total) as prob- lematic. These messages included wrong sugges- tions. Additionally, 38 messages (3.8% of the total) required minor post-editing (e.g. \u201cloud explosion\u201d modified to \u201cexplosion\u201d) with an average HTER (Snover et al., 2006) of 0.11, which is considered negligible (Turchi et al., 2013). In conclusion, the low number of experts\u2019 notes and the low HTER scores can be considered indicators of the good quality of our warning messages. 7Further details on setup, prompts, and statistical signifi- cance of both experiments are provided in Appendix F.

To assess if the Good and the Bad Messages of CrisiText dataset followed our generations guidelines, we employed a double validation process. For the first step, we set up a pairwise comparison using crowdsourcing, and asked the annotators to select which one among two messages was preferred based on each of the two guideline dimensions (Tone and Instructions). Pairs were created by selecting one good message and one randomly from either TONE ,, INSTRUCT ,, or ALL ,. After the human evaluation, we repeated the procedure using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge. The model was provided with the", "based on each of the two guideline dimensions (Tone and Instructions). Pairs were created by selecting one good message and one randomly from either TONE ,, INSTRUCT ,, or ALL ,. After the human evaluation, we repeated the procedure using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge. The model was provided with the same evaluation rules and setup, along with the message and events up to that point. The results reported in Table 2 indicate a clear-cut preference for the Good Messages over the Bad Messages with a high consistency between human and LLM judgment (with a Cohen\u2019s Kappa of 0.65 and simple agree- ment of 83.33%). It should also be noted that when INST , or TONE , are evaluated on their own di- mension their preference score is dramatically low (as expected), while they received higher prefer- ence scores when evaluated on the other dimension (e.g. TONE , has higher votes on InstLLM with re- spect to ToneLLM). This is expected since TONE , is supposed to provide a poor tone but legit instruc- tions (and the converse holds for INST ,). 5 Experiments In order to assess the effectiveness of our dataset for crisis communication scenarios, we designed vari- ous experimental setups. We simulated real-world tasks to prove that our data can improve models by making them robust under different conditions. Specifically, we fine-tuned models to perform tasks such as warning message generation (also in out-of- distribution scenario types), and warning message post-editing. Additionally, we performed ablation tests to assess the effect of providing the Instruction guidelines and the history of previous messages in these configuration. For all experiments, we used Llama-3.1-8B, testing both the Instruct and Base variants. Details of all the training and generation setups are provided in the Appendix C. Warning message generation. This first set of experiments is meant to evaluate the effectiveness of the dataset in supporting warning message gener- ation. To this end, we explored various methodolo- gies: standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a preference alignment paradigm, along with zero- shot and few-shot approaches used as baselines. The basic prompt, present in all of the configura- tions, was a short description of the task along with the chain of events of the scenario. Create a warning message informing on the current happening, providing a suggestion, for the last line in the following chain of events (be short, max 300 characters). No other output other than the message. Chain of events: {chain_of_events} Among the various preference alignment op- tions, we selected ORPO (Hong et al., 2024), a reference-model-free preference optimization tech- nique. Unlike other alignment techniques, such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024), ORPO removes the need for an additional alignment phase by in- tegrating it into the fine-tuning phase. While the SFT uses cross-entropy loss, LSFT , ORPO adds the relative ratio loss to the standard one: LORPO = E(x,yw,yl) [LSFT + \u03bb \u00b7 LOR] Like all preference alignment algorithms, ORPO requires both a chosen and a rejected output dur- ing training. By setting the three variants of Bad Message as rejected, we were able to", ", ORPO adds the relative ratio loss to the standard one: LORPO = E(x,yw,yl) [LSFT + \u03bb \u00b7 LOR] Like all preference alignment algorithms, ORPO requires both a chosen and a rejected output dur- ing training. By setting the three variants of Bad Message as rejected, we were able to extend the SFT training to three ORPO setups: ORPO TONE ,, ORPO INST ,, and ORPO ALL ,. Additional Configurations. We defined three further configurations adding specific information to the basic prompt to test how the output quality is affected: (i) previous messages from the same sce- nario, (ii) FEMA Instructions, and (iii) combining both. See appendix G for the complete prompts. Leave One Scenario Out (LOSO). These ex- periments were conducted to further explore the importance of Instructions guidelines for general- ization capabilities of fine-tuned models. We in- vestigated the model\u2019s behavior on scenarios that were left out from the training data. To do so, we selected three event types with distinct Instructions (specifically attack, tornado, and winter weather), fine-tuned a model on two of them, and tested on the excluded scenario. To ensure a fair distribution, we focused on scenarios with a single Instruction label and down-sampled the number of elements for each scenario to 1,500, in order to control for the effect of training dataset size. Post editor. The final set of experiments focuses on fine-tuning an LLM specifically for a post- editing task, to correct poorly crafted messages. We also compare its performance with the LLM used in zero-shot post-editing as a baseline. A Bad Message was provided as input and the correspond- ing Good Message as expected output. In creating such pairs we used a mixture of the three categories of Bad Messages ( TONE ,, INST ,, and ALL ,), selected through a uniform distribution, ensuring that the dataset contained one-third of each for ev- ery Good Message. 6 Evaluation and Results To evaluate the performance of our experiments, we used a combination of traditional metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. The details are provided below. Metrics. We employed overlap metrics to eval- uate the similarity between generations produced by our fine-tuned models and the Good Messages. We chose ROUGE1 and ROUGE2 (R1 and R2) (Lin, 2004), and BLEU (B) (Papineni et al., 2002). Although the metrics were developed for machine translation tasks, these metrics help us understand how closely the generation follows the desired structure and terminology. To understand how se- mantically close are the generations and the gold, we also used BERTScore (BS) (Zhang et al., 2020). BS compares the context embedding of words, providing scores that better align with humans in gen tasks. Along with the traditional metrics, we also employed the LLM-as-a-judge technique in- troduced in \u00a74 to approximate human evaluation. Base vs Instruct Models. Preliminary results show that there is no significant difference between fine-tuning the Base or the Instruct versions of Llama-3.1-8B. Since their performance is compa- rable, we chose to continue our experiments with the Instruct model. Full results can be found in Appendix H.

The subscript I refers to the incorporation of FEMA Instruc- tion in training, while M indicates the use of previous messages. ORPO corresponds to INST, and Baseline correspond to Few-shotC+I. Generation Results. Getting to the generation experiments, we compared a baseline, the SFT models, and ORPO models. As the baseline, we chose the best-performing setup among the zero- shot and few-shot approaches we tested (see Ap- pendix I), while the three ORPO setups did not ex- hibit substantial differences in terms of automatic metrics (see Appendix J). Table 3 highlights the subpar performance of the baseline, which a qual- itative analysis (Appendix L) attributes to the dif- ficulty to follow the guidelines. With respect to ORPO, SFT achieved better results across all met- rics, while the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation does not indicate a clear winner between the two approaches (see Table 4). Based on these findings, and given the high computational cost of ORPO training, we focused on SFT for the subsequent experiments.

Ablation Experiments. Focusing on the differ- ent SFT setups, Table 3 shows that including In- structions during training is not beneficial, while in- cluding previous messages improves performance. The latter helps maintaining a consistent message style across all events in the scenario, which is a de- sirable feature. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the inclusion of Instructions makes the prompt repetitive, potentially having a negative effect on the loss computation during training. A lower loss in this context may lead the model to underfit the data. In terms of automatic metrics, the best setup for the model combines Instructions and previous mes- sages during fine-tuning, although its performance is comparable to the setup that uses only previous messages. Turning to the LLM-as-a-judge evalua- tion, presented in Table 5, it is consistent with the results of the automatic metrics. SFTI+M is the most frequently selected across both categories. These results are consistent with the qualitative analysis in Appendix L.

Applying automatic metrics to LOSO generations yields only small differences between using FEMA Instructions and not. This can be ex- plained by the fact that generated messages are typ- ically composed of two sentences: the alert (which describes the threat) and the suggestion (which pro- vides instructions on how to respond). Without proper Instruction guidelines, the model can still learn to generate the alert part correctly (which is independent from the FEMA instructions) but struggles with producing accurate behavioral sug- gestions (which are instead dependent on FEMA instructions). This is confirmed by Table 6, which shows a noticeable difference in the suggestion part depending on whether Instructions were used.

Turning to the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and differentiating among the three scenario typologies, Table 7 clearly shows that the judge perceives a difference between the two training setups. For the excluded scenario, messages generated by the model trained with Instructions are significantly better than those produced by a model trained with- out them. Notably the Tornado scenario exhibits the smallest difference. This could be explained by the model\u2019s implicit knowledge of specific Instruc- tions before fine-tuning. To confirm this, we used the Perplexity (PPL) metric (Arora and Rangarajan, 2016). PPL measures how well an LLM predicts the next token in a sequence, indicating how fa- miliar it is with the text. As shown in Table 8, the Tornado Instructions have the lowest PPL scores, indicating that generating correct suggestions for this scenario was easier even without fine-tuning.

Post-Editor. Table 9 reports the metrics for the post-editor experiments. We applied automatic metrics to compare all variants of Bad Messages ( TONE ,, INSTRUCT ,, or ALL ,) with their post- edited counterparts, from both the zero-shot and fine-tuned versions of the model. The rationale behind these comparisons is to evaluate if, after the post-editing, the Bad Messages get closer to the Good Messages. The table clearly shows that the fine-tuned version of the model achieves bet- ter results than the zero-shot one. The Bad Mes- sages have lower scores on all the metrics, as ex- pected. However, the relatively higher scores of the INST , can be attributed to their generation method, which produces plausible but incorrect suggestions, while maintaining proper communica- tion.

The dataset covers 13 emergency categories and includes 18,000 crisis scenarios, pro- viding 100,000 events. Each event is associated with one Good Message and three types of Bad Messages, totaling over 400,000 messages. We experimented with Llama 3 models, applying both Supervised Fine-Tuning on Good Messages and a preference alignment technique, ORPO, that also uses Bad Messages. The models were tested on two tasks: warning message generation and post- editing. Results show that SFT yields better scores than ORPO on overlapping-based metrics, while showed similar performance when evaluated using the LLM-as-a-judge. Further experiments showed how warning message generation improves by pro- viding additional context, i.e. specific guidelines and/or history of previous messages. The impor- tance of adapting to local/different emergency pro- tocols is addressed in LOSO experiments, showing that explicitly including guidelines during train- ing helps the model in adapting to new protocols at inference time. Finally, we fine-tuned an auto- matic post-editor using Bad Messages, achieving a noticeable improvement in correcting inaccurate messages. We believe that this dataset is a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven crisis communi- cation. Limitations We emphasize that products based on this dataset should be used as tools to assist humans rather than as a complete replacement for experts, espe- cially when communicating with civilians or deal- ing with real-world situations. While the dataset has been constructed using SOTA LLMs and ex- pert guidelines, it is important to note that it is synthetic. Some biases from the LLM that gener- ated it are likely present. Also, even though the generation process follows carefully designed in- structions, LLMs are inherently prone to halluci- nations. Given the large size of the dataset, the presence of some suboptimal elements is plausible. Beyond these aspects, we acknowledge that our work focused primarily on the quality", "it are likely present.

Given the large size of the dataset, the presence of some suboptimal elements is plausible. Beyond these aspects, we acknowledge that our work focused primarily on the quality of message generation, with limited analysis of factual accu- racy, or the potential harmful impact of misleading warning messages. For these reasons, we stress that our approach is meant to be used to assist human experts, not to replace them, as in every sensitive scenario where AI is used. Additionally, message personalization was not considered in this work, as our focus was on broadcast communication rather than narrowcasting.

A Scenarios Filtering To obtain a subset of the GTD scenarios charac- terized by urban situations, such as a terrorist at- tack in a city center, we stored the scenario de- scriptions from five different regions: Australa- sia & Oceania, East Asia, Eastern Europe, North America, and Western Europe. Additionally, we focused on five attack types: Armed Assault, Bomb- ing/Explosion, Facility/infrastructure Attack, Hi- jacking, and Hostage Taking. For the OpenFEMA archive, the first step in- volved collecting entries with the label \u201cUrgency\u201d classified as Expected or Immediate, \u201cSeverity\u201d cat- egorized as Extreme, Severe, or Moderate, and \u201cCategory\u201d labeled as Geo, Met, Fire, Health, Env, or CBRNE. In the second step we collected data related to wildfires, floods, abnormal heat, hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and win- ter weather. Moreover, we extracted landslides, tsunamis and volcano events from the Special Weather category. Additionally, avalanche scenar- ios were separated from winter weather. While earthquake scenarios were also collected, the ma- jority consisted of test messages. Thus, we decided to generate them entirely using synthetic data. We synthetically generated 100 earthquake events lists by generating scenarios using GPT-3.5- turbo-0125 (Temperature and top P = 1, max tokens = 500, and frequency and presence penalty = 0.5). To add variety to the generated scenarios, we ran- domized city, magnitude, and the number of events in the scenarios. Generate a dotted list of the live event of an earthquake of magnitude {magnitude} for city {city}. The list have to start with an earthquake happening. Only gives information about the earthquake. Do not report how the event is felt across the city. DO NOT give indications or suggestions on what to do. The dotted list has to describe the chain of events. Write like you are obtaining information at the moment (like a live report). Do not give narrative details, only focus on events details. Max {number_of_element} points in the list. If the number of events exceeded three, the prompt also asked for information about possible", "to describe the chain of events. Write like you are obtaining information at the moment (like a live report). Do not give narrative details, only focus on events details. Max {number_of_element} points in the list. If the number of events exceeded three, the prompt also asked for information about possible or ongoing aftershocks. Additionally, with a 40% probability, the prompt included a request to men- tion evacuation zones. B Full Communication Guidelines Below, we report the full guidelines as gathered from (Sutton and Kuligowski, 2019). The study provided information and guidance on how to write effective messages in situations of crisis through a systematic review of the extant literature and the guidance of a panel of experts. We derive five sep- arate goals from the article that should be pursued when aiming to deliver messages that are both use- ful and effective in reducing negative consequences in the aftermath of situations of emergency. Increasing attention. Short messages should be designed to grab the attention of the message re- ceiver by providing: \u2022 Most up to date and relevant info, along with source \u2022 A specific focus on hazard threat and impact, location of incident, instructions about protec- tive actions to be taken \u2022 Sentences using all caps, imperative and di- rective statements, colors and even hashtags \u2022 Images, when possible \u2022 No external links Increasing comprehension. Short messages for imminent threats should be easily understandable. Therefore, they must be written to ensure: \u2022 Few (or possibly no) abbreviations, acronyms \u2022 No technical jargon \u2022 Clear identification of the threat and interested locations \u2022 No need for subjective interpretation \u2022 Use of maps if possible Ensuring believability. A known and trusted source is fundamental to ensure that people will take the message with the needed attention. Also: \u2022 Alert messages should be used sparingly \u2022 They should accurately reflect the seriousness and time of the event \u2022 Source, which should be stated early in the message, must be recognizable \u2022 Too many alerts decrease believability, the same applies to the perception of excessive delays between the event and the message Enhancing clarity. Short messages should con- tain unambiguous action phrases that portray the seriousness of the event and the associated need to take protective measures. So: \u2022 The use of unclear terminology or non- specific location risk information negatively impacts the public perception of risk \u2022 The use of words describing the seriousness of the events increase people\u2019s sense of urgency Triggering Protective Action. Short messages for imminent threat should include clear and spe- cific protective action statements to reduce the urge of people to seek information elsewhere. Hence, the fundamental elements to be included are: \u2022 Source \u2022 Hazard \u2022 Location \u2022 Guidance \u2022 Time C Experiments and Data Generation Arguments GPT Generation. For dataset generation, we used the OpenAI library to generate text via their API, with the parameters set to a temperature of 1, a top-p of 1, and a maximum token limit of 4096. Dataset Splits. To train models with our data, we used an 80-10-10 split for the", "Generation. For dataset generation, we used the OpenAI library to generate text via their API, with the parameters set to a temperature of 1, a top-p of 1, and a maximum token limit of 4096. Dataset Splits. To train models with our data, we used an 80-10-10 split for the training, devel- opment, and test sets. We first collected scenarios based on the main disaster type, then shuffled and split them accordingly. LoRA Adapter Configuration. For all train- ing, we used a LoRA adapter from the peft li- brary on top of the model with the following pa- rameters: a LoRA rank of 16, a LoRA alpha of 16, and a LoRA dropout of 0. The adapters were applied to the following target modules: [\u201cq_proj\u201d, \u201ck_proj\u201d, \u201cv_proj\u201d, \u201co_proj\u201d, \u201cgate_proj\u201d, \u201cup_proj\u201d, \u201cdown_proj\u201d]. SFT. We used Hugging Face\u2019s trl library with SFTTrainer, configuring the training as follows: a maximum sequence length of 2024, early stop- ping patience of 5, a learning rate of 3e-4, and a cosine scheduler. The training batch size was 2, the evaluation batch size was 4, and gradients were ac- cumulated over 4 steps. Training ran for 10 epochs with a weight decay of 0.01 and a warmup ratio of 0.03. for the base SFT setup (no previous messages and no FEMA Instructions) we used a lower maxi- mum sequence length of 512 and a higher training batch size of 4. The final model was selected based on the lowest validation loss. ORPO Training. For ORPO training, we used the ORPOTrainer from the trl library. The param- eters were the same as those in SFT, except for a maximum sequence length of 512. LOSO Setup. The LOSO setup used a maximum sequence length of 1024, as it did not need to han- dle excessively long prompts. Unlike other setups, it contained no more than one FEMA Instruction and did not include previous messages. Post-Editor Setup. For the post-editor, we set the maximum sequence length to 600 and the batch size to 4. This setup included only the two mes- sages, without additional context. Truncation Strategy and Chat Formatting. The truncation side was set to left to retain the most relevant content, prioritizing the message to be generated over the instruction or previous mes- sages. The Llama chat template was used to define turns between the assistant and the user. Llama Generation. The generation setup used a temperature and top-p of 1, generating 128 new tokens, as warning messages do not require many tokens. Evaluation Packages. For automatic met- rics, we used Hugging Face\u2019s evaluate library, importing ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore. BERTScore was computed us- ing the microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli model to measure similarity. D Event Extraction Quality Control During the event extraction phase, we tested multi- ple prompts to minimize the presence of elements that are not standard in broadcast communication. Some of these elements are still present in the dataset. This is not necessarily detrimental, as it helps the model to be more robust in dealing with any information a human operator may consider im- portant. To investigate the quality of", "of elements that are not standard in broadcast communication. Some of these elements are still present in the dataset. This is not necessarily detrimental, as it helps the model to be more robust in dealing with any information a human operator may consider im- portant. To investigate the quality of the extracted events, we manually reviewed a small subsample of those generated using the final prompt, classi- fying them into four categories: (i) Good (needs to be communicated), (ii) Neutral (might be com- municated if the operator deems it necessary), (iii) Not standard (events connected to the scenario that do not need to be communicated), and (iv) Unre- lated (events not connected to the specific scenario). The evaluation returned the following results: 82% Good, 13% Neutral, and 5% Not standard, while there were no Unrelated events. Since the critical aspect was to avoid unrelated events and keep the Not standard ones as low as possible, we consid- ered this sufficient to proceed with the full extrac- tion process. Type Example Good A severe storm was located 4 miles west of Rutledge, and 6 miles west of Luverne. Neutral Minor hail damage to vehicles expected. Not standard The home of a Catholic woman sustains damages during the storm. Unrelated A wildfire broke out near Santa Rosa, Cal- ifornia. Table 11: Examples of the four event categories used for quality control. E CrisiText Dataset Generation Prompts In this section, we provide the complete prompts for each generation. These were considered the best prompts to guide the generation toward our goals, for both events and messages. GTD Scenarios. For the first step of event extrac- tion for GTD, we removed unnecessary details, fo- cusing solely on the attack and excluding damages, responsibility claims, and post-attack outcomes, as they are irrelevant to crisis communication. Rewrite the text following these guidelines: - It is important to specify the precise location early in the text. - Remove any reference to cost of damage. - Remove dates and hours indications. - Do not report who and how much are injured. - Do not report claims of responsibility or motivations. - Do not report details happening after the end of the attack. - Do not report linked cases or events prior to the attack. - Do not report technical details. Text: {scenario[\"summary\"]} In the second step, we extracted lists from the cleaned descriptions, applying additional filtering. We observed that GPT-4o-mini sometimes inferred steps when lacking sufficient information. Since our task does not require strictly factual reporting, this enrichment added useful details and context. Create a dotted list if the following scenario reporting the chain of events of the text. - Use only information of the scenario. - Write to the present. - Each point is a description of its associated event. - Keep anonymity of involved persons but it is important to be precise with the location\u2019s name. - Do not report vandalism or motivations for the attack. - Do not report suppositions and related attacks. The event associated to the location have to be specified early. Scenario: {corrected_scenario} OpenFEMA", "event. - Keep anonymity of involved persons but it is important to be precise with the location\u2019s name. - Do not report vandalism or motivations for the attack. - Do not report suppositions and related attacks. The event associated to the location have to be specified early. Scenario: {corrected_scenario} OpenFEMA Scenarios. As with GTD scenarios, we cleaned the OpenFEMA descriptions to remove details irrelevant to public information. We explic- itly instructed to specify the threat type for better clarity. Given a description of a natural disaster ({disaster}), extract the live updates from it. Make a dotted list (in english) and write as the information are obtained in real time. If not specified, specify what is the danger. Focus on extracting disaster information. The dotted list (with - and no indentations) have to describe the chain of event characterizing the event. Time information are reported only when talking about future events. Do not report internet links and present hours. If they are reported, impacted locations have to be at the start of the list. Text: {event[\u2019description\u2019]} Some event descriptions were excessively long, leading GPT-4o-mini too extract too long lists. To address this, we forcibly trimmed lists exceeding 15 elements. Below is the prompt used for regener- ating the event list. Create a dotted list extracting the most relevant point of the given dotted list (from 5 to 10 points) The list have to describe the chain of events of a natural disaster. Dotted list: {response} Good Messages. Below is the prompt used to generate Good Messages. We refer to dotted lists as numbered lists, as GPT-4o-mini generates mes- sages more reliably when each step is numbered. The prompt includes formatting guidelines, Tone guidelines, and Instruction guidelines for each label of the scenario. If the scenario has n labels: Generate warning messages modifying the numbered list given next, follow these details: - Each message must be numbered (number and a -). - Max 300 character per message. - Create messages for ALL of the specified points. - Location and threat have to be clear in every message. - Keep anonymity of involved persons but it is important to be precise with the location\u2019s name in every message. - Modify each item to make it more readable. Warn readers of what is happening live. - Messages do not know the information contained in the next points. - Avoid terminologies that may cause panic in the reader. - Avoid terms such as \"terrorist\", \"dangerous\", \"extreme\", or the type of weapon used. - Each message must offer suggestions on what to do. - For suggestions, find the most relevant information from these documents: For {guideline_1_name}: {guideline_1_text} ... For {guideline_n_name}: {guideline_n_text} Numbered list: {numbered_list} Bad Messages. For TONE ,, we used a sensa- tional journalistic style. After several tests, we identified this approach as the most effective way to produce terminology that appears informative while still inducing panic. Generate warning messages modifying the numbered list given next, follow these details: - Each message must be numbered (number and a -). - Max 300 character per message. - Create", "tests, we identified this approach as the most effective way to produce terminology that appears informative while still inducing panic.

Numbered list: {numbered_list} For ALL ,, we combined both dimensions to further degrade the quality of the messages. To achieve this, we also removed the requirement for suggestions to be somewhat reasonable, resulting in completely ineffective and misleading messages. Generate warning messages modifying the numbered list given next, follow these details: - Each message must be numbered (number and a -). - Max 300 character per message. - Create messages for ALL of the specified points. - Messages do not know the information contained in the next points. - Write in a sensational journalistic style. - Use panic-inducing terminology. - Each message must offer suggestions. - Suggestions must contain flaws or be slightly off but still sound realistic and plausible to the reader. Numbered list: {numbered_list} F Data Quality Assessment Good Messages Quality Annotation. To eval- uate Good Messages, the data was organized in a Google Sheet to allow for corrections and provide feedback on each message. In addition to the statis- tics reported in \u00a74, 19 messages (in the Hurricane and Tornado scenarios) were flagged as containing a specific, correct suggestion added by GPT that was not present in FEMA\u2019s guidelines. Good vs Bad Messages Quality Annotation. Quality was defined in terms of Good messages being perceived", "addition to the statis- tics reported in \u00a74, 19 messages (in the Hurricane and Tornado scenarios) were flagged as containing a specific, correct suggestion added by GPT that was not present in FEMA\u2019s guidelines. Good vs Bad Messages Quality Annotation. Quality was defined in terms of Good messages being perceived as better with respect to Bad Mes- sages. We did not compare Bad Messages against each other since this is not relevant for our work. To perform the data quality check, we selected 5 batches of 6 message pairs, each with the same label typologies: 3 with \u201cattack\u201d, 1 with \u201cexplo- sion, attack\u201d, and 1 with \u201churricane\u201d. To conduct this study, we used Prolific,8 a platform that grants fair payment, to select trustworthy annotators. We restricted the pool to native English speakers from the UK and USA with a 100% acceptance rate. We selected a total of 30 messages, evaluated by 4 an- notators each. This subset size was chosen follow- ing Hugging Face\u2019s LLM-as-a-judge cookbook,9 which indicates that 30 samples are sufficient to ob- tain a good correlation between human judgments and model evaluations. Forms were created using the Google Forms en- vironment. At the start of each form, FEMA\u2019s In- structions for the relevant scenario typologies were provided. Each annotator was presented with the preceding events and the current event characteriz- ing the scenario, along with two warning messages (one from one of the three Bad Messages categories and one Good Message). Annotators were asked to select the message that best aligned with two dimensions: Tone and Instructions. 8https://www.prolific.com/ 9https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/llm_ judge The guidelines for the task are detailed below: Thanks for participating in our task. You will be presented with 6 scenarios. Each scenario contains a \"current event\" that you should focus on and, if available, a list of \"previous events\". You are asked to evaluate the best message between two options (related to the \"current event\") based on two criteria: 1. **Clarity and Terminology**: The message that is the clearest and uses the most appropriate terminology, while inducing the least amount of panic. 2. **Guidelines Adherence**: Based on the provided guidelines, the message that best aligns with them and is most useful in addressing the situation. Please review these criteria carefully before making your choice, as the guidelines may vary across different forms. To further confirm the quality, we asked two ex- pert annotators to perform the same evaluation on 50 messages each. This extension allowed us to obtain a total of 220 choices (4 annotators \u00d7 30 instances + 2 annotators \u00d7 50 instances). A bino- mial test confirmed the significance of the results across both dimensions and for each Bad Message category. Table 12 provides a detailed summary of the results.

To minimize confusion, the evaluation of the two di- mensions was conducted in two separate inference iterations. The prompts used for the evaluations are provided below. You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two warning messages. - **Scenario:** These messages were generated for type. Messages are generated for the last one of the following events: events - **Purpose:** The messages aim to inform the public. **Messages to Compare:** - **Message A:** message_a - **Message B:** message_b **Your Task:** Compare the messages based on how well they balance clarity and tone. Evaluate which message: 1. Is clearer and easier to understand. 2. Uses calm, neutral language that avoids panic-inducing terms. Identify the message that achieves the best tradeoff between these two aspects. At the end report your choice, exactly in this format \"Choice: [A/B].\" You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two warning messages. - **Scenario:** These messages were generated for type.

Evaluate which message better aligns with the provided guidelines and delivers the most appropriate advice. At the end report your choice, exactly in this format \"Choice: [A/B].\" G Training Prompts The prompt template that we used in our training se- tups, with all optional blocks shown in curly brack- ets, is: Based on the provided guidelines, Create a warning message informing on the current happening, providing a suggestion, for the last line in the following chain of events (be short, max 300 characters). No other output other than the message. {Guidelines Block} {Previous messages Block} Chain of events: {chain_of_events} The Guidelines block contains the FEMA In- structions relative to every labels characterizing the crisis scenario. If a scenario has n labels the block takes the form: Guidelines: For {guideline_1_name}: {guideline_1_text} ... For {guideline_n_name}: {guideline_n_text} The Previous Messages Block includes the mes- sages corresponding to earlier events in the same scenario. When generating the n-th message of a scenario, the block takes the form: Previous messages: {previous_message_1} ... {previous_message_(n-1)} The base prompt, without additional blocks, is used for SFT and all ORPO configurations, while SFTI, SFTM, and SFTI+M use combinations of the optional blocks.

I Best Baseline The baseline presented in Table 3 represents the best-performing one, identified across multiple zero-shot and few-shot configurations. For both of these techniques, we computed automatic metrics over three configurations: (i) without additional information, (ii) with communication guidelines and FEMA Instructions, and (iii) with communica- tion guidelines, FEMA Instructions, and previous messages. The prompt template that we used, with all optional blocks shown in curly brackets, is: Based on the provided guidelines, Create a warning message informing on the current happening, providing a suggestion, for the last line in the following chain of events (be short, max 300 characters). No other output other than the message. {Guidelines Block} {Examples Block} {Previous messages Block} Chain of events: {chain_of_events} To switch from a zero-shot to a few-shot setup, we added the Example Block. This block contains two example chains of events and their correspond- ing output messages, chosen according to the label of each scenario. The format is: Example: Chain of events: {chain_of_events_for_labels_eg_1} Message: {message_for_labels_eg_1} Chain of events: {chain_of_events_for_labels_eg_2} Message: {message_for_labels_eg_2} End of example The Guidelines block consists of two parts: fixed communication guidelines (the same used during the generation of the dataset E) and FEMA Instruc- tions (as we did in the training prompts G). The full block is reported below: Communication guidelines: - Location and threat have to be clear in every message. - Keep anonymity of involved persons but it is important to be precise with the location\u2019s name in every message. - Modify each item to make it more readable. Warn readers of what is happening live. - Avoid terminologies that may cause panic in the reader. - Avoid terms such as \u201cterrorist\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cextreme\u201d, and similar. - Each message must offer suggestions on what to do. Guidelines: For {guideline_1_name}: {guideline_1_text} ... For {guideline_n_name}: {guideline_n_text} Finally, the Previous Messages Block is identical to that described in Appendix G. Previous messages: {previous_message_1} ... {previous_message_(n-1)} In Table 14, we report the automatic metric scores for each setup.

L Generation Qualitative Analysis To gain better insights on the characteristics of the generated warning messages, we performed a qual- itative analysis comparing the main approaches we used: zero-shot, few-shot, and SFT. In this analysis we included the best- vs worst-performing setups of each technique. The chosen worst setups are Zero-shot, Few-shot, and SFT, while the best ones are Zero-shotC+I, Few-shotC+I, and SFTI+M.

SFT vs SFTI+M. There are no significant differ- ences between the two: both succeed in producing non\u2013panic-inducing messages that are informative and provide correct advice contextualized to the situation. The terminology is generally better in the SFTI+M setup than in the SFT one, likely due to greater exposure during training to similar mes- sages and FEMA Instructions (since the best setup includes previous messages and FEMA texts). Zero-shot vs Zero-shotC+I. Both version have poor performances for different reasons. The Zero- shot setup produces very short messages that con- tain missing/incomplete event information and/or recommendations. Furthermore messages contain panic inducing terminology. Both problems can be explained by the absence of any guideline. The Zero-shotC+I, on the other hand, generates mes- sages with more complete information about both the events and the recommendations. However, it produces excessively long messages often us- ing a journalistic reporting style. Moreover, the recommendations are not always correct, as they sometimes fail to warn about the current event (a problem that also occurs in the Few-shot setups, as discussed in the next paragraph). Few-shot vs Few-shotC+I. In these experiments, the generated messages show better adherence to the desired style compared to the zero-shot setups: short, with compliant suggestions, and non\u2013panic- inducing terminology. This improvement is mostly due to the presence of examples in the prompt. There are no major differences between the two setups, as also confirmed by the automatic metrics in Table 14. Still, given the absence of guidelines, Few-shot setup is sometimes prone to generating messages deviating from the expected message for- mat. The main issue with both setups is their ten- dency to fail to generate a message for the last element in the chain of events (the one that should be communicated). Instead, they often produce a message for another event or a summary of a previous one, which can lead to the omission of important details that needed to be communicated. SFTI+M vs Zero-shotC+I vs Few-shotC+I. Based on the previous insights and analysis, we conclude that SFT is the most suitable option for the Warning Message Generation task, as it produces reliable and informative outputs, which are essential for this application. The other two techniques cannot be considered reliable in these aspects. Table 18 presents a comparison of the warning messages generated by the 6 techniques discussed above (SFT, SFTI+M, Zero-shot, Zero-shotC+I, Few- shot and Few-shotC+I), while Table 19 presents a comparison between the three best-performing setups. Finally Table 17 presents the generation lengths of the various techniques, supporting the discussion in this section.

Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model\u2019s innate agent capa- bilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by 34.1%, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly 9% relative, maintaining exceptional training stability. 1 INTRODUCTION Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a spectrum of specialized tasks, including math (Shao et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025), coding (Zheng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024), and creative writing (Chakrabarty et al., 2024; Marco et al., 2024). However, a fundamental limitation persists: their knowledge is inherently static, confined to the data on which they were trained. To overcome this knowledge cutoff, a dominant approach is to equip LLMs with search capabilities, transforming them into agents that can actively query external knowledge sources (Jin et al., 2025b). This ability is a prime example of tool-calling (Schick et al., 2023), where the model learns to interact with an external search tool to solve problems it cannot answer alone. Mastering this skill requires learning a complex, multi-step policy, framing the task as a sequential decision-making problem ideal for Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which relies on costly static demonstrations and fails to teach exploration, RL provides a framework for LLMs to learn effective policies through trial-and-error (Chu et al., 2025). Consequently, value-free methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) have become a dominant paradigm, prized for their simplicity and reduced memory overhead. However, despite its success in more constrained tasks, applying GRPO to the open-ended domain of interactive search reveals critical instabilities (Jin et al., 2025b; Yu et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). This fragility stems from two fundamental flaws. First, as identified by Zheng et al. (2025), GRPO\u2019s token-level objective is ill-posed when paired with a sequence-level reward, creating high-variance gradients that destabilize training. Second, the sparse rewards inherent to search tasks often yield sample groups with homogeneous outcomes (e.g., all successes or all failures), causing the advantage signal to collapse and providing no learning signal, which severely hinders sample efficiency (Yu et al., 2025; Liu", "sequence-level reward, creating high-variance gradients that destabilize training. Second, the sparse rewards inherent to search tasks often yield sample groups with homogeneous outcomes (e.g., all successes or all failures), causing the advantage signal to collapse and providing no learning signal, which severely hinders sample efficiency (Yu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). To address these core challenges of instability and inefficient learning, we introduce Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO). Our algorithm synthesizes and refines key principles from recent policy optimization research. DSPO adopts the sequence-level optimization from GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025) to match the unit of optimiza- tion with the unit of reward. This aligns the optimization objective with the reward signal, fundamentally stabilizing the learning process for long-horizon reasoning tasks. Furthermore, DSPO incorporates a dynamic outcome-based filtering mechanism inspired by DAPO (Yu et al., 2025). This component actively constructs training batches from rollout groups containing both successful and unsuccessful outcomes for each prompt. It guarantees the advantage signal \u02c6Ai to be effective and stable. By integrating these two components into a single, coherent framework, DSPO 1 arXiv:2510.09255v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning queries Search Engine Policy Model queries queries Rollout 1 Rollout 2 Rollout G ......

For a given query, the policy model generates a group of G trajectories by interacting with the search environment. Each trajectory is assigned a sparse terminal reward.

Advantages are computed and used to update the policy model via sequence-level objective. provides a stable and high-performance algorithm designed for complex, multi-turn search and reasoning tasks. Our model achieves a 34.1% relative improvement over a leading 7B baseline (Jin et al., 2025b) and even surpasses its 14B counterpart (Jin et al., 2025a) on complex multi-hop benchmarks like HotpotQA, outperforming it by nearly 9% relative (0.613 vs. 0.563). In summary, our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose DSPO, an improved RL algorithm that overcomes the core instability and sample-inefficiency issues in training agentic search models. It achieves this by unifying two key principles into a single cohesive framework: sequence-level optimization for robust policy updates and dynamic outcome-based filtering for a dense and effective learning signal. \u2022 We demonstrate DSPO\u2019s substantial performance gains through rigorous benchmarking.

A key shift towards value-free optimization is marked by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which simplifies training by deriving a reward signal from group statistics. However, GRPO\u2019s token-level objective is known to cause training instability (Liu et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025), prompting several targeted improvements. GSPO addresses this by shifting to a sequence-level objective to match the unit of reward (Zheng et al., 2025), while DAPO tackles inefficient learning from sparse rewards with a dynamic outcome-based sampling mechanism (Yu et al., 2025). In a similar vein, GMPO stabilizes the token-level objective using a geometric-mean aggregation to reduce sensitivity to outliers (Zhao et al., 2025). Despite these advances, we observed these algorithms still face challenges like training collapse or performance bottlenecks in our experiments. Building upon the aforementioned research, we propose our improved algorithm, synthesizing the principles of sequence-level optimization and dynamic filtering and filling into a unified algorithm to overcome the unique challenges of training autonomous search agents. 2Corresponding author.

Classic RAG frameworks employ dense retrievers to fetch relevant documents, which are then concatenated into the LLM\u2019s input for generation (Karpukhin et al., 2020). How- ever, these approaches often rely on fixed pipelines, limiting autonomy in complex, multi-turn scenarios. Recently, research has evolved toward agentic paradigms, where LLMs act as autonomous agents capable of planning, search- ing, and reasoning iteratively. Frameworks like ReAct synergize reasoning and acting, enabling LLMs to interact with tools for tasks such as web navigation (Yao et al., 2023), while multi-agent systems, including AutoGen, facilitate collaborative workflows (Wu et al., 2024). Recent innovations emphasize agentic RAG and RL integration, where agents enhance retrieval through decision-making. Wu et al. (2025) introduce Agentic Reasoning, a framework inte- grating external tools for streamlined LLM reasoning. Some RL-integrated approaches (Jin et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025) train LLMs to interleave reasoning and search using purely RL. The end-to-end paradigm internalizes agent capabilities and can avoid the engineering overhead of multi-agent frameworks. However, these methods still grapple with the training instability", "reasoning.

The end-to-end paradigm internalizes agent capabilities and can avoid the engineering overhead of multi-agent frameworks. However, these methods still grapple with the training instability and performance limitation to the open-ended search domain. Our work directly confronts these bottlenecks. DSPO provides a robust and efficient training framework that ensures stable policy optimization, enabling LLMs to learn effective multi-turn search strategies. 3 METHODOLOGY In this section, we first formulate the task of agentic search as a RL problem and review prior policy optimization algorithms, highlighting their limitations in this context. We then introduce our proposed algorithm, Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO), detailing its core components for training stability and training effi- ciency. Finally, we present the integrated training algorithm. 3.1 PRELIMINARIES Policy Gradient Methods for LLMs. Training LLMs via RL often employs policy gradient methods like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), a popular algorithm for LLM alignment. It optimizes a policy \u03c0\u03b8 by maximizing a clipped surrogate objective function using samples from an old policy \u03c0\u03b8old. The objective, averaged over tokens, is given by: JPPO(\u03b8) = Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|x) \uf8ee \uf8f01 |y| |y| X t=1 min \u0010 rt(\u03b8) \u02c6At, clip (rt (\u03b8) , 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6At \u0011 \uf8f9 \uf8fb, (1) where rt(\u03b8) = \u03c0\u03b8(yt|x,y<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yt|x,y<t) is the token-level importance ratio. However, PPO relies on a separately trained value model to estimate token-level advantages \u02c6At via Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2015), introducing significant memory overhead and can be a source of instability. To address this, GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) was proposed. GRPO eliminates the need for a value model by sampling a group of G responses {yi}G i=1 for a given prompt x. It then calculates the advantage of each response by normalizing its reward against the group\u2019s statistics. Like PPO, it optimizes the objective at the token level: JGRPO(\u03b8) = Ex\u223cD,{yi}G i=1\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|x) \uf8ee \uf8f01 G G X i=1 1 |yi| |yi| X t=1 min \u0010 ri,t(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai, clip(ri,t(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6Ai \u0011 \u2212\u03b2DKL(\u03c0\u03b8||\u03c0ref) \uf8f9 \uf8fb, (2) where ri,t(\u03b8) = \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t|x,yi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi,t|x,yi,<t), and the advantage for every token yi,t in a response yi is set to the same sequence- level value: \u02c6Ai,t = \u02c6Ai = Ri \u2212mean(R) std(R) , (3) Crucially, all tokens within a given response yi share the same advantage \u02c6Ai, which is derived from the sequence-level reward. 3 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning Agentic Search as a Markov Decision Process. We formalize the multi-turn search and reasoning task as a discrete- time, finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). \u2022 State (st): A state represents the history of interaction at step t, consisting of the initial question q and all preceding agent-generated text (thoughts, search queries) and environment responses (search results). \u2022 Action (at): An action is a sequence of tokens generated by the LLM policy \u03c0\u03b8. An action sequence termi- nates when the agent either emits a special </tool_call> token to call the", "the initial question q and all preceding agent-generated text (thoughts, search queries) and environment responses (search results). \u2022 Action (at): An action is a sequence of tokens generated by the LLM policy \u03c0\u03b8. An action sequence termi- nates when the agent either emits a special </tool_call> token to call the search engine or a </answer> token to conclude the trajectory. \u2022 Policy (\u03c0\u03b8): The policy is the LLM itself, parameterized by \u03b8, which generates a distribution over the next token given the current state. \u2022 Trajectory (\u03c4): A trajectory is a full sequence of states and actions, \u03c4 = (s1, a1, . . . , sT , aT ), generated by the agent interacting with the search environment. \u2022 Reward (R(\u03c4)): We employ a sparse, terminal reward function. A trajectory receives R = 1 if the generated answer contains the ground-truth answer string, and R = 0 otherwise. R(y) = \u001a1 if agold \u2208apred 0 otherwise (4) RL with a Search Engine. Following Jin et al. (2025b), we explicitly model the search engine, denoted as R, as part of the environment. The policy LLM \u03c0\u03b8 learns to generate trajectories by interleaving reasoning with calls to R. The overall optimization problem is to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward, regularized by a KL divergence term to prevent large deviations from a reference policy \u03c0ref: max \u03c0\u03b8 Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x;R) [R(x, y)] \u2212\u03b2DKL [\u03c0\u03b8(y|x; R)||\u03c0ref(y|x; R)] . (5) Here, y \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x; R) signifies that the trajectory y is generated through a multi-step process involving both the policy\u2019s token generation and the information returned by the search engine R. Motivation for DSPO. While frameworks like Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025b) have successfully framed agentic search as an RL problem, applying conventional algorithms like PPO or GRPO faces significant hurdles. The open-ended nature of the search environment exacerbates the instability of token-level optimization. A core issue is the fundamen- tal mismatch between the unit of sequence-level reward assignment and the unit of token-level optimization (Zheng et al., 2025). This discrepancy leads to high-variance gradient estimates that accumulate over long trajectories, often culminating in policy collapse. Furthermore, the sparse binary reward signal means many training batches may contain only successful or only unsuccessful trajectories, yielding abnormal advantage and thus providing no learning signal, which drastically reduces sample efficiency (Yu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). DSPO is designed to directly counteract these two critical failure modes. 3.2 DYNAMIC-FILTER SEQUENCE-LEVEL POLICY OPTIMIZATION DSPO introduces two key innovations over prior methods: (1) it performs policy optimization at the sequence level, aligning the training objective with the trajectory-based reward structure, and (2) it incorporates a dynamic filtering mechanism to ensure every training batch provides a high-quality, non-zero learning signal. The entire training process, which integrates these components, is depicted in Figure 1. 3.2.1 SEQUENCE-LEVEL POLICY OPTIMIZATION FOR ENHANCED STABILITY Inspired by GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025), we replace the unstable token-level importance ratio with a theoretically grounded sequence-level counterpart. The sequence-level importance ratio si(\u03b8) for a response yi is defined as the geometric mean of its token-level ratios: si(\u03b8)", "in Figure 1. 3.2.1 SEQUENCE-LEVEL POLICY OPTIMIZATION FOR ENHANCED STABILITY Inspired by GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025), we replace the unstable token-level importance ratio with a theoretically grounded sequence-level counterpart. The sequence-level importance ratio si(\u03b8) for a response yi is defined as the geometric mean of its token-level ratios: si(\u03b8) = \u0012 \u03c0\u03b8(yi|x) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi|x) \u0013 1 |yi| = exp \uf8eb \uf8ed1 |yi| |yi| X t=1 log \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t|x, yi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi,t|x, yi,<t) \uf8f6 \uf8f8. (6) This length normalization is crucial for reducing variance and ensuring that si(\u03b8) remains within a consistent numerical range regardless of sequence length, which is vital for stable clipping. 4 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning Gradient Analysis. The gradient analysis below shows why DSPO enhances the stability. The gradient of the token-level GRPO objective (unclipped) scales each token\u2019s log-probability gradient by a noisy, token-specific weight ri,t(\u03b8). In contrast, the gradient of our sequence-level objective scales the average log-probability gradient of the entire sequence by a single, more stable sequence-level weight si(\u03b8): \u2207\u03b8JGRPO \u221dE \uf8ee \uf8f0\u02c6Ai \u00b7 |yi| X t=1 ri,t(\u03b8)\u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t| . . . ) \uf8f9 \uf8fb (7) \u2207\u03b8JDSPO \u221dE \uf8ee \uf8f0\u02c6Ai \u00b7 si(\u03b8) \u00b7 |yi| X t=1 \u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t| . . . ) \uf8f9 \uf8fb (8) By applying a single, holistic correction factor to the entire trajectory, DSPO avoids the accumulation of token-level noise that plagues prior methods, leading to fundamentally more stable training. In parallel, the dynamic filtering mechanism guarantees a normal advantage signal \u02c6Ai by constructing training batches from rollout groups that contain both successes and failures, thus preventing wasted samples in sparse-reward environments. 3.2.2 DYNAMIC OUTCOME-BASED FILTERING FOR EFFICIENT LEARNING The sparse binary nature of our reward function poses a challenge for group-based advantage estimation. If all G responses in a group are correct (R = 1) or all are incorrect (R = 0), the normalized advantage \u02c6Ai becomes zero or undefined. Such batches do not provide a useful gradient signal, wasting computational resources. To overcome this, DSPO incorporates a dynamic filtering mechanism inspired by DAPO (Yu et al., 2025). During sampling, we only retain groups of trajectories that contain a mix of successful and unsuccessful outcomes. A group {yi}G i=1 is used for training only if its rewards {Ri}G i=1 satisfy: 0 < G X i=1 Ri < G. (9) This ensures that the reward variance within every training group is non-zero, guaranteeing a meaningful advantage signal. This dynamic selection curates a high-quality dataset for each policy update, transforming a sparse reward problem into a dense and efficient learning signal. 3.3 THE DSPO OBJECTIVE AND TRAINING ALGORITHM By integrating these components, we arrive at the final DSPO objective. For each valid group from the filtered sample space Dfiltered, we compute the advantage \u02c6Ai using group-relative normalization: \u02c6Ai = Ri \u2212mean(R) std(R) + \u03b4 , (10) where \u03b4 is a small constant for numerical stability. The policy \u03c0\u03b8 is updated by maximizing: JDSPO(\u03b8) = E(x,{yi})\u2208Dfiltered \" 1 G G X i=1 min \u0010 si(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai, clip(si(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6Ai \u0011# , (11) where si is", "= Ri \u2212mean(R) std(R) + \u03b4 , (10) where \u03b4 is a small constant for numerical stability. The policy \u03c0\u03b8 is updated by maximizing: JDSPO(\u03b8) = E(x,{yi})\u2208Dfiltered \" 1 G G X i=1 min \u0010 si(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai, clip(si(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6Ai \u0011# , (11) where si is the sequence-level importance ration defined as the geometric mean of the token-level ratios. Crucially, during likelihood calculation, we apply loss masking to all tokens retrieved from the search tool following Jin et al. (2025b). This ensures the model learns to utilize external knowledge for reasoning, not simply to reproduce it. The full training process is detailed in Algorithm 1. 4 EXPERIMENTS In this section, we conduct a series of experiments to empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed Dynamic- filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO) algorithm. Our primary objectives are to demonstrate that DSPO: (1) achieves exceptional performance on challenging question-answering benchmarks; (2) exhibits significantly en- hanced training stability, avoiding the catastrophic collapse that plagues baseline methods; and (3) derives its perfor- mance gains from the synergistic combination of its core components. 5 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning Algorithm 1 Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO) 1: Input: Initial policy \u03c0\u03b80, fixed reference policy \u03c0ref, prompt dataset D, group size G, batch size B, search tool R. 2: Initialize policy \u03c0\u03b8 \u2190\u03c0\u03b80. 3: for each training step do 4: \u03c0\u03b8old \u2190\u03c0\u03b8. 5: Initialize training buffer B \u2190\u2205. 6: while |B| < B do 7: Sample a prompt x \u223cD. 8: Generate a group of G trajectories {yi}G i=1 using \u03c0\u03b8old and the search tool R. 9: Compute terminal rewards {Ri}G i=1 = {ContainsAnswer(yi, ygold)}G i=1. 10: if 0 < PG i=1 Ri < G then \u25b7Dynamic outcome-based filtering 11: Add (x, {yi}G i=1, {Ri}G i=1) to B. 12: end if 13: end while 14: for each (x, {yi}, {Ri}) in B do 15: Compute advantages { \u02c6Ai}G i=1 via group normalization of {Ri}. 16: Compute sequence-level importance ratios {si(\u03b8)}G i=1 using Eq. 6. 17: Compute the DSPO loss for the group using Eq. 11, applying masks to retrieved tokens. 18: end for 19: Update policy parameters \u03b8 by taking a gradient step on the total loss from B. 20: end for 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 Accuracy 0.270 Musique 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 Accuracy 0.432 Bamboogle 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 Accuracy 0.580 Natural Questions 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 Accuracy 0.569 2wiki 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.600 0.625 0.650 0.675 0.700 0.725 0.750 0.775 0.800 Accuracy 0.754 TriviaQA 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 Accuracy 0.613 HotpotQA 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 Accuracy 0.498 PopQA Figure 2: Validation performance of DSPO across seven benchmarks during training.

To provide a rigorous evaluation, our experimental design adheres to the established protocol of Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025b). We train our model on a composite dataset containing the training splits of Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). We then assess its generaliza- tion capabilities on the test sets of seven diverse QA benchmarks: NQ, TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022), HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2022). Our comparison suite includes strong external baselines and critical internal ablations. External baselines are the Qwen2.5-7B and 14B models trained with PPO and GRPO from the Search-R1 framework (Jin et al., 2025b;a). To deconstruct our method, we also include two internal baselines as ablations: (1) DSPO w/o dynamic filter, which is 6 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning 0 50 100 150 200 Training Steps 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 Reward DSPO w/o Seq-level Opt.

For implementation, we used Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model as the starting checkpoint for all our training. Our experiments are built upon the VeRL framework (Sheng et al., 2025), for which we adapted the provided search-r1-like example code and scripts to suit our methodology. We benchmark DSPO against a comprehen- sive suite of baselines. For external comparison, we use the PPO and GRPO methods from the Search-R1 framework (Jin et al., 2025b;a). Crucially, as our work utilizes a modified reward function, we retrained these models under our exact experimental conditions to ensure a fair comparison. The results of these retrained models serve as our primary external benchmarks. Implementation and Evaluation. To isolate the benefits of our algorithm, all RL experiments deliberately employ a standard BM25 retriever. This controlled setup ensures that observed performance improvements are directly at- tributable to the model\u2019s learned policy. Across all methods, models are trained using a sparse, binary reward signal based on substring Exact Match (subEM) of the final answer, and subEM serves as the primary evaluation metric. 4.2 MAIN RESULTS AND ABLATION STUDY To provide a holistic view of our algorithm\u2019s effectiveness, we present a comprehensive comparison in Table 1. Due to the synergistic nature of DSPO\u2019s components, we find it", "substring Exact Match (subEM) of the final answer, and subEM serves as the primary evaluation metric. 4.2 MAIN RESULTS AND ABLATION STUDY To provide a holistic view of our algorithm\u2019s effectiveness, we present a comprehensive comparison in Table 1. Due to the synergistic nature of DSPO\u2019s components, we find it most illustrative to present our main results alongside our ablation study. This single table juxtaposes DSPO against both external state-of-the-art baselines and its own ablated variants, offering a clear and direct assessment of its overall superiority and the indispensability of its core components. Comparison with Baselines. The results in Table 1 underscore DSPO\u2019s clear superiority. Our DSPO-trained 7B agent achieves a remarkable average score of 0.531, establishing a new state-of-the-art. This represents a 34.1% relative improvement over the same-sized Search-R1 (GRPO, 7B) model. More strikingly, our 7B agent achieves a slightly better average score than the much larger Search-R1 14B models (both GRPO and PPO). This outcome provides strong evidence that the performance gains stem from a more effective and stable learning algorithm rather than an over-reliance on model scale. Analysis of Ablations. The ablation results, also presented in Table 1, unequivocally demonstrate that both of DSPO\u2019s components are indispensable. First, removing the dynamic filter (\u2018w/o dynamic filter\u2018) causes a catastrophic drop in performance, with the average score plummeting to 0.313. This highlights its critical role; without the fil- 7 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning Table 1: Comprehensive comparison of DSPO with baselines and ablation variants on seven QA benchmarks.

While this token-level variant outperforms the filter-less one, it falls well short of the full DSPO model. As we show in the next section, it is also prone to catastrophic training instability.

As we show in the next section, it is also prone to catastrophic training instability. This confirms that the synergy is crucial: sequence-level updates are essential for stability, while our dynamic filter is critical for transforming sparse rewards into an efficient learning signal. Beyond quantitative metrics, we observe that DSPO enables sophisticated search behaviors, including recognize irrel- evant results, query reformulation and multi-turn verification (see Appendix A for detailed trajectory examples). All of these behaviors are emerging from pure RL training through DSPO. 4.3 ANALYSIS OF TRAINING DYNAMICS To empirically validate our claims regarding stability and efficiency, we analyze the training reward dynamics of DSPO, its ablations, and key baselines. Figure 3 offers a compelling visualization of these dynamics, reinforcing our core architectural choices. DSPO (red) exhibits a smooth, monotonic ascent, efficiently converging to the highest reward level. This trajectory empirically confirms the stability afforded by its sequence-level objective. In stark contrast, the token-level meth- ods\u2014DSPO w/o Seq-level Opt. (green) and vanilla GRPO (blue)\u2014suffer from catastrophic policy collapse early in training. Their rewards plummet after a brief initial improvement, a clear manifestation of the instability caused by high-variance, token-level gradient updates. Meanwhile, DSPO w/o Dynamic Filter (purple), which leverages sequence-level updates but lacks an efficient learning signal, remains stable but plateaus at a significantly suboptimal performance ceiling. These dynamics reveal that DSPO\u2019s synergy of sequence-level stability and dynamic filtering is key to its robust and effective policy optimization. To ensure these improvements in training reward translate to genuine generalization rather than reward hacking, we track validation performance on key benchmarks throughout training. As illustrated in Figure 2, DSPO\u2019s validation accuracy on NQ, HotpotQA, and other diverse benchmarks rises consistently, mirroring its stable reward curve. This correlation confirms that the agent is learning a generalizable search-and-reasoning policy. 5 CONCLUSION In this work, we tackled the critical instability and sample inefficiency issues that plague RL for autonomous LLM search agents. We introduced Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO), an improved algorithm that ensures robust training through two key components: sequence-level optimization to prevent catastrophic policy collapse, and a dynamic outcome-based filter to transform sparse rewards into a consistently effective learning signal. 8 DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning Our experiments demonstrated that DSPO not only achieves substantial performance across a suite of challenging question-answering benchmarks but also exhibits superior training stability compared to prior methods. By enabling robust training from environmental feedback alone, DSPO establishes a practical and efficient blueprint for creating capable LLM agents without costly expert data. With this stable foundation, future work can confidently explore integrating advanced retrievers or extending DSPO to complex, multi-tool tasks. Furthermore, since the chal- lenges of sparse rewards and unstable policy gradients are not unique to search, we hypothesize that DSPO\u2019s principles will yield similar performance and stability gains in other domains such as mathematics and code generation, which remains a promising direction for future validation.

DETECTING DATA CONTAMINATION FROM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING POST-TRAINING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS Yongding Tao1 Tian Wang1 Yihong Dong1 Huanyu Liu1 Kechi Zhang1 Xiaolong Hu2 Ge Li1 1 School of Computer Science, Peking University 2 New H3C Technologies Co., Ltd ydtao25@stu.pku.edu.cn lige@pku.edu.cn ABSTRACT Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may in- advertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported perfor- mance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post- training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of special- ized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vul- nerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detec- tion within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribu- tion of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self- Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model\u2019s convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simu- late this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self- Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/yongding-tao/RL-Data-Contamination. 1 INTRODUCTION The reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) evaluations is seriously threatened by data contam- ination. This happens when benchmark test samples accidentally get included in the training data, which can invalidate the model\u2019s reported performance. To solve this problem, many researchers have developed detection methods, but they have almost exclusively focused on the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (Dong et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Xie et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025a;b) stages. However, these efforts have left a major gap: the increasingly important phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. We believe this is a critical oversight, because powerful techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Re- wards (RLVR) (Shao et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025) are now essential for improving LLM reasoning. This makes the RL stage a major potential source of contamination that has been largely overlooked. The challenge of detecting RL-phase contamination stems from a fundamental shift in the training objective, rendering existing methods ineffective. Both pre-training and SFT are likelihood-based paradigms; they train models to maximize the probability of observed data. This process naturally creates strong, likelihood-based signals, such as unusually low perplexity, which most current de- tectors are built to identify. By contrast, RL, especially RLVR, operates on a reward-maximization principle. The policy is not trained to mimic a ground-truth distribution but is instead guided by 1 arXiv:2510.09259v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint. 0", "strong, likelihood-based signals, such as unusually low perplexity, which most current de- tectors are built to identify.

(c) Our method achieves a significantly higher AUC while existing baselines perform close to random guess. sparse reward signals to find a successful reasoning path. This approach often enables stronger gen- eralization than SFT (Kirk et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2025), but by decoupling from likelihood-based objectives, it also erases the very signals that traditional detectors rely on. Consequently, RL-phase contamination becomes a uniquely challenging problem, creating an urgent need for a new class of detection methods specifically designed for this reward-driven setting. Given that likelihood-based signals are ineffective, our search for a new detection method begins with identifying a signal inherent to the reward-driven training process. Recent studies on RL\u2019s training dynamics point to a promising candidate: the phenomenon of policy collapse. Specifi- cally, RL narrows the search space to improve pass@1 accuracy, often at the cost of lower pass@k performance (Havrilla et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024b; Yue et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025), and produces distinctive entropy patterns, such as high-entropy concentration on certain tokens (Wang et al., 2025a; Cheng et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025). These findings suggest that entropy could serve as a powerful indicator of this collapse and its associated path dependency. However, our initial in- vestigations revealed that using entropy directly as a contamination signal is unreliable. The reason is that policy collapse is a general behavior of RL and can occur even on clean samples not seen during training. As shown in Figures 1a and 1b, both contaminated and clean samples can exhibit sparse token-level entropy. This implies that a simple passive check is insufficient. Therefore, we introduce an active probing mechanism to expose the underlying differences. We find that when the model is asked to generate an alternative reasoning path given its initial response (self-critique), contaminated samples struggle to deviate, resulting in highly similar entropy curves (Figure 1a). In contrast, the model shows greater flexibility on clean samples, leading to more distinct entropy patterns (Figure 1b).1 Building on these observations, we introduce Self-Critique, an entropy-based detection method that applies our self-critique probing strategy. The core", "contaminated samples struggle to deviate, resulting in highly similar entropy curves (Figure 1a). In contrast, the model shows greater flexibility on clean samples, leading to more distinct entropy patterns (Figure 1b).1 Building on these observations, we introduce Self-Critique, an entropy-based detection method that applies our self-critique probing strategy. The core idea is to instruct the model to generate two distinct responses for the same problem; samples where the two responses exhibit high similarity in their entropy space are flagged as contaminated. A detailed workflow is shown in Figure 2. However, rigorously evaluating this method is challenging, as no existing benchmark can isolate and simulate contamination purely within the RL phase. To overcome this hurdle, we also developed RL-MIA (Reinforcement Learning Membership Inference Attack), a new benchmark constructed for this specific purpose. Using RL-MIA across challenging math and logic datasets, we show that Self-Critique is highly effective. As previewed in Figure 1c, our method significantly outperforms existing detectors, which operate near the level of random guess. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: \u2776To the best of our knowledge, we present the first systematic study of data contamination detection in the RL post-training phase of LLMs, highlighting a critical yet overlooked problem. \u2777We propose Self-Critique, an entropy-based detector that measures RL-induced policy collapse via self-critique probing.

Data Contamination Detection Data contamination detection can be regarded as a specific in- stance of membership inference attacks (MIA), which were initially introduced to measure mem- orization and privacy risks (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2019; Mireshghallah et al., 2022a). Recently, the issue of data contamination in LLMs has drawn increasing attention, as it directly undermines the validity of benchmark evaluations (Sainz et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024a;b; Wu et al., 2025). Prior work on data contamination detection in LLMs has mainly focused on the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages (Mireshghallah et al., 2022b; Fu et al., 2023; Mattern et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024b; Gonen et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b). In these stages, models largely rely on memorizing training data for learning (Zeng et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b), a process that naturally creates strong, likelihood-based signals\u2014such as unusually low perplexity\u2014that most current detectors are built to identify. In contrast, during the RL post-training phase, LLMs are optimized to autonomously explore reasoning trajectories. This reward-driven objective decouples the model\u2019s behavior from simple likelihood metrics, posing a unique challenge for conventional detection methods.

In contrast, during the RL post-training phase, LLMs are optimized to autonomously explore reasoning trajectories. This reward-driven objective decouples the model\u2019s behavior from simple likelihood metrics, posing a unique challenge for conventional detection methods. Entropy in Reinforcement Learning Post-training Reinforcement learning has become a crucial paradigm for post-training large language models. Leveraging reinforcement learning with verifi- able rewards substantially enhances LLM\u2019s reasoning capabilities (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). A key factor in RL post-training is entropy: high entropy promotes exploration via stochastic policies, while low entropy favors exploitation through deterministic behavior. A common challenge in RL post-training is entropy collapse (Cui et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025), where policy entropy de- creases dramatically in the early stages of training, leading to premature convergence and restricted exploration. To address this, entropy management strategies regularize entropy to prevent rapid col- lapse (O\u2019Donoghue et al., 2016; He et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c) or use high-entropy signals to encourage inherently exploratory reasoning behaviors (Cheng et al., 2025; Vanlioglu, 2025; Tan & Pan, 2025), thus maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. In reasoning tasks, high-entropy tokens indicate uncertain decision points and are assigned stronger RL updates, while low-entropy tokens, which correspond to more deterministic outputs, receive smaller updates (Li et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Tang et al., 2025). As a result, the trained model develops distinct entropy patterns across tokens. In this work, we analyze these entropy patterns before and after self-critique to detect potential data contamination. 3 THE CHALLENGE OF CONTAMINATION DETECTION IN RL In this section, we formalize the problem of detecting data contamination in the RL post-training phase of LLMs, and then highlight why detection methods based on likelihood, which are effective in pre-training and SFT, become unreliable in RL. Finally, we introduce token-level entropy as a lens to analyze RL-induced policy collapse, which lays the foundation for our proposed method. 3.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION We consider the task of detecting data contamination in the RL post-training phase of Large Lan- guage Models. Formally, this can be framed as a Membership Inference Attack(MIA) problem: given a model M that has undergone RL post-training and a sample x, the goal is to determine whether x was included in the RL training dataset DRL. A detector is a function f(M, x) \u2192{0, 1}, where 1 indicates membership (contamination) and 0 indicates non-membership. We focus on the black-box setting (Shi et al., 2024), where the detector can only query M for outputs, without access to internal states, gradients, or training data. 3 Preprint. 3.2 WHY RL POST-TRAINING IS A UNIQUE CASE Existing data detection methods are largely designed for training paradigms whose objectives are rooted in Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). However, the objective of RL post-training is fundamentally different, which introduces unique and significant challenges for detection. Both pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning are governed by an MLE-based objective. Their goal is to train a model M with parameters \u03b8 to maximize the likelihood of the observed data by minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss. For pre-training, the model learns", "different, which introduces unique and significant challenges for detection. Both pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning are governed by an MLE-based objective. Their goal is to train a model M with parameters \u03b8 to maximize the likelihood of the observed data by minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss. For pre-training, the model learns from a vast corpus of unlabeled text Dpretrain. The objective is next-token prediction, aiming to learn a general distribution of the language. For a text sequence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ), the loss is: LPretrain(\u03b8) = \u2212 X x\u2208Dpretrain T X t=1 log p\u03b8(xt|x<t) (1) For SFT, the model learns from a dataset of prompt-response pairs DSFT = {(q, r)}. The objective is to learn to follow instructions and generate helpful responses. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target response r = (r1, . . . , rK) given the prompt q: LSFT(\u03b8) = \u2212 X (q,r)\u2208DSFT K X t=1 log p\u03b8(rt|q, r<t) (2) Despite their different data sources, both paradigms (Eq. 1 and 2) share the same underlying princi- ple: they directly train the model to assign high probabilities to sequences seen in the training data. This provides a clear signal for detection methods like Perplexity (Gonen et al., 2023) and Min-K% Prob (Shi et al., 2024), which are built upon this likelihood principle. In stark contrast, RL post-training (and specifically RLVR) does not directly optimize for likeli- hood. Its objective is to update the policy \u03c0\u03b8 to maximize the expected reward R from a set of generated outputs {oi} given a prompt q. The objective for a method like GRPO (Shao et al., 2024a) can be abstracted as: JRL(\u03b8) = Eq\u223cDRL,{oi}\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old [f(R(oi), \u03c0\u03b8)] , (3) where f(\u00b7) is a function of the reward, the current policy, and a reference policy. The key distinction is that the optimization is driven by an external, often sparse, reward signal R(oi) (e.g., 1 for a cor- rect final answer, 0 otherwise), not by the token-level log-probabilities of the ground-truth response. This decouples the model\u2019s final behavior from simple likelihood metrics, rendering many existing detection approaches that rely on this signal ineffective. 3.3 ENTROPY AS A NEW SIGNAL FOR RL DETECTION Recent studies (Yue et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Cui et al., 2025) have shown that RL post- training frequently leads to policy collapse: for samples that receive consistent reward, the model converges to a narrow reasoning path, producing overly stable outputs. This phenomenon is reflected in the token-level entropy. For each decoding step t, the token-level entropy is Ht = \u2212 X v\u2208V p\u03b8(v | x<t) log p\u03b8(v | x<t), (4) and the entropy sequence E = {Ht}T t=1 measures uncertainty along the generated trajectory. Empirical observations show that RL tends to push entropy sequences into sparse patterns, where many tokens are nearly deterministic. Crucially, this collapse is stronger for contaminated samples that were explicitly rewarded during RL training, whereas clean samples retain more variability when probed. These insights suggest that contamination detection in RL requires moving beyond likelihood and in- stead measuring", "entropy sequences into sparse patterns, where many tokens are nearly deterministic. Crucially, this collapse is stronger for contaminated samples that were explicitly rewarded during RL training, whereas clean samples retain more variability when probed. These insights suggest that contamination detection in RL requires moving beyond likelihood and in- stead measuring the policy\u2019s dependence on specific reasoning paths. Token-level entropy provides a natural signal for this purpose, which directly motivates our Self-Critique method: by asking the model to regenerate an alternative reasoning path conditioned on its initial response and comparing the entropy sequences, we can reveal whether a sample was memorized during RL training. 4 Preprint. 4 DETECTION VIA SELF-CRITIQUE Initial Thinking Membership Self-Critique Probing Probelm \uff0b Initial Thinking Critique Thinking Critique Thinking Figure 2: Overview of the Self-Critique detection workflow.

Our method is motivated by the hypothesis that RL post-training induces high-reward path depen- dence for contaminated samples. Concretely, for a problem q seen during RL training, the policy \u03c0\u03b8 tends to converge to a highly rewarded and thus similar response trajectory. In contrast, for problems not seen during RL training, the model is more likely to produce an alternative reasoning path when prompted. The Self-Critique method quantifies this dependency. We first elicit the model\u2019s most confident (deterministic) response, and then ask the model to produce a different solution conditioned on the initial response. We compare the token-level entropy sequences of the two generations to measure the degree of path dependence. An overview is shown in Figure 2. 4.1 THE SELF-CRITIQUE DETECTION PROCESS Let M be a large language model with parameters \u03b8, and let q be the problem under test. We use a deterministic decoding strategy (e.g., greedy decoding) to obtain the model\u2019s most confident response as the reference. Step 1: Initial response. We construct the initial prompt P1 by embedding q into a chat template T, and obtain the model\u2019s response: r1 = M(T(q)). (5) We then compute the token-level entropy sequence for this response, E1 = {Ht(r1)}|r1| t=1, which serves as the baseline reasoning trajectory. Step 2: Self-critique response. We form a self-critique prompt P2 by augmenting q with an in- structional meta-prompt Icritique2 and the text of r1: q\u2032 = q \u2295Icritique(r1), (6) where \u2295denotes appending to the user content within the prompt structure. We then generate the second response and its entropy sequence: r2 = M(T(q\u2032)), E2 = {Ht(r2)}|r2| t=1. (7) Step 3: Similarity score. The contamination score is the similarity between the two entropy se- quences. A higher similarity indicates that the model remains on the same reasoning path despite being instructed to change it, suggesting memorization. We use a length-aware (penalized) cosine similarity: ScoreSelf-Critique(q) = cospenalized(E1, E2), (8) where cospenalized(A, B) = cos \u0000pad(A), pad(B) \u0001 \u00d7 min(|A|, |B|) max(|A|, |B|). (9) 2The exact Icritique is shown in Appendix E. 5 Preprint. Here cos(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the standard cosine similarity between vectors (dot product over", "memorization. We use a length-aware (penalized) cosine similarity: ScoreSelf-Critique(q) = cospenalized(E1, E2), (8) where cospenalized(A, B) = cos \u0000pad(A), pad(B) \u0001 \u00d7 min(|A|, |B|) max(|A|, |B|). (9) 2The exact Icritique is shown in Appendix E. 5 Preprint. Here cos(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the standard cosine similarity between vectors (dot product over the product of L2 norms), and pad(\u00b7) zero-pads the shorter sequence to the maximum length so that non-overlapping positions contribute zero. The multiplicative length ratio penalizes cases where one response is much shorter/longer than the other, since response length itself reflects a facet of the reasoning mode. Overall, a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of contamination. A formal description of the procedure is provided in Appendix A. 5 EXPERIMENTS In this section, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our proposed Self-Critique. We first introduce the RL-MIA benchmark, which we constructed specifically for RL data contamination detection. We then describe the baseline methods we compare against and detail our experimental setup. Finally, we present the main results, followed by analysis and ablation studies. Additional experimental results are in Appendix B and C. 5.1 RL-MIA: A BENCHMARK FOR RL MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE ATTACK To the best of our knowledge, no benchmark currently exists for systematically detecting data con- tamination during the RL post-training stage. To address this gap, we introduce the RL-MIA (Re- inforcement Learning Membership Inference Attack). The key idea behind RL-MIA is to simulate controllable data contamination by selectively including a subset of data in the RL post-training pro- cess, while the objective of the contamination detection task is to identify which samples have been used. The problems used for this simulation are drawn from four benchmarks selected to cover diverse styles and potential pre-training exposure. We include the widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks, i.e., AIME 2024 and AIME 2025. AIME 2024 may have appeared in some models\u2019 pre-training corpora, allowing us to test robustness to prior exposure, whereas AIME 2025 is post- cutoff and thus unlikely to be present in pre-training data. To obtain a controlled setting free from prior exposure, we also include two synthetically generated logical reasoning datasets: Knights & Knaves (K&K) (Xie et al., 2024a) and SAT (Liu et al., 2025). The synthetic nature of these datasets ensures that any detected training signal can be attributed to the RL post-training phase. To approximate a realistic setting, we embed the selected benchmarks into a larger RL post-training corpus. For AIME24 and AIME25, we use the widely adopted OpenR1-Math-46K (Guha et al., 2025) corpus as the base and inject 50% of each benchmark\u2019s items into the RL training data. For K&K and SAT, following their original papers , we use the provided training portions to form the contaminated split and synthesize additional items as held-out clean samples. We primarily use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) and DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct (Shao et al., 2024b) as the model for simulating RL-stage contamination. We also run experiments on Qwen2.5-0.5B- Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) and Qwen2.5-7B-Math (Yang et al., 2024).

All RL runs are implemented with VeRL (Sheng et al., 2025) framework on 8 \u00d7 NVIDIA A100 (40 GB). Detailed dataset splits and training settings are provided in Appendix F. 5.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Baseline Methods We compare Self-Critique against a set of representative baselines. A key con- sideration in the RL post-training setting is that training changes the response distribution rather than the likelihood of the prompt. Therefore, for baselines originally designed for pre-training data detection (which operate on input text), we adapt them to operate on the model\u2019s responses to ensure a fair comparison. The baselines include: \u2776Perplexity (PPL) (Gonen et al., 2023), which assumes memorized text has lower perplexity; \u2777Min-K% Prob (Shi et al., 2024), which posits that memo- rized text is less likely to contain low-probability outlier tokens; and \u2778Min-K%++ (Zhang et al., 2025b), which normalizes token probabilities for a more robust score. We also include \u2779Recall (Xie et al., 2024b), which prefixes the text with non-member content and measures the relative change in log-likelihood, and \u277aCDD (Dong et al., 2024), which measures output consistency under stochastic sampling via the average token-level edit distance across multiple generations. 6 Preprint. We summarize these baselines in Table 1: PPL, Min-K%, and Min-K%++ directly use log- probability properties of the text; Recall and CDD expose differences by injecting a non-member prefix or by randomly sampling multiple outputs, respectively. In contrast, we propose a new probing mechanism, i.e., self-critique probing, and use entropy as the core signal for RL-stage contami- nation detection. Following the probing ideas in CDD and Recall, we also introduce two additional entropy-based baselines, \u277bEntropy-Temp and \u277cEntropy-Noise, which keep the probing mecha- nisms but replace the consistency/likelihood metric with entropy.

AUC is threshold-independent and reflects the probability that the detector ranks a randomly chosen contaminated sample higher than a randomly chosen clean one; higher AUC indicates stronger detection performance (50% corresponds to random guess). We also report the F1 score at the Youden threshold (Fluss et al., 2005) as a threshold-specific reference. 5.3", "and reflects the probability that the detector ranks a randomly chosen contaminated sample higher than a randomly chosen clean one; higher AUC indicates stronger detection performance (50% corresponds to random guess).

The main results of different data contamination methods based on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct3 are shown in Table 2. Across both models, Self-Critique is the most reliable detector: it attains the best average AUC on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (0.70, +19% over the best non-ours baseline) and on DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct (0.64, also +19% improvement), and it leads on most per-dataset AUCs. In contrast, likelihood-based baselines (PPL, Min-K%, Min- K%++) often perform near random guesses and can be unstable. Among existing methods, Recall achieves relatively strong performance (it is also a state-of-the-art approach for pre-training contam- ination (Xie et al., 2024b)), suggesting that probing to expose membership signals is more effective than relying solely on intrinsic text properties. Moreover, when using the same probing mechanisms, the entropy-based variants perform better (Entropy-Temp vs. CDD; Entropy-Noise vs. Recall), indi- cating that entropy is a sensitive indicator of RL-induced changes and thus better suited for RL-stage detection. Finally, compared to random sampling or prefix injection, our self-critique probing aligns more closely with the RL property of dependence on high-reward paths. Within our entropy-based meth- ods, this leads to notable gains, i.e., +13% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +16% on DeepSeek-Math- 7B-Instruct. 5.4 DUAL-STAGE CONTAMINATION IN PRE-TRAINING & RL To isolate the effects of", "sampling or prefix injection, our self-critique probing aligns more closely with the RL property of dependence on high-reward paths. Within our entropy-based meth- ods, this leads to notable gains, i.e., +13% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +16% on DeepSeek-Math- 7B-Instruct. 5.4 DUAL-STAGE CONTAMINATION IN PRE-TRAINING & RL To isolate the effects of RL-phase contamination, our previous experiments were primarily con- ducted on synthetic data or datasets with low levels of contamination. However, for public bench- marks released before an LLM\u2019s training cutoff, contamination from both pretraining and the RL phase can co-occur. Therefore, we design a study to distinguish between these two sources of contamination. Concretely, we choose GSM8K (widely acknowledged to suffer from substantial pretraining leakage (Zhang et al., 2024a; Dekoninck et al., 2024; Mirzadeh et al., 2025)) and train Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with the PPO algorithm.4 We then simulate RL-phase contamination by injecting half of the test set into the RL training data. As discussed in Section 3.2, pretraining (which optimizes via Maximum Likelihood Estimation) and RL (which uses reward-driven policy optimization) pursue different objectives, so their respective forms of contamination are likely to produce distinct effects. 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.6 0.3 0.1 Pretraining contamination rate (higher lower) 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 AUC +55% 0.88 Self-Critique (lower pretraining contamination) Self-Critique (random subset) PPL Random guess (AUC = 0.50) Figure 3: Dual-stage contamination analysis. Self- Critique on the lower-pretraining-contamination sub- set (green) improves sharply as the rate decreases. We first assign each test item a pretraining- contamination proxy score using a likelihood-based detector (e.g., PPL) to separate these effects. We then evaluate RL-stage contamination detection under two conditions: \u2776a lower-pretraining- contamination subset, created by select- ing the bottom-q quantile of items by PPL score (e.g., the lowest 50%); and \u2777 a random-control subset. To control for any confounding effects from a smaller sample size on AUC, the random-control subset is formed by uniformly sampling the same number of items, thereby match- ing the subset size while preserving the original data distribution. Our hypothesis predicts that Self-Critique\u2019s performance will significantly improve on the former subset, but not on the latter. The results are shown in Figure 3, and we also provide the numerical results in Table 6 of Appendix B. As the pretraining contamination level decreases, the performance of Self-Critique on the lower- pretraining-contamination subset improves significantly. In contrast, its performance on the random- control subset shows a slight decrease, while the PPL-based detector\u2019s performance approaches that of a random guess. This outcome rules out a pure sample-size effect (as performance on the random- 3We also provide additional results on Qwen2.5-7B-Math in Appendix B. 4Actually, the setting is the same as the quick start in verl, which makes it easy to reproduce the results. 8 Preprint. control subset does not improve) and supports our hypothesis: conditioning the RL detector on items with a weaker pretraining signal allows it to identify RL-phase memorization or path dependence far more clearly. Meanwhile, the fact that likelihood-based cues (PPL) remain unstable and close to 0.5 further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in specifically targeting RL-phase data contamination.", "hypothesis: conditioning the RL detector on items with a weaker pretraining signal allows it to identify RL-phase memorization or path dependence far more clearly.

Across all algorithms, Self-Critique is the most reliable detector: it attains the best AUC for each algorithm and the highest average AUC (0.60). Entropy-based probes are consistently stronger than likelihood-based methods: Entropy- Temp is the next best on average (0.58), while likelihood baselines (PPL, Min-K%, Min-K%++) are around 0.46\u20130.51. These trends suggest that our probe, measuring path dependence via entropy sim- ilarity, captures an RL-induced rigidity signal that is algorithm-agnostic. F1 scores follow the same pattern, further indicating that Self-Critique yields both better ranking (AUC) and better thresholded decisions. Ablation on Top-K Entropy Approximation As LLM vocabularies are large, it is often imprac- tical to obtain the full next-token distribution at every decoding step to compute exact entropy. In many APIs, only Top-K token probabilities are available, so we approximate entropy using those Top-K masses. We conduct an ablation on the choice of K (Table 4). Reducing K does not harm performance; even in the extreme case K = 3, the AUC drops only slightly. We attribute this to the long-tailed nature of next-token distributions: most probability mass concentrates on a small set of tokens, and the tail contributes little to entropy. Hence, Top-K entropy is both efficient and accurate enough for our detector. Table 4: Ablation on Top-K entropy approximation (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct).

To address this gap, we proposed Self-Critique, a novel method that identifies RL-induced policy collapse by actively probing the model\u2019s reasoning path dependen- cies using token-level entropy. To validate our method in a controlled setting, we also developed RL-MIA, a new benchmark for RL-phase contamination. Experiments show that Self-Critique con- sistently outperforms baselines, improving the average AUC by up to 30%, and its ability to isolate RL-specific signals is further highlighted in dual-contamination scenarios, where performance im- proves by up to 55%. As the community\u2019s understanding of RL post-training grows, we expect that more detectors tailored to this unique setting will emerge. ETHICS STATEMENT All authors have read and adhered to the ICLR Code of Ethics. The primary objective of our work is to enhance the integrity and reliability of Large Language Model evaluations. We address this by developing Self-Critique, a method to detect data contamination in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training phase, aiming to prevent misleading performance claims and promote transparent research practices. Our method is a specific application of Membership Inference Attack (MIA) techniques, and we acknowledge the potential dual-use concerns regarding data privacy. However, our study is carefully scoped to mitigate these risks. The goal of our work is defensive, i.e., providing a validation tool for researchers, and it is applied exclusively to public, non-sensitive benchmarks (AIME, K&K, SAT, GSM8K) that contain no personal data. We believe the societal benefit of ensuring robust and honest model evaluation significantly outweighs the minimal risk of misuse in this context. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We are committed to ensuring the full reproducibility of our research. To facilitate this, we have made our code and the newly constructed RL-MIA benchmark available at https://github. com/yongding-tao/RL-Data-Contamination. This repository includes the implemen- tation of our proposed Self-Critique method, baseline methods, and scripts to run the experiments. A formal, step-by-step description of the Self-Critique algorithm is provided in Appendix A (Al- gorithm 1). The specific prompts used for the self-critique probing mechanism are detailed in Ap- pendix E. Details regarding the construction of the RL-MIA benchmark, including dataset sources, injection methods, and data splits, are described in Section 5.1 and further elaborated in Appendix F (Table 7). The key training hyperparameters for all RL models and algorithms are provided in Ap- pendix F (Table 8), ensuring that our training process can be accurately replicated.

B ADDITIONAL RESULTS B.1 ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON QWEN2.5-7B-MATH As shown in Table 5, on Qwen2.5-7B-Math, Self-Critique achieves the best AUC on both AIME24 (0.76) and AIME25 (0.72), and the highest average AUC (0.74). The two entropy baselines are com- petitive, while likelihood-based methods (PPL, Min-K%, Min-K%++) and Recall/CDD are clearly weaker here. We do not report K&K and SAT for this model because we could not get stable RL training on these synthetic datasets with a non-instruct base; such setups typically require more careful RL hyperparameters and data curation. This engineering detail is outside the scope of our study. Table 5: Detection results on Qwen2.5-7B-Math under RL-MIA (higher is better). AVG reports mean AUC across AIME24 and AIME25.

As our self-critique idea asks the model to propose an alternative reasoning path given its initial response, a naive variant is to skip the initial response and simply tell the model to \u201canswer us- ing an unusual technique\u201d5. The results in Figure 4 show that without the initial response as an anchor, performance collapses to near random guess . This variant fails because it removes the an- chor that makes the probe meaningful: without conditioning on the initial answer, the \u201calternative\u201d path is unconstrained, instruction following is noisy, and both members and non-members produce heterogeneous trajectories whose entropy sequences are not comparable. Moreover, RL can induce mode-seeking even on unseen items, so we end up measuring two arbitrary paths rather than the deviation from a memorized one. Self-critique fixes a concrete baseline and probes deviation from it\u2014hence the large AUC gains over the no-response variant. C.2 ABLATION ON SAMPLING STRATEGY We perform an ablation study of the sampling strategies used to generate model responses. Specifi- cally, we experiment with three settings: (1) using greedy sampling for both the initial response and the second self-critique response; (2) using greedy sampling for the initial response and tempera- ture sampling for the self-critique response; and (3) using temperature sampling for both the initial response and the self-critique response. For temperature sampling, we test multiple temperatures. The ablation results, shown in Figure 5, indicate that the best performance is achieved when both the initial and self-critique responses are generated by greedy sampling. This is because greedy sampling eliminates the effect of randomness, thereby better revealing the sharp policy distributions caused by entropy collapse from RL post-training.

To create a controlled environment for evaluating data contamination in the RL phase, we con- structed the RL-MIA benchmark. The methodology involves injecting a known subset of test sam- ples (contaminated items) into a larger base corpus for RL post-training. The detection task is then to distinguish these injected samples from clean, unseen samples. Table 7 summarizes the data splits for each source dataset, detailing the size of the base RL corpus, the number of injected items, the to- tal size of the final training set, the number of times each contaminated item appears (Occurrences), and the total number of items in the final detection task (Contaminated + Clean). For reproducibility, we also provide the key hyperparameters used during RL post-training. Table 8 lists the shared training parameters for our two primary experimental models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Deepseek-math-7b-Instruct. Table 7: RL-MIA data splits for training and evaluation. The last column reports the total number of evaluation items (Contam + Clean).", "For reproducibility, we also provide the key hyperparameters used during RL post-training.

Full details are available in the training scripts included with our released code. G LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK While our work presents a robust framework for detecting contamination in the RL post-training phase, we acknowledge several avenues for future research that build upon our findings. Generalization Across Diverse Domains. Our experiments primarily focused on mathematical and logical reasoning tasks, as these are prominent domains where RL has demonstrated significant benefits. However, the unique characteristics of RL-induced contamination may vary across differ- ent problem domains. For instance, in areas such as code generation, where a wider diversity of valid solutions is common, the signature of policy collapse might manifest differently. Future work could extend the evaluation of Self-Critique and other reward-aware detection methods to these and other domains, thereby assessing the broader applicability and potential domain-specific adaptations of our method. Scalability to Larger Models. The models used in our study, ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters, are representative of a widely used class of open-source LLMs. However, the landscape of foun- dation models is rapidly evolving, with state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models now exceeding hundreds of billions of parameters. While we have no reason to believe our method\u2019s core principles would not apply, the dynamics of policy collapse and memorization at such scales are not yet fully understood.

This paradigm has been further extended to the Multimodal RAG (MRAG) framework, which leverages external multimodal knowledge (such as images, audio, and video) to address increasingly complex, real-world information-seeking tasks [41, 81]. Among these modalities, video-based MRAG [23, 37, 48, 57, 79] poses unique challenges due to its temporal dynamics, the tight coupling of visual and auditory streams, and the presence of dense, transient details [39]. To evaluate the increasingly sophisticated capabilities of video- based MRAG systems, numerous benchmarks [5, 7, 30, 75] have been proposed, typically focusing on tasks such as basic factual retrieval in visual questions, general video event understanding, or cross-modal reasoning. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see full-size case in Appendix A) and Table 1, existing benchmarks face two key limitations when confronted with real-world complex- ity. (1) limited modality and format coverage: current bench- marks often involve restricted modality pairings (e.g., text-video or audio-video), overlooking datasets that simultaneously encompass audio-text-video streams and densely embedded domain-specific formats, such as data charts, complex tables, or dynamic on-screen text, which are critical for real-life video comprehension. (2) in- sufficient fine-grained reasoning: most benchmarks rely on coarse-grained analysis, such as scene classification or major en- tity recognition, and do not adequately evaluate a model\u2019s ability to perform precise, detailed multimodal reasoning. For example, extracting exact numerical values from rapidly changing charts or following sequential, understanding the complex operations and timing relationships in a tutorial, both of which are essential for grounded, factual multimodal question answering task. To address these limitations, we introduce the Comprehensive Fine-grained Video-based retrieval-augmented generation Bench- mark (CFVBench), a large-scale, manually verified, multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate video-based MRAG sys- tems. CFVBench is constructed from real-world videos on YouTube. It contains 599 videos and 5,360 open-ended question-answering (QA) pairs, spanning high-density content such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials. The benchmark requires models to retrieve information across long temporal video spans and multiple modalities while maintaining a high level of fine-grained visual fidelity. Using CFVBench, we conduct a compre- hensive evaluation of 7 popular retrieval methods and 14 publicly available Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing a critical bottleneck: existing methods (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle significantly with fine-grained multimodal comprehension.

CFVBench: A Comprehensive Video Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Motivated by this critical finding, we propose the Adaptive Vi- sual Refinement (AVR) framework. AVR is a simple yet effective, two-stage framework that enables MLLMs to assess their current information state and execute a resource-efficient refinement strat- egy. In the first stage, adaptive frame interpolation mechanism employs a scoring system to evaluate information sufficiency and automatically increase frame sampling density only when an incom- plete evidence chain is detected. In the second stage, on-demand tool invocation strategy intelligently activates specialized external tools, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [63] and object detectors [8], when necessary to extract embedded visual text or entity relevant to the query. Experimental results show that AVR", "when an incom- plete evidence chain is detected. In the second stage, on-demand tool invocation strategy intelligently activates specialized external tools, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [63] and object detectors [8], when necessary to extract embedded visual text or entity relevant to the query. Experimental results show that AVR effectively enhances the fine-grained multimodal comprehension of existing MLLMs, enabling them to capture subtle visual details and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the proposed CFVBench. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1) We introduce CFVBench, a large-scale MRAG benchmark (599 videos, 5,360 QA pairs) with high-density content (e.g., charts, tutorials), specifically designed to assess complex fine-grained mul- timodal comprehension across long temporal video spans. 2) We evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 MLLMs on CFVBench, uncovering a key bottleneck of existing MLLMs in fine-grained multimodal comprehension, likely caused by internal hallucinations and insufficient attention to transient details. 3) We propose AVR, a simple yet effective framework that lever- ages adaptive frame interpolation and on-demand tool invocation to enhance fine-grained visual understanding and improve perfor- mance across all evaluated MLLMs. The dataset, code, and prompts will be released upon acceptance of the paper. 2 Related Works 2.1 Multimodal RAG Benchmarks Existing Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) benchmarks have progressively expanded the integration of diverse modalities [41, 81], including text, images, audio, and video. Early knowledge-based visual question answering datasets, such as KB- VQA [66] and KVQA [55], rely on closed-domain knowledge, while OK-VQA [40] and A-OKVQA [54] incorporate external knowledge but mainly focus on single-step retrieval rather than complex rea- soning. More recent benchmarks have broadened modality coverage and task complexity. MRAG-Bench [22] and MRAMG-Bench [76] combine text and images, Chart-MRAG Bench [73] integrates tex- tual and chart data, ManyModalQA considers text, images, and ta- bles, WavCaps [42], and MusicCaps [1] emphasize audio-language understanding, KnowIT VQA [17] and SOK-Bench [64] focus on video reasoning, and InfoSeek [7] and Encyclopedic VQA [43] ad- dress knowledge-intensive, information-seeking tasks. Benchmarks with broader modality coverage, such as MultiModalQA [59] and AVHaystacks [10], still tend to simplify question formats through templates or multiple-choice settings (further comparison of the benchmarks are illustrated in Table 1.) Despite these advancements, most existing benchmarks remain limited in modality and format diversity and lack systematic evaluation of fine-grained reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce CFVBench, a benchmark de- signed to evaluate fine-grained multimodal comprehension ability of different video-based MRAG systems. 2.2 Multimodal RAG Methods Early MRAG methods typically converted multimodal data into unified textual representations for a text-based RAG pipeline [37, 79], causing substantial information loss, while later approaches preserved original multimodal data and introduced MLLMs for cross-modal retrieval and generation [57, 78]. Recent MRAG sys- tems incorporate advanced modules such as multimodal search planners [35, 65], interleaved text-image output modules [28, 80], LLM-based cross-modal rerankers [33, 48], and cross-modal refin- ers [23, 69] to achieve end-to-end multimodal interaction. Despite these advances, evaluation still relies heavily on VQA [29, 32] or VidQA datasets [53, 77], limiting assessment of fine-grained rea- soning. By conducting experiments on the proposed CFVBench, we find", "modules [28, 80], LLM-based cross-modal rerankers [33, 48], and cross-modal refin- ers [23, 69] to achieve end-to-end multimodal interaction. Despite these advances, evaluation still relies heavily on VQA [29, 32] or VidQA datasets [53, 77], limiting assessment of fine-grained rea- soning. By conducting experiments on the proposed CFVBench, we find that existing video-based MRAG methods struggle with detailed multimodal comprehension, which motivates the Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR) framework that evaluates retrieved visual information and selectively enhances frame sampling or invokes specialized tools to improve fine-grained comprehension. 3 CFVBench 3.1 Preliminary Video-based MRAG is typically formulated as a two-stage process: (1) Retrieval. Given a textual question \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5e, a retriever \ud835\udc45selects a subset of videos (or video segments) \ud835\udc49= {\ud835\udc491,\ud835\udc492, . . . ,\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc58} that are most relevant to the question. The goal of this stage is to iden- tify a minimal set of videos containing sufficient information to answer question\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5e, thereby enabling efficient downstream process- ing. (2) Generation. A MLLM \ud835\udc40then takes the question\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5eand the retrieved video subset \ud835\udc49as input, i.e., (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc49), and synthesizes in- formation across multiple modalities and temporal video segments to generate the final answer \ud835\udc34. Formally, this can be expressed as \ud835\udc34= \ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc49) (1) To evaluate retrieval and generation while assessing fine-grained multimodal comprehension ability, we introduce CFVBench, a large- scale, manually verified benchmark of high-density videos. 3.2 Dataset Construction As shown in Fig. 2, the construction of CFVBench follows a 4-stage pipeline designed to ensure diversity, difficulty, and quality: (1) Video Curation. We curated videos from YouTube spanning diverse domains such as finance, climate, and environment. Our focus was on content that inherently requires multimodal and fine- grained reasoning. The videos fall into three main categories: (i) Structured-Data Videos: Videos containing dense visual information such as charts and tables, which require accurate extraction of fine- grained details and numerical reasoning, aligned with transcripts. (ii) Tutorials: Instructional content (e.g., software or websites uti- lizing workflows) where UI operations are tightly coupled with audio scripts, demanding cross-modal reasoning. (iii) News: News reports that integrate live footage, scrolling captions, and occa- sional charts or texts, requiring models to capture objects, entities, scenes, dynamics, and transient information. The specific websites corresponding to these categories are listed in Appendix B. Each curated video is paired with its transcript and audio track, ensuring that CFVBench offers comprehensive Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

(2) Keypoints Generation. First, we used Qwen2.5-VL-72B- Instruct [61] to automatically identify informative timestamps un- der a category-specific protocol: For tutorial videos, the model segmented steps and annotated each operation concisely. For struc- tured data videos, it detects comprehensive data formats such as charts, tables, maps, and flowcharts, and outputs start and end times with", "used Qwen2.5-VL-72B- Instruct [61] to automatically identify informative timestamps un- der a category-specific protocol: For tutorial videos, the model segmented steps and annotated each operation concisely. For struc- tured data videos, it detects comprehensive data formats such as charts, tables, maps, and flowcharts, and outputs start and end times with formatted semantic tags in JSON. For news videos, salient frames were recognized and described at the image level (e.g., polar bears walking on ice). All outputs were stored in a unified JSON schema with temporal boundaries and semantic annotations, pro- viding reliable anchors for keypoint extraction. Following [73, 84], keypoints are fine-grained, semantically in- dependent facts from videos or subtitles, serving as ground truth for QA construction and evaluation. To handle diverse video do- mains, we designed tailored extraction protocols. For Structured- Data and News videos, we extracted (i) textual keypoints from sub- titles via DeepSeek-R1 [12], and (ii) visual keypoints from frames aligned with timestamps using Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. For Tu- torial videos, where narration and on-screen actions are tightly coupled, we generated hybrid keypoints from subtitles, frames, and timestamps, encoding explicit (action, object, outcome) triples (e.g., \u201cthe user clicks the \u2018File\u2019 button \u2192the \u2018Save As\u2019 dialog box opens \u2192 a file path is displayed\u201d). This framework ensures QA tasks require cross-modal reasoning rather than a single modality. To improve accuracy, we applied the LLMs three times on each sample and took the intersection of the results. (3) QA Pair Generation. Building on extracted keypoints, we constructed open-ended QA pairs with DeepSeek-R1. We gener- ate (i) single-hop questions, answerable from a single keypoint (e.g., factual or numerical detail) from a single modality, and (ii) multi-hop questions, requiring integrating two or more key points (e.g., sequential tutorial steps or combining visual and textual evi- dence) from multiple modalities. Questions primarily follow factual and procedural forms (\u201cWhat,\u201d \u201cHow\u201d) while also including causal (\u201cWhy\u201d), comparative (\u201cHow does ... compare\u201d), and conditional (\u201cWhat happens if ...\u201d) patterns. Answers are grounded in key- points without external inference, QA are independent and align with the general cognitive level of human video viewing, supporting reliable evaluation of retrieval and multi-step reasoning.

(4) QA Pair Filtering. To ensure the quality of generated QA pairs, we employed DeepSeek-R1 to make each QA pair automati- cally checked against 4 criteria: (i) for multi-hop questions, all listed keypoints must be necessary to construct the complete answer; re- dundant or unused keypoints were removed, (ii) duplicates across QA pairs were eliminated, (iii) QA pairs unrelated to the topic were discarded, and (iv) overly mechanical or unnatural questions (e.g., over-detailing or forced associations) were filtered out. To further enhance the quality of CFVBench and ensure ques- tions are meaningful to humans and align with real-life application scenarios, we conduct human modification. We recruited 13 gradu- ate students from", "topic were discarded, and (iv) overly mechanical or unnatural questions (e.g., over-detailing or forced associations) were filtered out. To further enhance the quality of CFVBench and ensure ques- tions are meaningful to humans and align with real-life application scenarios, we conduct human modification. We recruited 13 gradu- ate students from local universities, all with academic backgrounds in computer science, journalism, or English, and IELTS scores above 7.0. Before annotation, they underwent training that introduced the task objectives and detailed guidelines (aligned with QA pair filter- ing criteria), demonstrated examples of both correct and incorrect annotations, emphasized data privacy and responsible usage, and clarified that they need to modify the QA pairs to make semantics more precise while keeping content unchanged. During annotation, each annotator was assigned a subset of QA pairs, with 30% over- lapping between two annotators. Annotators were also instructed to adjust temporal segments when initial video timestamps were CFVBench: A Comprehensive Video Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY incorrectly split. A QA pair was finalized only when both annota- tors provided consistent annotations, ensuring dataset reliability. Additionally, for quality control, 2 supervising annotators randomly sampled 20% of every 100 QA pairs. If any issue was found, the process was repeated until all sampled pairs satisfied the standards. The prompts in this section are shown in Appendix F (1-9). 3.3 Dataset Composition After the dataset construction process, CFVBench consists of 3 core video categories: structured-data videos, tutorials, and news. as shown in Fig. 3, these categories are further divided into topics such as finance, climate, software operations, and commerce, covering key areas of real-world applications. Statistically, as reported in Table 7 of Appendix C, CFVBench contains a total of 5,360 question- answer pairs. To evaluate different levels of reasoning complexity, the test set includes 3,703 single-hop questions and 1,660 multi-hop questions. On average, multi-hop questions require integrating 2.72 keypoints across different modalities, placing higher demands on the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities. Additionally, the average video length is 232.3 seconds, and the average question length is 15.22 words, reflecting rich content and moderate question complexity. 4 Evaluation on CFVBench MRAG frameworks are typically composed of two core stages: re- trieval and generation. To thoroughly assess existing video-based MRAG methods\u2019 performance, we separately evaluate both stages of MRAG on the proposed CFVBench. The following sections will first introduce the baselines, evaluation metrics, and implementa- tion details relevant to both stages, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results. 4.1 Evaluation Settings Baselines. The retrieval stage employs 3 widely-utilized multi- modal retrieval methods, including ImageBind [19], InternVideo [68], and LanguageBind [83] that align video and text representations within a shared embedding space. Building upon this, the nomic- embed-text [45] model is incorporated to specifically capture se- mantic similarities in the textual modality. After the retrieval stage, the top-\ud835\udc58video clips identified by the best-performing retrieval method are passed to the generation stage. During the generation stage, we combine the retrieval results and conduct a zero-shot evaluation on CFVBench with 14 MLLMs, including: Gemma-3-12b-it [60], Gemma-3-27b-it, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-", "se- mantic similarities in the textual modality.

Evaluation Metrics. For retrieval evaluation, we adopt Re- call@K [73] (R@K), which measures whether at least one relevant video is included among the top-\ud835\udc58retrieved results. We report Re- call@1, Recall@3, Recall@5, and Recall@10 to capture performance across different cutoff thresholds. We evaluate two query types: (1) multi-point: queries require retrieving videos containing multiple keypoints across different modalities; (2) single-point: queries target videos with a single keypoint, further divided into text-single-point (speech/transcript-based, where keypoints are derived from audio transcripts) and video-single-point (visual content-based, where keypoints originate from visual information) to assess modality- specific retrieval capabilities. In the generation stage, following [73, 84], evaluation metrics are divided into two categories. (1) Automatic evaluation: To assess a model\u2019s ability to leverage multimodal information in CFVBench, we adopt keypoint-based recall, precision, and F1-score [47]. Re- call is computed for video (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc63= \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc63/\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc63) and textual key- points (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61), where \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61denote correctly matched keypoints and \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61mean total keypoints, the overall recall is \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59= (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc63+ \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61)/(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc63+ \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61). Precision measures the propor- tion of correctly covered keypoints among all factual claims (\ud835\udc40) in the response (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b= (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc63+ \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61)/\ud835\udc40), and F1 is their har- monic mean. We also introduce ROUGE-L [31] to capture lexical overlap. (2) LLM-as-Judge evaluation: We average the results from Qwen3-8B-Instruct [62] and GLM-4-9B [20] to holistically score model outputs. Each response is rated on three dimensions: Fac- tual Coverage (Fact_cov), Visual Detail Usage (Vis_use), Linguistic Precision (Ling_prec), and assigned a final score on a 1\u20135 Likert scale [24]. Additionally, we compute semantic similarity (St_cos) between generated and reference answers using all-MiniLM-L6- v2 [51]. Relevant prompts are in Appendix F (1-9). Implementation Details. During the retrieval stage, we fol- low the procedure in [52], which leverages both audio transcrip- tions and video captions. Specifically, the audio of each video is transcribed using Faster-Distil-Whisper-Large-v3 [16], while visual frames sampled at 6-second intervals are captioned with MiniCPM- V-4-int4 [74], conditioned on the corresponding audio information. Based on these modalities, we generate multimodal embeddings from the raw videos and extract text embeddings from the gen- erated descriptions. The top-\ud835\udc58full videos are first retrieved using cosine similarity, after which each is segmented into 30-second clips, and the results of best-performing retrieval method are then passed to the generation stage. In the generation stage, we follow [52] and further segment each video into 6-second clips, from which the five most relevant ones are selected. For each clip, its transcript is combined with 5 frames sampled at 6-second intervals, and the resulting multimodal input is fed into the MLLM in the retrieval order to generate the final answer. To ensure deterministic outputs,", "video into 6-second clips, from which the five most relevant ones are selected. For each clip, its transcript is combined with 5 frames sampled at 6-second intervals, and the resulting multimodal input is fed into the MLLM in the retrieval order to generate the final answer. To ensure deterministic outputs, we set the temperature to 0.1 and top-\ud835\udc5dto 1. All MLLMs are evaluated using identical prompts Appendix F (11) on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB of memory. 4.2 Evaluation Results Analysis of Retrieval Results. As shown in Table 2, we could find: combining textual and multimodal embeddings yields consistent improvements, with LanguageBind + nomic-embed-text achieving the best overall R@10 of 81.37%, underscoring the complementary strengths of text and video representations. In comparison, multi- modal embeddings alone generally outperform text-only retrieval on single-point queries, where the best video model (LanguageBind) achieves 76.17% R@10, slightly above the text baseline (76.11%). However, multi-point queries remain particularly challenging. An interesting observation is that multimodal embeddings underper- form text-only embeddings under multi-point setting, suggesting that the video modality may introduce noise and hinder multi-hop Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

Moreover, across all multimodal methods, performance in multi-point setting lags behind single-point results, with even the best hybrid approach reaching only 71.62% R@10. This substantial drop highlights that current models still struggle with fine-grained temporal integration and multi-hop reasoning. Analysis of Generation Results. As shown in Table 3, the experimental results on CFVBench reveal several insights: (1) there are substantial performance differences among different MLLMs. For example, considering \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61, the highest-performing model achieves 0.2941 while the lowest is only 0.0685, indicating a large gap in the ability to extract key fine-grained information. (2) Al- though closed-source models that are not specifically designed for video tasks, such as gemini, do not show significant advantages over newer open-source video-oriented models, they demonstrate relatively stable performance across metrics, highlighting their ef- fectiveness and reliability in video-based MRAG task. (3) The overall performance of all evaluated models remains modest across auto- matic and LLM-as-Judge evaluation, demonstrating the challenge posed by CFVBench and underscoring the necessity and importance of studying fine-grained video-based MRAG. To further investigate model behavior, we conducted a man- ual error analysis. We randomly sampled 100 generated answers from Gemma-3-27B, MiniCPM-V-2_6, Gemma-27B, and Intern-S1- mini, and asked 3 annotators to label each response according to 6 predefined error types. Majority voting was applied, and Fleiss\u2019s kappa [14] of 0.81 indicated strong inter-annotator agreement.

First, adap- tive frame interpolation mechanism assesses evidence from sparse frame sampling and adaptively increases frame density for criti- cal segments. Second, visual refinement and generation strategy performs on-demand tool invocation, such as OCR [63] and ob- ject detection (DET) [8], and aggregates multimodal evidence to generate the final answer. The workflow of AVR is shown in Fig. 5. 5.1 Adaptive Frame Interpolation Adaptive frame interpolation evaluates the sufficiency of initial evidence and determines whether denser sampling is needed. For each retrieved video segment \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56, we first conduct video processing: (1) Sparse Frame Sampling: extract \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52frames (e.g., \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52= 5) to form a sparse frame set \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52.

We then feed the query\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5e, subtitles\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f, and summary \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61into the MLLM-based refinement planner with a refinement prompt (Appendix F (10)), which explicitly instructs the model to assess whether the current evidence suffices to answer the query and to identify potentially missing information. The planner outputs an Information Sufficiency Score \ud835\udc46\u2208[0, 10], which integrates an overall answerability score measuring how well the query can be addressed given the current evidence and an information density score evaluating the richness and granularity of visual content in \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52and\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f. A higher score \ud835\udc46indicates sufficient evidence, while a lower score signals missing fine-grained details. Based on the information sufficiency score \ud835\udc46, AVR determines the number of frames \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61to sample according to: \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc46) = ( \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52 if \ud835\udc46> \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b+ (\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b) \u00b7 \ud835\udf03\u2212\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udf03 if \ud835\udc46\u2264\ud835\udf03 (2) where \ud835\udf03is the threshold (set to 5.0) and [\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65] is the refine- ment interval (set to [20, 40]; following Kandhare and Gisselbrecht [25] and Luo et al. [36], they both identify that the sampling rate achieves optimal results at around 1 fps). If \ud835\udc46> \ud835\udf03, the original sparse frames are retained; otherwise, denser sampling is applied proportionally to the severity of the information gap. Interpolated frames are filtered by visual similarity to reduce redundancy, and only diverse frames are retained for caption generation. Captions from these refined frames are merged with existing subtitles to con- struct a richer, fine-grained representation, which is subsequently fed into the visual refinement and generation stage of AVR. 5.2 Visual Refinement and Generation Guided by the MLLM-based refinement planner, we perform on- demand tool invocation and multimodal evidence aggregation to construct a rich feature representation for final answer generation.

(1) On-demand Tool Invocation. The refinement planner de- termines whether specialized tools are required (Appendix F (10)). Specifically, OCR and DET tools are invoked only when explicitly required: OCR is used when the query depends on reading sym- bolic or structured visual data (e.g., numbers, UI elements, tables, charts), while DET is applied when answering requires recognizing entity categories, attributes, or spatial relations (e.g., object state, interactions, fine-grained classification). If OCR is triggered, we apply EasyOCR [63] to the selected target frames \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61to extract symbolic or numeric information, such as textual overlays, tables, or chart values, and aggregate the re- sults into \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f.

Table 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of AVR. Incorporating AVR leads to consistent metric improvements across most MLLMs, with particularly notable gains in \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc63; for in- stance, MiniCPM-V-2_6 rises from 0.3793 to 0.4561, confirming AVR\u2019s ability to enhance fine-grained multimodal comprehension through dynamic frame sampling and selective OCR/object de- tection. These results suggest that AVR enables models to better capture critical visual details and reason over dense video content. A slight drop in \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61for some models reflects the trade-off be- tween richer visual coverage and potential retrieval noise. We also present performance and robustness analyses, including method comparisons and retrieval reordering experiments. Detailed results are available in Appendix ?? and Appendix D. Ablation Study. To assess the contribution of each AVR compo- nent, we perform ablation studies on two representative MLLMs: Gemma-3-27B and InternVL3.5-30B. As shown in Table 5, all mod- ules improve fine-grained multimodal comprehension. The adaptive frame interpolation strategy consistently boosts both \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc63and \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52by mitigating information loss through dynamic sampling.

To further investigate model performance in complex scenarios that require integrating fine-grained visual cues for multi-step reasoning, we take Qwen2.5- VL-7B-Instruct as an base model and compare the 1\u20135 Likert [24] CFVBench: A Comprehensive Video Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY 0 10 20 30 FG TE OM CA FH IA Figure 8: Human evaluation on CFVBench with AVR. score distribution for multi-hop questions with (Multi-hop*) or without AVR (Multi-hop). Higher Likert scores indicate better bal- anced use of multimodal information and more complete coverage of keypoints. As shown in Fig. 6, incorporating AVR leads to a noticeable increase in average Likert scores, particularly for score 4, demonstrating that AVR enables the model to better compre- hend fine-grained content, which in turn supports more accurate multimodal multi-hop reasoning. Impact of Retrieval Top-\ud835\udc58. As shown in Fig. 7, we also con- ducted experiments comparing different retrieval top-\ud835\udc58settings, using the Likert score as the evaluation metric. The Likert [24] score provides a", "enables the model to better compre- hend fine-grained content, which in turn supports more accurate multimodal multi-hop reasoning. Impact of Retrieval Top-\ud835\udc58. As shown in Fig. 7, we also con- ducted experiments comparing different retrieval top-\ud835\udc58settings, using the Likert score as the evaluation metric. The Likert [24] score provides a holistic assessment of answer clarity, balanced use of multimodal information, and coverage of keypoints. We observe that as \ud835\udc58increases from 1 to 5, the performance of nearly all mod- els improves, indicating that retrieving more relevant segments is generally beneficial for the fine-grained video-based MRAG task. However, the magnitude of improvement varies across models, sug- gesting that different MLLMs have varying abilities to capture and utilize fine-grained multimodal information. Human Evaluation. Following the same protocol as Section 4.2, we further evaluated 100 responses from 4 representative MLLMs after integrating the AVR framework. Each response was indepen- dently annotated by 3 human raters, achieving a Fleiss\u2019s kappa [14] of 0.83, indicating strong agreement. Majority voting results are shown in Fig. 8, we find: (1) compared to methods without AVR in Fig. 4, both FG and TE errors of all MLLMs notably decreased, validating AVR\u2019s effectiveness in capturing fine-grained visual cues via adaptive frame selection and OCR/DET tools; while (2) hal- lucination and contextual association errors persist, particularly for MiniCPM-V-2_6, suggesting that intrinsic reasoning instability remains even when visual details are accurately captured. A case study experiment was also conducted, please refer to Appendix E. 7 Conclusions In this work, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, human-checked benchmark of 599 real-world videos and 5,360 open-ended QA pairs spanning tables, charts, and other formats. The benchmark covers audio-text-video modalities and is designed to evaluate fine-grained multimodal comprehension in existing video-based MRAG systems. Comprehensive evaluation of 7 retrieval methods and 14 MLLMs reveals that current approaches struggle with transient but critical multimodal details. To address this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that combines adaptive frame sampling with on-demand tool invocation, con- sistently enhancing fine-grained understanding and overall per- formance across all the evaluated MLLMs. CFVBench and AVR could provide a practical testbed and methodology for advancing video-based multimodal reasoning in real-world scenarios.

D Robustness Experiment We further evaluate AVR\u2019s robustness via a reorder experiment, in which the five retrieved video clips are randomly shuffled. As shown in Table 8, models with AVR consistently outperform their base counterparts across F1, St_cos, and Likert scores. For example, Gemma-3-27B shows a 6.26% F1 and 2.68% St_cos improvement, indicating that AVR reliably enhances fine-grained reasoning even when the input clip order is disrupted. E Case Study To qualitatively illustrate AVR\u2019s capabilities, we present a case study with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Figure 10), where key clues appear in Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

Question From a spatial comparison perspective, what key changes occurred in Arctic sea ice extent between 1997 and 2017? Video Transcript from Audio Answer + AVR The spatial comparison map shows that there has been a significant reduction in Arctic sea ice extent between 1997 and 2017. The data indicates that the Arctic sea ice has melted to near record levels, with less than one-third of its coverage compared to just two decades ago. This is attributed to global warming, which is causing the Arctic to warm twice as fast as the global average, leading to a rapid loss of sea ice. ... 0:42 In less than four decades, the Arctic has lost three-quarters of its sea ice. 0:46 It covers a third less of the ocean than it did just 20 years ago. ... Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct Answer without AVR The Arctic sea ice has significantly decreased from the 1980s to the early 2000s due to global warming, with projections suggesting it may become ice-free during summer within two decades.

Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation Xiangxu Zhang1, Lei Li1, Yanyun Zhou1, Xiao Zhou1*, Yingying Zhang2, Xian Wu2 1GSAI, Renmin University of China, 2Tencent Jarvis Lab {xansar, xiaozhou}@ruc.edu.cn kevinxwu@tencent.com Abstract Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and com- plex domain that is critical to patient care. How- ever, current evaluations of large language mod- els (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public med- ical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent ef- forts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promis- ing alternative, but their improvements are lim- ited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clin- ical practice. Unlike static exam-style ques- tions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation- like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiag- nosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Be- yond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our ex- periments demonstrate that this dynamic ap- proach yields more challenging and realistic as- sessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These find- ings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics. 1 Introduction Accurate medical diagnostics is vital for patient health and effective treatment. However, the in- herent complexity (e.g., the diversity of symptom- diagnosis relationships) and external factors (e.g., incomplete information and various expression styles) pose significant challenges (Studdert et al., *Corresponding Author A 80-year-old male with right groin discomfort, frequent urination, and nocturia. What are the possible diagnoses and treatments? I\u2019m 80, and my right lower belly hurts. It must be prostate cancer because I pee a lot and wake up at night. I need surgery. Exam Real-World Figure 1: (Top) Contamination data experiments on C- Eval (Huang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). (Bottom) Un- like standardized patients in current benchmarks, real- world patients express symptoms unprofessionally and may misdiagnose themselves, misleading doctors. 2005; Naik et al., 2022). Misdiagnoses can lead to severe consequences, such as higher mortality rates (Pourafkari et al., 2017) and increased health- care burdens (Juarez-Garcia et al., 2006), under- scoring the need for trustworthy diagnostic tools aligned with clinical practice (Pai et al., 2024). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show promise in assisting healthcare pro- fessionals by processing medical knowledge (Chen et al., 2024b) and supporting diagnostic deci- sions (Chen et al., 2024a). These LLMs can ana- lyze clinical cases (Wang et al., 2024b), identify patterns in laboratory medicine data (Ullah et al., 2024), and potentially improve diagnostic accu- racy (Fan et al., 2024). To assess their capabilities, static benchmarks based on medical exams have been developed (Liu et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2024), where the test questions remain fixed across models and time", "patterns in laboratory medicine data (Ullah et al., 2024), and potentially improve diagnostic accu- racy (Fan et al., 2024). To assess their capabilities, static benchmarks based on medical exams have been developed (Liu et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2024), where the test questions remain fixed across models and time (Zhu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). However, a key question remains: Do static benchmarks reflect real-world diagnostic capabil- ities of LLMs? Recent studies question the reli- arXiv:2510.09275v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 ability of static benchmarks (Jiang et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024). Two main limitations are cited: 1) Overestimation of model capabilities: Overesti- mation stems from data contamination (Li et al., 2024b; Xu et al., 2024), i.e., overlap between train- ing and test data, and benchmark saturation (Gupta et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024), where repeated ex- posure and task simplicity inflate scores, thereby misrepresenting true clinical competence. 2) Misalignment with real-world scenarios (Liu et al., 2024b; Park et al., 2024): Static benchmarks that reuse public exam questions suffer distributional shift. Their formulaic structure fails to capture clinical complexity, making them poor proxies for real-world performance. As shown in Fig.1, data contamination can exaggerate LLM perfor- mance. Exam-style questions omit real-world fea- tures like vague symptoms, lay terms, and self- misdiagnosis (Graber et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2017). These limitations, plus the high-stakes of medical diagnostics and the substantial cost of new dataset annotations (Lyu et al., 2024), hinder effec- tive evaluation and deployment of medical LLMs. To address these limitations, dynamic evalua- tion generates new test cases by superficially trans- forming raw questions, e.g., rewriting (Wang et al., 2025), adding noise (Zhu et al., 2024), altering graphs (Zhu et al., 2023). However, real-world di- agnostic settings involve misdiagnosis factors (e.g., anchoring bias (Graber et al., 2005)) and diverse expression styles\u2014issues not captured by current dynamic methods. Most existing methods focus solely on accuracy, neglecting that LLMs must pro- vide not only accurate diagnoses but also trustwor- thy clinical insights (Liu et al., 2024c), such as combating misinformation (Chen and Shu, 2024), offering clinically useful guidance (Ranjan et al., 2015), and keeping responses consistent (Capello and Cauduro, 2016). As a result, dynamic meth- ods remain misaligned with real-world needs in benchmarking LLM diagnostic capabilities. To overcome the limitations above, we propose DyReMe, a Dynamic, Realistic evaluation frame- work for Medical diagnostics. DyReMe has two key components: DyGen and EvalMed. DyGen gen- erates realistic diagnostic benchmarks by creating new questions that incorporate differential diag- noses and misdiagnosis factors as diagnostic dis- tractors (e.g., a sinusitis patient self-diagnosed with periodontitis). Additionally, DyGen takes patient expression features into account, ensuring that the generated questions reflect real-world query styles (e.g., a patient describing radiating pain as \u201can electric shock running down my arm\u201d). By combin- ing these approaches, DyGen ensures that the gener- ated benchmarks are both challenging and closely match real-world diagnostic situations. This ad- dresses the misalignment between evaluation and practical application. EvalMed assesses four as- pects: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consis- tency. It checks whether the model gives", "my arm\u201d). By combin- ing these approaches, DyGen ensures that the gener- ated benchmarks are both challenging and closely match real-world diagnostic situations. This ad- dresses the misalignment between evaluation and practical application. EvalMed assesses four as- pects: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consis- tency. It checks whether the model gives the correct diagnosis, corrects health rumors, provides useful explanations, and gives stable answers. This broad- ens the evaluation scope and raises the performance standards for LLMs, thereby mitigating benchmark overestimation and misalignment. Experiments demonstrate that DyReMe not only generates more challenging and realistic questions (via DyGen) but also provides trustworthy, human-aligned evalua- tions (via EvalMed), revealing key limitations of current LLMs in medical diagnostics. Contributions. (1) We propose DyReMe, a dy- namic evaluation framework for medical diagnos- tics that combines realistic benchmark generation (DyGen) with trustworthy evaluation (EvalMed). (2) Using DyGen, we construct a challenging bench- mark that is aligned with real-world practice. (3) We evaluate 12 LLMs with EvalMed, uncov- ering limitations in their diagnostic capabilities. 2 Related Work Static Benchmarks for Medical LLMs. Med- ical LLMs are often evaluated on static bench- marks such as PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), CMB (Wang et al., 2024b), and CMExam (Liu et al., 2023), which draw heavily from medical exams. Although mod- els like GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) perform well on such benchmarks, the fact that many ques- tions are public raises concerns of contamination and inflated results. Moreover, exam-style ques- tions often fail to capture real clinical complex- ity. Newer datasets such as MedBench (Cai et al., 2024), DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a), CliMed- Bench (Ouyang et al., 2024), and others (Ness et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Bedi and et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025) incorporate ex- pert annotations and better reflect clinical reasoning (e.g., RJUA (Lyu et al., 2024)), but remain costly and still face contamination, saturation, and lim- ited representativeness, consequently misalign with real-world clinical needs.

We focus on Chinese questions and the example question is translated from Chinese. (c) EvalMed assesses Accuracy, Veracity, Helpfulness, and Consistency. Dynamic Evaluation. Dynamic evaluation has been proposed to address the limitations of static benchmarks by rewriting, perturbing, or paraphras- ing raw questions (Kiela et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; White et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) . In this work, we focus on generating new medical diagnostic benchmarks from seed cases. Among these approaches, dynamic evaluation methods based on LLMs, such as DyVal2 (Zhu et al., 2024) and Self-Evolving (Wang et al., 2025) employ LLMs as generators to improve scalability and adaptability. DyVal2 introduces \u201cprobing\u201d and \u201cjudging\u201d agents to create new questions through paraphrasing, adding noise, and permutation. Self- Evolving applies six different reframing opera- tions to construct evolving instances, testing LLMs across query variations, noise, and problem-solving robustness. However, these methods overlook the specific requirements of medical diagnostics and fail to address the limitations of static benchmarks, as they mainly rely on superficial transformations. Summary. Existing benchmarks overestimate performance and fail to reflect clinical practice. Dy- namic methods attempt to bridge this gap but still miss real-world distractors and trustworthy assess- ment. To address this gap, we introduce DyReMe. 3 Methodology We propose DyReMe (Fig.2), a dynamic evalua- tion framework that better aligns with real-world clinical practice. It comprises two components: (1) DyGen, a generation module that creates realis- tic and challenging questions, and (2) EvalMed, an evaluation module that assesses LLMs across four clinically relevant dimensions: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. We begin by formally defining the diagnostic task. Given a question q based on a set of symptoms S = {si}N i=1 and an un- derlying diagnosis d, the LLM M, parameterized by \u03b8, generates a response \u02c6a = M(q). A scoring function f is used to assess the quality of \u02c6a. 3.1 DyGen: Dynamic Generation Current diagnostic benchmarks oversimplify the complexity and variability of real-world diagnos- tics, resulting in a misalignment with actual clini- cal consultations. Trustworthy diagnosis requires consideration of differential diagnoses (Arter and Jenkins, 1979) and misdiagnosis factors (Graber et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2017), collectively re- ferred to as \u201cdiagnostic distractors.\u201d To simulate real-world complexity, DyGen first constructs diag- nostic distractors by integrating differential diag- noses and misdiagnosis factors. It then incorporates these distractors into the questions and rephrases them to match authentic clinical expressions. Fi- nally, DyGen refines the questions", "et al., 2017), collectively re- ferred to as \u201cdiagnostic distractors.\u201d To simulate real-world complexity, DyGen first constructs diag- nostic distractors by integrating differential diag- noses and misdiagnosis factors. It then incorporates these distractors into the questions and rephrases them to match authentic clinical expressions. Fi- nally, DyGen refines the questions using a validator- refiner iterative loop to ensure clinical validity and maintain real-world complexity. Differential Diagnosis. DyGen retrieves similar diagnoses ddis for a given original diagnosis dorg, mimicking real-world differential diagnosis. This is achieved using Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (GRAG) (Lewis et al., 2020). For example, GRAG retrieves ddis = \u201cAdrenal adenoma\u201d as a differential diagnosis for dorg = \u201cPheochromocy- toma\u201d based on medical encyclopedias, since both share common symptoms like hypertension and headache (Fig.2a). Formally, ddis = GRAG(dorg). Misdiagnosis Factors. Anchor bias (Graber et al., 2005), posterior probability error (Nen- daz and Perrier, 2012), distraction (Graber et al., 2005), and symptom overestimation (Braun et al., 2017) pose challenges in clinical practice. To reflect these factors, DyGen designs four diag- nostic traps (Fig.2b): S={self-diagnosis, dis- tracting history, external noise, misplaced symp- toms}. Given a question qorg (e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me if I have hypertension and headache?\u201d), DyGen selects a trap s and a differential diagno- sis ddis (e.g., \u201cAdrenal adenoma\u201d), and combines them to form a misleading question qtrap (e.g., \u201cI might have an adrenal adenoma due to hyperten- sion and headache. Can you give me medicine?\u201d): qtrap = Ttrap(qorg, s, ddis), s \u223cU(S). (1) Here, Ttrap denotes the operation of constructing and adding distractors into questions, and U(\u00b7) is the uniform distribution function. These traps sim- ulate common real-world diagnostic pitfalls, mak- ing the questions more realistic, challenging, and better aligned with actual clinical scenarios. See Appendix A for detailed descriptions. Expression Style. Patients often describe symp- toms in lay language (Zeng and Tse, 2006; Forbush et al., 2013), reflecting their subjective perceptions rather than formal clinical nomenclature. To cap- ture this, DyGen employs a persona-driven stylistic adaptation mechanism that models diverse patient expression styles (Ge et al., 2024). However, in- tegrating persona information into questions may introduce unintended causal confounders and com- promise the validity of the ground truth. For ex- ample, personas (e.g., miners) may correlate with specific diagnoses (e.g., pneumoconiosis). To avoid this, DyGen applies an indirect adaptation operation (Tpersona). It first extracts expression features (e.g., knowledge level, clarity, and communication style) from a persona b, and then uses them to rephrase the question. This process is formalized as: qper = Tpersona(qtrap, b), b \u223cU(B). (2) For example, qper is \"My blood pressure\u2019s high and I keep getting bad headaches, and I think there\u2019s a bump on my kidney. Can you give me something for it?\" when b = \"Mason\", a persona with lim- ited medical knowledge. This variation mirrors real-world patient communication and introduces challenges that require LLMs to align diagnostic reasoning with non-standardized narratives. Validator\u2013Refiner Iterative Loop. Inspired by critique-and-revision paradigms (Tan et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2024), we implement an iterative re- finement loop to ensure the quality and realism of generated diagnostic questions.", "variation mirrors real-world patient communication and introduces challenges that require LLMs to align diagnostic reasoning with non-standardized narratives. Validator\u2013Refiner Iterative Loop. Inspired by critique-and-revision paradigms (Tan et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2024), we implement an iterative re- finement loop to ensure the quality and realism of generated diagnostic questions. At iteration t, a validator V evaluates candidate question qt along four dimensions (challenge, logical consistency, symptom accuracy, and trap effectiveness). If qt passes, the process terminates with q\u2217= qt. Oth- erwise, qt is returned to a refiner R, which revises the question based on validator feedback F(qt, V): ( qt, V(qt) = 1 R(qt, F(qt, V)), otherwise. (3) This loop improves question quality until all con- straints are satisfied. This process yields clinically realistic and diagnostically rigorous questions. 3.2 EvalMed: Medical Evaluation To assess LLMs\u2019 diagnostic capabilities beyond accuracy, EvalMed further evaluates veracity, help- fulness, and consistency. These dimensions ensure that LLMs not only provide accurate diagnoses but also generate responses that are veracious, helpful, and stable across different scenarios. Veracity. Veracity assesses whether LLMs can identify and correct medical misinformation, help- ing prevent the spread of harmful health rumors. Existing benchmarks validate outputs against ex- ternal knowledge bases (Dmonte et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024), but this often fails due to limited coverage and does not test whether models can proactively recognize or correct false claims (Min et al., 2023). In contrast, our method tests the model\u2019s ability to rectify medical rumors by pre- senting it with generated false statements. Inspired by SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), we use GRAG to generate rumor-fact pairs RF(m) = (em rumor, em fact) for medical entity m. Given m = \u201cHigh BP\u201d, we might have em rumor = \u201cHigh BP affects the bones\u201d and em fact = \u201cHigh BP affects the heart\u201d. We re- tain only valid pairs, i.e., those satisfying a ratio- nality check \u03c1(\u00b7) = 1, formalized as: RFvalid(m) = { r \u2208RF(m) | \u03c1(r) = 1 }. (4) To evaluate veracity, DyGen inserts a rumor into each question (e.g., \u201cMy BP is up, I heard that high BP affects the bones. Can you recommend some medications for bones?\u201d). EvalMed then tests whether the LLM rectifies the rumor: Ver(M) = 1 |Q| X q\u2208Q Ir(q, \u02c6a), (5) where Ver(M) is the score and Q is the set of all test questions. Ir(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the indicator function (implemented by a worker LLM) that determines whether the LLM\u2019s response rectifies the rumor. Helpfulness. LLMs evade responsibility by pro- viding vague or evasive answers. Thus, we eval- uate helpfulness (Yang et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2024) by measuring which criteria the response meets. Helpfulness is essential in medical diag- nostics, where answers must be clear, actionable, and in line with professional standards (Larasati et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024). We define three helpfulness criteria based on real-world medical platform guidelines (DingXiang, 2022): diagno- sis evidence, treatment suggestions, lifestyle sug- gestions. For each diagnosis in the benchmark, a knowledge base is built using GRAG, sourcing authoritative information from medical encyclo- pedias.", "standards (Larasati et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024). We define three helpfulness criteria based on real-world medical platform guidelines (DingXiang, 2022): diagno- sis evidence, treatment suggestions, lifestyle sug- gestions. For each diagnosis in the benchmark, a knowledge base is built using GRAG, sourcing authoritative information from medical encyclo- pedias. For each test question, EvalMed retrieves relevant context and assigns a score kq h for each criterion h. It then checks whether the response covers these points. For example, \u201cYou may have pheochromocytoma due to high BP and headache. Pheochromocytoma surgical excision could be a good option\u201d scores highly, as it includes both evi- dence and treatment suggestions. Formally: Help(M) = 1 |Q| X q\u2208Q X h\u2208H wh\u03a6h \u0000\u02c6a, kq h \u0001 , (6) where \u03a6h(\u00b7, \u00b7) measures coverage of the score- points for criterion h, and wh is its weight. Consistency. Consistency evaluates the stability of model predictions by computing the entropy of diagnoses across different variants of the same case. In high-stakes domains like medical diagnos- tics (Kadavath et al., 2022; Yadkori et al., 2024), inconsistent answers can erode user trust (Wu et al., 2024). To quantify consistency, we draw inspira- tion from Semantic Entropy (Farquhar et al., 2024). To reduce superficial variations, diagnostic terms are normalized. Consistency is then calculated as the normalized Information Entropy (Shannon, 1948) of the model\u2019s diagnosis distribution for each prediction group (i.e., all m variants of a original case). The score is mapped to [0, 100], where a higher value means more consistent predictions. As shown in the lower-right corner of Fig.2c, Pre- diction Group-\u2460is more consistent than Predic- tion Group-\u2461due to more concentrated predictions. The process is formalized as follows: Cons(M) = 1 |P| X pi\u2208P \u0012 1 \u2212Epi log m \u0013 , (7) where Epi is the entropy of diagnoses in prediction group pi, and P is the set of all prediction groups (one per original case). A higher consistency score indicates more stable predictions across different paraphrasings or expression styles. In summary, DyGen generates challenging, real- istic questions with real-world distractors and ex- pression styles, while EvalMed provides a compre- hensive evaluation across accuracy, veracity, help- fulness, and consistency. This enables DyReMe to better align with practical clinical needs. 4 Experiments This section investigates the following research questions: (RQ1) Does DyGen generate high- quality data? (RQ2) Are the evaluation results from EvalMed reliable? (RQ3) Are current LLMs trustworthy when conducting diagnostics? 4.1 Experimental Setup To evaluate DyReMe, we compare it with static and dynamic evaluation approaches. We construct a di- agnostic benchmark using DyGen with three static datasets as seeds: DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a), DDXPlus (Tchango et al., 2022), and Dxy (Xu et al., 2019). DxBench covers 461 diseases, DDX- Plus is synthetic for differential diagnosis, and Dxy is a small dataset derived from real-world medical consultations. For dynamic evaluation, we com- pare DyReMe with dynamic methods, including DyVal2 (Zhu et al., 2024) and Self-Evolving (Wang et al., 2025).

The best and runner-up results are boldfaced and underlined, respectively. The symbol \u2020 indicates commercial LLMs, and denotes medical LLMs. DyReMe significantly outperforms all baselines (p < 0.001, t-test with 10 runs 80% bootstrap sampling). 2025) as the generator and worker LLM, with a generation temperature of 0.7 and a verification temperature of 0. To benchmark 12 LLMs, we also create a larger benchmark of 3,200 questions based on 800 DxBench cases. We assess models on four dimensions: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. For GRAG, we utilize plugins and med- ical encyclopedias from VolcEngine (VolcEngine, 2025b). See Appendix B.1 for more details. 4.2 Assessment of Question Quality We assess question quality (RQ1) on two dimen- sions: challenge and diversity. A high-quality benchmark should be challenging to prevent perfor- mance overestimation and diverse to simulate real- world scenarios. We also experiment (Appendix E) to analyze impacts of Self-Recognition (Davidson et al., 2024) on benchmark results. Question Challenge. We evaluate the challenge level of each benchmark via accuracy across 10 LLMs. Results are shown in Tab.1, with details in Appendix B.2. Except for Self-Evolving, dynamic evaluation methods are generally more challenging than static benchmarks. For instance, DeepSeek- V3\u2019s accuracy drops from 72.92 on the static base- line to 69.50 on DyVal2, and further to 65.26 on DyReMe, demonstrating the increased difficulty. However, not all dynamic methods are consistently harder: many lack real-world diagnostic distrac- tors, so LLMs sometimes perform better on these dynamic benchmarks than on static ones. For exam- ple, GPT-4o-mini achieves 70.26 on Self-Evolving and 66.56 on DyVal2, both higher than its 66.08 on the static DxBench benchmark, indicating that these dynamic methods sometimes fail. In con- trast, DyReMe poses a substantially greater chal- lenge: GPT-4o-mini\u2019s score drops to 62.35, and GPT-4o decreases from a static average of 72.53 to 64.74 on DyReMe, a 10.75% drop, over twice that of DyVal2 (-3.94%). By incorporating real-world misdiagnosis patterns and patient-specific styles, DyReMe offers a more clinically grounded and rigorous", "DyReMe poses a substantially greater chal- lenge: GPT-4o-mini\u2019s score drops to 62.35, and GPT-4o decreases from a static average of 72.53 to 64.74 on DyReMe, a 10.75% drop, over twice that of DyVal2 (-3.94%). By incorporating real-world misdiagnosis patterns and patient-specific styles, DyReMe offers a more clinically grounded and rigorous evaluation of diagnostic performance. Question Diversity. A realistic benchmark should reflect the diverse ways patients describe symptoms and the broad range of diseases encoun- tered in practice. Therefore, we assess diversity with two metrics: expression diversity (Dexp), cal- culated as the entropy of expression style distri- bution, and diagnosis diversity (Ddiag), defined as the number of unique diagnoses (Appendix B.3). As shown in Fig. 3a, DyReMe improves both met- rics compared to static and dynamic baselines. By comparison, other baselines show diversity levels that are similar to or even lower than those of static benchmarks. For example, both dynamic meth- ods achieve similar diagnosis diversity as the static benchmarks. On Dxy, both dynamic methods ex- hibit lower expression diversity, likely due to con- ducting superficial transformations. By integrating expression styles, DyReMe notably increases ex- pression diversity. Furthermore, by incorporating differential diagnoses, DyReMe nearly quadruples the number of unique diagnoses on Dxy and dou- bles it on other datasets. These findings suggest that DyReMe better represents the complexity and DDxplus Dxbench Dxy 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 Expression ( \u2191) DDxplus Dxbench Dxy 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 210 Diagnosis ( \u2191) Original Self-Evolving DyVal2 DyReMe (a) Diversity Assessment 2 4 6 8 10 0.0 0.5 1.0 1-Self-BLEU ( \u2191) 2 4 6 8 10 1.00 4.25 7.50 Unique Diag.

To evaluate the ex- tensibility of DyReMe against existing methods, we select 100 seed samples from DxBench and generate k questions for each seed. We assess ex- tensibility by tracking how diversity changes as k increases. As shown in Fig.3b, Self-Evolving and DyVal2 yield low initial 1 \u2212Self-BLEU scores, which quickly drop to near zero as k increases. This reveals their limited extensibility. This may result from their reliance on superficial transformations of seed questions, leading to repetitive and less di- verse outputs. In contrast, DyReMe demonstrates a slower decline in 1 \u2212Self-BLEU, maintaining higher diversity scores as k increases, which indi- cates better extensibility. Furthermore, the num- ber of unique diagnoses generated by DyReMe increases steadily with k,", "on superficial transformations of seed questions, leading to repetitive and less di- verse outputs. In contrast, DyReMe demonstrates a slower decline in 1 \u2212Self-BLEU, maintaining higher diversity scores as k increases, which indi- cates better extensibility. Furthermore, the num- ber of unique diagnoses generated by DyReMe increases steadily with k, further supporting its superior extensibility. These results indicate that DyReMe can generate significantly more diverse questions from limited seed samples, demonstrat- ing greater extensibility than existing methods. Ablation Study. We conduct an ablation study on two key components of DyGen\u2014diagnostic distrac- tors (MD) and patient expression styles (MP)\u2014 using Dxy and DxBench as seed datasets. To as- sess the individual contribution of each component, we create two variants: DyReMe-w/o-MD and DyReMe-w/o-MP. We evaluate these variants on both challenge and diversity, as shown in Fig.3c. The results show that MD and MP contribute independently, and both are essential for optimal benchmark performance. Removing MP leads to a marked drop in expression diversity, while remov- ing MD significantly reduces diagnosis diversity and overall challenge. This underscores their re- spective roles in broadening expression styles and expanding disease coverage. These findings indi- cate that capturing both diverse patient narratives and a wide range of diagnoses is critical for realistic benchmark construction. Overall, both components are crucial for ensuring that DyReMe reflects the variability of real-world clinical scenarios. 4.4 Agreement with Human We conduct a human study to assess DyReMe\u2019s clinical alignment (RQ2). First, we assess the effec- tiveness of GRAG in retrieving differential diagnoses and helpfulness points. We sample 30 (dorg, ddis) pairs and 30 groups of score-points. Human an- notations show that 86.67% of the differential di- agnosis pairs are valid, and 83.37% of the score points are highly consistent with authoritative med- ical sources. Next, we sample 30 questions from DyReMe and invite three experts for two annota- tion tasks (Appendix B.5): (1) Question Quality Task: rating questions from 1 to 5 based on quality (e.g., rationality and clinical relevance). (2) Eval- uation Preference Task: select the more trustwor- thy one from two responses. We report inter-rater agreement using Gwet\u2019s AC1 (Gwet, 2008), which is preferred over Cohen\u2019s Kappa (McHugh, 2012) in cases of marginal imbalance (Wongpakaran et al., 2013). The AC1 statistic ranges from \u20131 (poor agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). Across both annotation tasks, the average AC1 is 0.6889, indi- cating strong overall agreement. For Task 1, the mean score of 3.89 indicates that the questions gen- erated by DyGen are of high quality, rational, and clinically relevant. For Task 2, the AC1 between DyReMe and experts reaches 0.8889, reflecting high consistency with expert judgment. Taken to- gether, these results demonstrate that DyReMe is well aligned with real-world clinical needs.

Symbol \u2020 repre- sents commercial LLMs. Icon denotes medical LLMs and indicates reasoning LLMs (Jaech et al., 2024). 4.5 Benchmarking Results We benchmark 12 leading LLMs using DyReMe (RQ3). As shown in Fig.4, commercial LLMs cur- rently maintain an overall lead, but research mod- els are quickly catching up. For example, Qwen3- 32B (45.7) and MedGemma-27B (39.1) outperform several commercial competitors like o1 and o1- mini (Jaech et al., 2024). Notably, domain-specific tuning is not a cure-all: the medically adapted WiNGPT2-9B achieves the lowest score (31.8), indicating that current adaptations may capture medical facts but often fail to handle real-world distractors and diverse expression styles. Com- mercial reasoning models (o1 and o1-mini) also show only moderate performance (37.0 and 36.7, respectively), likely because their training empha- sizes producing a single correct answer rather than addressing health rumors or providing actionable information. All models exhibit substantial room for improvement. Even the best models, such as Qwen3-32B (51.3) and GPT-4o (50.3), still strug- gle with realistic diagnostic noise. Across all mod- els, 20\u201340% of health rumors remain unaddressed, even for top-performing systems, posing a real risk of misinformation propagation. Most evidence and suggestions remain shallow, reflecting the difficulty current LLMs face in delivering explainable diag- noses and actionable advice. Consistency is consis- tently low across models, making them vulnerable to changes in input context. Overall, results from DyReMe indicate that current static and dynamic benchmarks overestimate LLM competence. To- day\u2019s LLMs are still not trustworthy enough for real-world clinical deployment. To better meet clinical needs, future models should account for ambiguous inputs, patient misconceptions, and the messiness of real clinical data. 4.6 Case Study Tabs.9\u201311 (in Appendix) compare the original case, versions generated by existing dynamic meth- ods, and DyReMe\u2019s version. DeepSeek-V3, GPT- 4o, and Qwen3-32B diagnose the original and dynamic baseline versions correctly but misdiag- nose DyReMe\u2019s version. For instance (Tab.9), DeepSeek-V3 overemphasizes the symptom \u201csmall pink rashes,\u201d misdiagnosed as contact dermatitis. Tabs.12\u201313 (in Appendix) show the evalua- tion results of GPT-4o (43.75) and WiNGPT2-9B (25.00). In this case, a patient self-diagnoses \u201csider- oblastic anemia\u201d and incorrectly assumes that \u201cFre- quent sneezing is usually harmless and not a sign of a serious problem.\u201d GPT-4o provides the correct di- agnosis (iron deficiency anemia), while WiNGPT2- 9B incorrectly follows the patient\u2019s self-diagnosis. However, GPT-4o only partially corrects the misin- formation, while WiNGPT2-9B fully addresses the health rumor. With regard to helpfulness, GPT- 4o provides detailed evidence of the diagnosis and offers effective suggestions, such as \u201cavoid overexertion and maintain a good daily routine\u201d, while WiNGPT2-9B only gives a brief suggestion of \u201canemia treatment\u201d. In terms of consistency, GPT-4o outputs three different diagnoses, while WiNGPT2-9B produces four, indicating greater consistency from GPT-4o. Overall, these case stud- ies demonstrate that DyReMe generates more real- istic and challenging questions, providing a clearer assessment of LLM trustworthiness. 5 Conclusion Static medical diagnostic benchmarks often overes- timate model ability and fail to reflect real-world complexity. To tackle this, we propose", "four, indicating greater consistency from GPT-4o. Overall, these case stud- ies demonstrate that DyReMe generates more real- istic and challenging questions, providing a clearer assessment of LLM trustworthiness. 5 Conclusion Static medical diagnostic benchmarks often overes- timate model ability and fail to reflect real-world complexity. To tackle this, we propose DyReMe\u2014 a dynamic framework for evaluating LLMs in med- ical diagnostics. DyReMe consists of two com- ponents: DyGen, which generates challenging and realistic questions by incorporating diagnostic dis- tractors and varied expression styles, and EvalMed, which evaluates LLMs across accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Experiments show that DyReMe provides a more rigorous and realis- tic assessment compared to existing benchmarks. Results reveal that current LLMs still face limita- tions in realistic diagnostic scenarios, especially when dealing with misdiagnosis factors and lay- language expressions. These findings call for fu- ture work on improving LLM reliability and safety in real-world medical applications. 6 Limitations We have only tested DyReMe on several public medical datasets and it cannot be directly applied to real-world clinical cases. Multilingual Scenarios. Due to constraints in available datasets and the accessibility of diagnos- tic guidelines, our experiments are conducted exclu- sively in Chinese so far. Consequently, we have not yet examined the performance of DyReMe in other languages or in multilingual contexts. Nevertheless, given its high scalability, extending DyReMe into a dynamic evaluation framework that supports mul- tilingualism is a promising direction for the future. Self-Bias. The issue of self-bias\u2014where an LLM evaluator might favor texts generated by itself\u2014is still a matter of debate (Xie et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023). To address this concern, we have taken a cautious approach by: (1) using differ- ent LLMs for DyGen and EvalMed, (2) employing RAG to encourage the LLM to derive informa- tion from external references rather than relying solely on its internal knowledge, and (3) strictly scoring according to the defined rules. Results in Appendix E show that Self-Recognition (Davidson et al., 2024)\u2019s impact is not significant. Medical Multimodality. In real-world clinical practice, physicians rely on a variety of modali- ties\u2014including medical images, laboratory results, and biosignals\u2014for diagnosis. However, such mul- timodal data are limited and challenging to obtain. As a result, we only focus on text-based diagnostic scenarios in this work. With the rapid advancement of multimodal LLMs, future research could explore extending DyReMe to evaluate these models in multimodal medical contexts. Future work should aim to develop large-scale, diverse, and challeng- ing evaluation benchmarks that incorporate these crucial multimodal inputs. Broader Medical Tasks. Our current focus is on consultation and diagnostic scenarios, as these are the most common and critical in consumer health contexts. Future research could explore adapting DyReMe for broader applications, such as medical report summarization (Xie et al., 2024), mortal- ity prediction (Li et al., 2021), and clinical trial matching (Wong et al., 2023). 7 Ethics Statement License. Our study utilizes four publicly avail- able medical datasets, including RJUA (Lyu et al., 2024), DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a), DDX- Plus (Tchango et al., 2022), and Dxy (Xu et al., 2019).

Our system is designed exclu- sively for research and educational purposes. The medical advice provided is intended solely as a reference. Utilizing the system for clinical deploy- ment carries inherent risks, as it has not undergone the rigorous validation required for direct applica- tion in patient care. Additionally, integrating LLMs with real medical data is highly sensitive. When testing with actual patient information, it is im- perative to use HIPAA-compliant services\u2014such as Azure OpenAI\u2014to ensure robust protection of patient data and to adhere to privacy regulations.

A Traps Description Below is an introduction to four types of traps: \u2022 Self-Diagnosis: Introduce patient-suggested diagnoses to simulate confirmation bias and test the LLM\u2019s ability to consider alternative possibilities. \u2022 Distracting History: Include irrelevant med- ical history to obscure key information and mimic over-interpretation bias. \u2022 External Noise: Add non-critical external fac- tors, such as environmental or lifestyle details, to replicate background noise bias. \u2022 Symptom Misplaced: Blur the distinction between primary and secondary symptoms, challenging the model\u2019s ability to focus on critical diagnostic clues. B Experiments Setup B.1 Dataset and Hyperparameter Details We have chosen three diagnostic datasets: \u2022 DDXPlus (Tchango et al., 2022) offers a syn- thetic dataset of 1.3 million patients, featuring differential diagnoses along with real patient pathology, symptoms, and medical history. We use the English version and translate it into Chinese to ensure consistency with other datasets. \u2022 DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a) is a real-world Chinese diagnostic benchmark comprising 1,148 actual cases spanning 461 diseases. \u2022 Dxy (Xu et al., 2019) is a Chinese diagnostic dataset sourced from an online health commu- nity, comprising 104 samples. We utilize the version provided by (Chen et al., 2024a). These three datasets are selected for their diverse sources and characteristics, ensuring a comprehen- sive evaluation of LLMs in medical diagnostics. For all datasets, we use their development and test sets. To align with the LLM diagnostic pat- tern, we transform the original symptom data into a patient inquiry format (Fig.7). To streamline de- velopment, we filtered out samples with multiple true diagnoses. DxBench contains 1148 questions, while Dxy has 104 questions. For DDXPlus, we randomly select 300 questions from the original dataset to ensure a manageable size for develop- ment. Across all experiments, we consistently set the generation temperature at 0.7, use a temperature of 0 for question verification, and maintain a tem- perature of 0 during evaluation. For DyVal2 (Zhu et al., 2024) and Self-Evolving (Wang et al., 2025), we use their official implementation. Since they were designed for multiple-choice questions rather than Q&A tasks, we remove processes that do not apply to the diagnostic Q&A task during experi- ments. To benchmark 12 leading LLMs, we gen- erate 3,200 questions based on 800 seed questions from DxBench, using Acc(\u00b7), Ver(\u00b7), Help(\u00b7), and Cons(\u00b7) as metrics. Alg.1 and Alg.2 detail the Dy- Gen and EvalMed algorithms, respectively. Algorithm 1 DyGen: Dynamic", "not apply to the diagnostic Q&A task during experi- ments.

We select 10 baselines. For every baseline LLM, we set the response temperature to 0 to ensure optimal performance. We measure challenge use the average of Top-1,3,5 diagnos- tic accuracy. Specifically, we instruct the LLM to provide a ranked list of diagnoses, and we judge whether the true diagnosis appears in the top 1, 3, or 5 positions. To mitigate randomness, we adopt the boost-trap method for hypothesis testing, follow- ing precedents in medical AI research (Yang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Specifi- cally, in each iteration, we randomly sample 80% of the evaluation dataset to form a subset, calculate the LLM\u2019s response accuracy on that subset, and repeat the process 10 times. We then conduct a one- sided t-test on these 10 sets of results to evaluate DyReMe\u2019s challenge advantage over the state-of- the-art method. Figs.17-18 are prompts used in challenge assessment. The p-values are reported in Tab.6. B.3 Diversity Experiment Setup In our experiments, we evaluate two types of diver- sity: expression diversity and diagnosis diversity. The procedures are detailed below. Expression Diversity 1. Extraction: For each question, use the an LLM to extract the style features.

The procedures are detailed below. Expression Diversity 1. Extraction: For each question, use the an LLM to extract the style features. The fea- tures have three dimensions (each dimension has three level): medical knowledge (low, medium, high), clarity (low, medium, high), and communication style (indirect, neutral, di- rect). 2. Computing Entropy: For each type, we com- pute the entropy of the level\u2019s distribution: H(X) = \u2212 n X i=1 pi log2(pi), where pi is the proportion of the i-th level in the distribution. Then we compute the average entropy across all three types: Dexp = 1 3 3 X i=1 H(Xi), where Xi is the distribution of the i-th type. The following pseudocode formalizes the above process: Algorithm 3 Compute Expression Diversity Input Q \u25b7set of questions 1: Initialize counts cntM, cntC, cntS to zero 2: for q \u2208Q do 3: (m, c, s) \u2190ExtractStyle(q) 4: cntM[m] + +, cntC[c] + +, cntS[s] + + 5: end for 6: function ENTROPY(cnt, N) 7: H \u21900 8: for each level \u2113with p = cnt[\u2113] N > 0 do 9: H\u2212= p log2 p 10: end for 11: return H 12: end function 13: N \u2190|Q| 14: Dexp \u2190 \u0000Entropy(cntM, N) + Entropy(cntC, N) + Entropy(cntS, N) \u0001 /3 15: return Dexp In the process of computing diversity, we uti- lize GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025) as the worker LLM. Figs.19-20 are prompts used in diversity assess- ment. B.4 Benchmark Experiment Setup We randomly select 800 questions from DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a) and generate 4 new questions for each using four types of traps (Appendix A), resulting in a benchmark with 3200 new questions. Our observations are conducted on 12 baseline LLMs: GPT-4o-2024- 11-20 (Hurst et al., 2024), GPT-4o-mini-2024-07- 18 (Hurst et al., 2024), o1-2024-12-47 (Jaech et al., 2024), o1-mini-2024-09-12 (Jaech et al., 2024), DeepSeek-V3-0324 (Liu et al., 2024a), Qwen3- 32B (Team, 2025), Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), WiNGPT2-Gemma-2-9B-Chat (Research, 2025), GLM-4-32B-0414 (GLM et al., 2024), Gemma-3-27B-it (Team et al., 2025), and MedGemma-27B-text-it (Sellergren et al., 2025). Figs.7-16 are prompts used for question generation. Figs.21-23 are prompts used in benchmark assessment. For all evaluation metrics, we use GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025) as the judge model, with a temperature of 0 for all evaluations. The max times of optimization iteration is set to 3. The number of scorepoints is set to 3. When answering questions, the number of max tokens is set to 2048, the number of sampling is 1, and in the prompt, we instruct the LLM not to output more than 200 words to ensure concise responses. We use personas from PersonaHub (Ge et al., 2024). For accuracy, we use the Top-1 accuracy as the final score. For veracity, we use the propotion of LLM rectifying rumors as the final veracity score. For veracity, we generate up to 10 rumor-fact pairs for a medical entity (e.g., a symptom). For helpfulness, with each item rated on 0\u2013100, we use the average score of", "accuracy as the final score. For veracity, we use the propotion of LLM rectifying rumors as the final veracity score. For veracity, we generate up to 10 rumor-fact pairs for a medical entity (e.g., a symptom). For helpfulness, with each item rated on 0\u2013100, we use the average score of hevi, htreat, and hlife as the final helpfulness score. We control the number of score-points at 3. For consistency, we conduct normalization to map the entropy value to a 0\u2013100 scale, where 0 indicates maximum inconsistency and 100 indicates maximum consistency. Detailed standard deviation is shown in Tab.2. B.5 Human Study Experiment Setup We invited three clinical doctoral students major- ing in medicine from a QS-ranked Top 100 medical college to act as medical annotators for expertise and reliability. All of them have at least one year of clinical experience. Given that analyzing a med- ical question and two responses is time-consuming (around 2 minutes per instance), it is challenging to further scale up the number of questions. Tab.8 shows the failure case of differential diagnoses re- trieval. Most cases are caused by the difference in scale type or lesion sites. We also randomly sampled 30 sets of scoring points covering different categories and evaluated their consistency with the medical encyclopedia (four levels: inconsistent, low, medium, and high). Of these, 24 sets are highly consistent, 4 are moder- ately consistent, and 1 shows low consistency. The lone low-consistency case is the lifestyle advice for roseola infantum: \u201cmaintain good personal hy- giene, wash hands frequently (seven-step method), avoid scratching the rash, and cleanse the skin with warm water, keeping it dry\u201d, which is not explicitly covered by the encyclopedia. Before the annotation tasks, we briefed the ex- perts on the diagnostic scope of the questions and ensured they possessed the necessary diagnostic knowledge. We provided a detailed explanation of our research objectives, experimental setup, and data usage, and explicitly obtained informed con- sent from all experts. A pilot annotation showed that the average annotation time per expert for both tasks was about 60 minutes, for which we pro- vided a remuneration of 100 RMB ($14) per expert. Data contains no protected information. Fig.5 dis- play the screenshot of the annotation platform and Fig.5 is its English translation. We use Gwet\u2019s AC1 (Gwet, 2008) as our agreement metric, as it is widely adopted (Chung et al., 2025; Qiu et al., 2025; Healey et al., 2025) and mitigates the adverse effects of imbalanced distributions. Results of all annotation tasks are detailed in Tab.3-4. C Computational Experiments Details Model Size And Budget. All open-source mod- els in our paper are executed (with vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023)) on a server with inference for the benchmark experiment finished in roughly 1 day. Tab.5 details the parameters of the open-source LLMs. For closed-source LLMs, we get responses via API calls. Descriptive Statistics. For the challenging, we utilize the boost-trap method described in Ap- pendix B.2 to conduct 10 sampling runs. Tab.6 reports the p-values, verified by a one-tailed t- test.

E Self-Recognition Experiment To further analyze the impact of Self-Recognition, we conduct experiments on DxBench (Chen et al., 2024a) and RJUA (Lyu et al., 2024). DxBench is a dataset covering 461 diseases and RJUA is is a urology QA dataset curated by domain experts. DxBench contains 1148 questions and RJUA con- tains 344 questions. For each dataset, we generate two new benchmarks using DouBao-Pro-32K-241215 (Vol- cEngine, 2025a) and DeepSeek-V3-241226 (Liu et al., 2024a), respectively. We analyze self- recognition by comparing the change in Top-1 di- agnostic accuracy across both benchmarks. We present the diagnostic accuracy of both models in Table 7. DxBench RJUA Model DeepSeek DouBao DeepSeek DouBao DouBao 25.98 22.66 36.62 38.07 DeepSeek 29.20 26.45 36.65 37.23 Table 7: Self-Recognition Analysis (via diagnostic ac- curacy). We observe that DouBao does not perform sig- nificantly better on the dataset it generated (e.g. 22.66 in DxBench-DouBao but 25.98 in DxBench- DeepSeek), and the performance gap between DouBao and DeepSeek remains similar (e.g. a gap of 3.22 in DxBench-DeepSeek and a gap of 3.79 in DxBench-DouBao) across both benchmarks. These observations illustrate that Self-Recognition\u2019s im- pact is not significant, as the model\u2019s performance does not improve significantly on the dataset it gen- erated. # dorg ddis Failure reason 1 Seborrheic dermatitis Scalp/facial psoriasis Scale type and lesion borders differ greatly; little overlap. 2 Tic disorder Wilson\u2019s disease Symptom profiles are clearly distinct. 3 Hypothyroidism Sleep-apnea syndrome Symptom profiles are clearly distinct. 4 Herpes zoster (shingles) Herpes simplex Lesion sites differ; minimal overlap expected.

Original: I have recently been experiencing a number of physical discomforts at the same time. First, I have noticeable sharp pain in both of my breasts; the pain level is approximately moderate, but it does not radiate to other areas. The pain did not occur particularly suddenly, and its location is not very precise. In addition, I have developed rapid breathing and difficulty breathing, accompanied by coughing, and the color of the sputum I cough up has changed and its volume has increased. Sometimes I also feel chills and shiver. My skin has developed pink rashes, with some areas showing swelling and peeling; the rashes are located on the back of my neck, behind my right ear, on the right side of my neck, on my left buttock, and on my left waist, but each rash is small, with a diameter of less than one centimeter. The rashes themselves are not very painful, only mildly uncomfortable, but the itching is quite pronounced, at a moderate level. Recently I have also often felt muscle aches all over my body, felt extremely fatigued, generally unwell, and my appetite has decreased significantly. It should be noted that I have a history of Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure; I have used bronchodilators, have had pneumonia, and underwent surgery in the past month. In addition, my weight has always been on the low side, with a BMI below 18.5. I have not traveled abroad in the last four weeks. May I ask what might be causing these symptoms? What examinations are needed or how should they be treated? Do I need to seek medical attention urgently? Ground-Truth Diagnosis: Pneumonia DeepSeek\u2019s Diagnosis: Pneumonia Self-Evolving: At present, I have moderate sharp pain in both breasts, the location is relatively clear, the onset is gradual, and it does not radiate to other areas. At the same time, I experience rapid and difficult breathing, persistent coughing, and I am able to cough up colored or increased amounts of sputum; I also occasionally shiver.

Additionally, I have whole-body muscle pain, poor appetite, a sharp reduction in food intake, extreme fatigue, general discomfort, and muscle soreness. I had surgery just last month and have had an ongoing cough problem. I have not traveled abroad in the past four weeks, and my body weight is low. May I ask what is causing these symptoms? Are they related to each other? How should they be treated and alleviated? Ground-Truth Diagnosis: Pneumonia DeepSeek\u2019s Diagnosis: Pneumonia DyVal2: Normally I like to go for walks in the park on weekends, usually walking for about an hour each time. Recently I also tried learning a new language, spending half an hour each day practicing. Within this daily activity context, I am currently feeling sharp pain in both breasts, at a moderate level, not radiating to other areas, with a relatively clear location and gradual onset. Meanwhile, I have rapid and difficult breathing, continuous coughing, and am able to cough up unusually colored or increased quantities of sputum, and occasionally shiver. I was previously diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart failure, have had pneumonia, suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and have used bronchodilators. Recently my skin has shown issues: small pink rashes on the back of my neck, behind my right ear, on the right side of my buttock, and on my left waist; the rashes may peel, are moderately swollen, lightly painful, each lesion is under one centimeter in diameter, and they are extremely itchy at a moderate level. In addition, I have whole-body muscle pain, no appetite, a large reduction in food intake, extreme fatigue, general discomfort, and muscle soreness. I had surgery last month and have been coughing all along. I have not traveled abroad in the past four weeks, and my weight is low (BMI under 18.5), with a recent slight decrease.

I also tend to feel dizzy and weak. The hospital diagnosed me with anemia, and the lab results showed that my fibrinogen levels are low. Based on my own research, I think it might be sideroblastic anemia, because this condition can also cause nosebleeds and anemia, and low fibrinogen levels seem to be related as well. In addition, I\u2019ve seen some social media posts saying that frequent sneezing is a sign of good health and that there\u2019s no need to worry about serious symptoms. Is my judgment reasonable? What other tests should I do, or how should I proceed next? Ground-Truth Diagnosis: Iron deficiency anemia GPT-4o\u2019s Response: AAccording to your description, combined with symptoms such as anemia, nosebleeds, dryness of the nasal cavity, dizziness, and fatigue, the preliminary consideration is that it may be iron-deficiency anemia or another type of anemia (such as aplastic anemia). Low fibrinogen may indicate abnormal coagulation function, but it is less directly associated with sideroblastic anemia. Sideroblastic anemia is relatively rare and is usually related to genetic factors or exposure to certain drugs or toxins; a bone marrow examination is required for diagnosis. Recommendations: 1. Further examinations: Complete blood count, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, vitamin B12, folic acid levels, and, if necessary, a bone marrow aspiration. 2. Nasal examination: Evaluation by an ENT specialist to assess the cause of nasal dryness and nosebleeds, and to rule out nasal inflammation or vascular abnormalities. 3. Coagulation function assessment: Including PT, APTT, D-dimer, etc., to clarify the reason for low fibrinogen. Management recommendations: \u2022 If iron-deficiency anemia is diagnosed, supplement with iron preparations (such as ferrous sulfate) and improve your diet (eat more red meat, animal liver, and dark green vegetables). \u2022 For nasal dryness, use saline spray or moisturizers. \u2022 Avoid overexertion and", "to clarify the reason for low fibrinogen. Management recommendations: \u2022 If iron-deficiency anemia is diagnosed, supplement with iron preparations (such as ferrous sulfate) and improve your diet (eat more red meat, animal liver, and dark green vegetables). \u2022 For nasal dryness, use saline spray or moisturizers. \u2022 Avoid overexertion and maintain a good daily routine. Frequent sneezing is not a sign of good health; it may be related to nasal dryness or allergies, and the cause should be clarified. Rating: 43.75 \u2013 Diagnosis Accuracy: score: 100 The response identifies iron deficiency anemia as the primary diagnosis, clearly stating it as the initial consideration, which aligns with the scoring criteria. \u2013 Veracity: score: 0 The model clearly states that frequent sneezing is not a sign of good health and may be related to nasal dryness or allergies, directly refuting the claim that more sneezing means better health. However, it does not address whether severe sneezing with breathing difficulty requires prompt medical attention. \u2013 Helpfulness: score: 50 Evidence Score: 50: The reply mentions dizziness and fatigue but does not specifically describe key diagnostic criteria such as pale skin and mucous membranes, weakness and tiredness, or neurological symptoms. It only gives a general overview and omits some important diagnostic details. Treatment Score: 50: The reply mentions iron supplementation and dietary improvements but does not address all key treatment recommendations, such as treating the underlying cause of iron deficiency or intravenous iron therapy, so some aspects are missing. Lifestyle Score: 50: The reply only suggests eating more red meat, animal liver, and dark green vegetables, but does not mention avoiding tea and coffee or supplementing vitamin C, so some key lifestyle advice is missing. \u2013 Consistency: score: 25 Allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis Iron Deficiency Anemia Pulmonary Hemorrhage-Nephritis Syndrome Table 12: GPT-4o\u2019s response on a question (about Iron Deficiency Anemia) from DyReMe.

Question: The same as Tab.12 Ground-Truth Diagnosis: Iron deficiency anemia WiNGPT2-9B\u2019s Response: Based on your described symptoms and test results, sideroblastic anemia is possible but requires further confirmation. Low fibrinogen levels may be related to anemia or underlying diseases. Frequent sneezing is not a sign of good health; it may be due to nasal dryness or allergies. If symptoms persist or worsen, you should seek medical attention promptly. It is recommended to undergo a bone marrow aspiration to clarify the type of anemia and to treat both the anemia and nasal dryness. Dizziness and fatigue should be addressed through appropriate anemia treatment to avoid delays. Please follow your doctor\u2019s advice and do not trust information from social media blindly. Rating: 25.00 \u2013 Diagnosis Accuracy: score: 0 The primary diagnosis in the response was sideroblastic anemia, with no mention of iron deficiency anemia. Although both are types of anemia, sideroblastic anemia is distinct from iron deficiency anemia, and the latter is the correct diagnosis for this case.

Therefore, the score is 0. \u2013 Veracity: score: 100 The model reply disagrees with the claim that frequent sneezing means better health and emphasizes that sneezing with other symptoms may indicate underlying issues. It also supports seeking medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen, which aligns with the advice to see a doctor for severe sneezing with breathing difficulties. \u2013 Helpfulness: score: 0 Evidence Score: 0: The response did not mention the core diagnostic criteria such as pallor of the skin and mucous membranes, fatigue and tiredness, or neurological symptoms. It only described the patient\u2019s chief complaints without analyzing these typical signs and symptoms in conjunction. As a result, the score is 0 points. Treatment Score: 0: The response only vaguely mentioned the possible need for iron supplements, vitamin B6, or other related treatments, without specifically addressing core treatment recommendations such as addressing the underlying cause, oral iron supplementation, or parenteral iron therapy. Therefore, the score is 0. Lifestyle Score: 0: The response only mentioned a balanced diet, drinking plenty of water, avoiding a dry nose, and getting adequate rest, but did not specifically address key lifestyle recommendations such as increasing iron-rich foods, avoiding tea and coffee, and supplementing with vitamin C.

However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Pro- cess Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLAR- ITY, a cost-effective RL framework that en- hances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARITY integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dy- namic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARITY improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic im- provements in coherence and professionalism.

However, in other do- mains such as law and medicine, high-quality train- ing data is often scarce. Available resources are typically limited to materials like professional qual- ification exams, where the predominant format is the multiple-choice question (MCQ). *Corresponding author. 1Our code is open sourced at: https://github.com/ Infinite-set/CLARity MCQ Data Policy Model Accuracy Reward Can\u2019t Distinguish Them!

Correct Ans with Random Guess Figure 1: Illustration of risks in MCQ RL: rewarding only answer correctness neglects reasoning supervision, which may weaken reasoning quality during training. Training using MCQ is usually effective, as their deterministic answers allow for clear outcome re- wards, which avoids the potential instability of training on open-ended tasks where a gold stan- dard answer is sometimes ambiguous (GLM et al., 2025; He et al., 2025; Weng, 2024). However, it also leads to certain risks, as focusing solely on the final choice accuracy provides no guarantee of a faithful and high-quality reasoning process. As a result, the model may learn to find correct answers through flawed heuristics or even random guess, rather than acquiring strong reasoning abilities. We conduct a pilot study training an LLM", "as focusing solely on the final choice accuracy provides no guarantee of a faithful and high-quality reasoning process. As a result, the model may learn to find correct answers through flawed heuristics or even random guess, rather than acquiring strong reasoning abilities. We conduct a pilot study training an LLM on a judicial examination MCQ dataset using standard outcome-based RL. As shown in Figure 2, while the final-answer accuracy significantly increases, the overall response quality progressively degrades. A typical manifestation of this quality decline is logical inconsistency. We find that the proportion of responses containing logical fallacies rises from 7% to 31%. This demonstrates that standard RL on MCQs not only fails to enhance reasoning qual- ity, but even also produce unreliable models that generate incomprehensible reasoning. Solving MCQ response quality issues is non- trivial. In domains like mathematics or code, the reasoning correctness can often be validated pro- grammatically by external verifiers such as the Python interpreter (Lei et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025). For domains lacking such verifiers, current 1 arXiv:2510.09278v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 studies relies on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to supervise reasoning. This approach, however, typically requiring either the use of large LLMs like GPT-4o as the PRM, or the fine-tuning of smaller LLMs on substantial high-quality, expert-annotated data (Chen et al., 2024a; Su et al., 2025). Both paths are resource-intensive, demanding significant budget or large expert-labeled corpora. To overcome these challenges, we intro- duce Consistency-aware Learning with Data- Augmented 2-Stage Reinforcement Strategy (CLARITY), a MCQ RL framework designed to en- hance response quality using only a small, general- purpose LLM, without requiring any further fine- tuning on the domain-specific data. CLARITY employs a consistency reward that assesses reasoning consistency within the response, penalizing incoherent outputs. And the reward is integrated into RL via a two-stage refine-then- monitor pipeline: Stage-1 refines the model\u2019s out- put to promote transparent, option-wise reasoning structure; Stage-2 relaxes format constraints and targets deeper reasoning, enhancing reasoning flex- ibility while preventing reward hacking. Addition- ally, to better exploit scarce data, CLARITY also apply a dynamic data reformulation strategy to im- prove data efficiency and overall training outcomes. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of CLARITY, which achieves improvements of 16.5% in response consistency and 7.5% in reli- able reasoning accuracy over standard RL base- lines. Human evaluations further confirm that by focusing solely on the simple signal of logical con- sistency, CLARITY produces models with holistic improvements that are not only more coherent but also exhibit greater professionalism and readabil- ity. Moreover, by eliminating the need for large- scale teacher LLMs or expert-annotated datasets, CLARITY offers a cost-effective and generalizable solution across domains, enabling smaller, general- purpose LLMs to effectively guide the training of expert models to achieve both higher accuracy and superior reasoning quality. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We identify MCQ RL can yield superficially accurate yet unreliable, internally inconsistent rea- soning.

We use the JEC-QA case-analysis dataset (Zhong et al., 2020) as the training data2, which focuses on deep legal analysis and problem-solving skills through multi-choice questions. Throughout the training process, we assess the quality using DeepSeek-V3. As shown in Figure 2, while the accuracy on final answer increases, we observe the overall response quality sharply degrades during training. Among those low-quality responses, a typical mode is logi- cal inconsistency between the thinking process and the final answer, which we find more than 30% of the model-generated responses exhibited such contradictions after training. These findings highlight that MCQ RL fails to enhance reasoning, producing models that reason unreliably and inconsistently. Given limited MCQ data resources without expert-annotation corpora or large PRM, we explore efficient strategies to address these challenges. 3 Methodology We propose Consistency-aware Learning with Data-Augmented 2-Stage Reinforcement Strategy (CLARity) to address response quality issues in MCQ RL. As shown in Figure 3, our approach in- tegrates a consistency-aware learning mechanism into the data-augmented refine-then-monitor rein- forcement pipeline. CLARITY enables smaller, general-purpose LLMs to guide expert model train- ing, improving both reasoning quality and accuracy.

Figure 3: Overview of CLARITY, an efficient MCQ RL framework that trains expert models using only small, general-purpose LLMs. It combines a consistency mechanism for detecting inconsistencies, a refine-then-monitor training pipeline for improving reasoning quality, and a dynamic data reformulation for maximizing data utility. 3.1 Consistency-Aware Learning Mechanism Our pilot study shows that outcome-based RL on MCQs fails to improve reasoning, often producing responses with severe inconsistencies. Moreover, fully supervising the reasoning process requires either large commercial LLMs or costly expert- annotated corpora, which are often unavailable. Here, we explore another strategy to address the quality issue on MCQ RL, leveraging the consis- tency of model\u2019s judgments for each candidate op- tion in its thinking trajectory as a reward signal. This is because a high-quality response must not only provide the correct final answer but also ac- curately judge the validity of each option, making consistency a useful proxy for reasoning reliability. Specifically, our consistency-aware reward mechanism begins by separating the model\u2019s re- sponses into two parts: the reasoning trajectory and the final answer. We then employ a separate, small general-purpose LLM as the consistency reward model, tasked with identifying the believed-correct options that the model endorses through its rea- soning. A penalty is assigned if either the reward model fails to identify clear option judgments from the reasoning or the believed-correct options in the reasoning do not match the model\u2019s final answer. By penalizing such failures, our mechanism guides the model", "options that the model endorses through its rea- soning. A penalty is assigned if either the reward model fails to identify clear option judgments from the reasoning or the believed-correct options in the reasoning do not match the model\u2019s final answer. By penalizing such failures, our mechanism guides the model toward more coherent and reliable rea- soning. A key advantage of this mechanism is its min- imal requirement for domain knowledge. The re- ward model only needs to comprehend basic cor- rectness judgments (e.g., \"Option A is correct,\" \"B is invalid because ...\") within the response, which relies on fundamental semantic understanding, a ca- pability already possessed by most general-purpose LLMs. Thus, expert-level models are unnecessary. Moreover, although our method focuses narrowly on logical coherence, we observe broader improve- ments in the holistic reasoning proficiency. See discussions in Section 5.5. 3.2 Data-Augmented Two-Stage Training We introduce a two-stage refine-then-monitor pipeline to effectively integrate our consistency- aware reward into RL training. Additionally, to better exploit limited MCQ data, we propose a dy- namic data reformulation strategy to improve data utilization and overall training outcomes. 2-Stage Refine-then-Monitor Training We in- tegrate the proposed consistency reward into train- ing process by a two-stage refine-then-monitor pipeline, which progressively improves consistency while preserving in-depth reasoning. In stage-1, we refine the model\u2019s output structure by encouraging option-wise reasoning, without considering the an- swer correctness. We apply regular expressions to identify and reward responses that analyze one op- tion at a time, thus encouraging the model to explic- itly state correctness judgments in reasoning. This ensures that responses remain LLM-friendly for accurate checking by reward models, and prevents reward hacking \u2014 if the model fails to present explicit judgments, the consistency reward model cannot reliably detect inconsistencies, which risks pushing the model toward overly superficial and simplified reasoning (Chen et al., 2025). Further discussion of this issue is provided in Section 5.4. In stage 2, we monitor the model\u2019s responses using our proposed consistency reward model, and 3 eliminate the requirement for response structure in stage-1 to avoid overfitting and encourage flexible reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate the answer reward in stage-2 to optimize answer correctness. We design a strict reward mechanism that provides positive feedback only when the model selects ex- actly all the correct options and assigns zero reward in all other cases, which largely reduces the pos- sibility of shortcut-based solutions during training and compels the model to develop a deeper reason- ing. And a fixed format reward is applied in both stages, ensuring the model generates output within <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> tags. Dynamic data reformulation Gradually remov- ing easy instances and introducing harder in- stances during training can enhance model perfor- mance (An et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b). Given the scarcity of high-quality train- ing data, we employ a data augmentation method that does not require additional datasets. Instead, it refines too-easy data through deconstruction and re- formulation to maximize data utility, curating more challenging and diverse data without the need for domain expertise. Specifically, we first deconstruct each training", "scarcity of high-quality train- ing data, we employ a data augmentation method that does not require additional datasets. Instead, it refines too-easy data through deconstruction and re- formulation to maximize data utility, curating more challenging and diverse data without the need for domain expertise. Specifically, we first deconstruct each training instance into independent propositions by convert- ing each candidate option into an atom statement through string concatenation of the original query statement and the option. The correctness of each proposition is determined by checking if the corre- sponding option is correct in the original problem. Next we refine these propositions using the LLM, polishing ill-formed phrasing for fluency and intro- ducing fictional names and places to further diver- sify the data. See Appendix C.2 for data examples. During training, based on the initial pass rate, we create new questions by dynamically reformulating the easiest \u03b1 proportion of the original instances through randomly grouping, with answers derived from the correctness of each proposition and state- ments generated using predefined templates (e.g., \"Which of the following statements are correct?\"). The remaining (1\u2212\u03b1) instances remain unchanged. By gradually increasing \u03b1, we progressively elim- inate overly simple instances, transforming them into more challenging examples that promote better learning. This strategy offers an efficient and effec- tive way to adjust the difficulty of training data and enhance training outcomes. 4 Experimental Setup Datasets We focus specifically on two domains: law and medicine, where large-scale professional- level datasets exist solely in multiple-choice ques- tion (MCQ) format. We believe the observations from these areas are generalizable to other fields. For legal reasoning, we use the JEC-QA case- analysis dataset (Zhong et al., 2020), which require deep legal analysis and reasoning in complex sce- narios rather than rote memorization (Patterson, 1951). The dataset contains 10,561 case-analysis MCQs, split into 80% for training and 20% for vali- dation. For medical reasoning, we use the MedQA- USMLE dataset (Jin et al., 2020), which evaluates a physician\u2019s ability to analyze medical concepts, ap- ply principles and reason across multiple pieces of evidence. It contains 10,178 MCQs in the training set and 1,272 MCQs for validation. Evaluation For in-domain validations, we report the ratio of correct and consistent instances (Acc+ for abbreviation). This metric better reflects the model\u2019s true problem-solving ability, as it distin- guishes genuine reasoning from superficial heuris- tics or random guessing. Additionally, we report the consistency ratio and the accuracy based only on the final generated answer (measured by exact match). We also evaluate the model\u2019s generalizability on out-of-domain open-ended benchmarks covering different topics. For legal reasoning, we use LexE- val (Li et al., 2025a) open-ended tasks, focusing on legal question answering and summary generation. For medical reasoning, we use PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), consisting of open-ended questions derived from biomedical research in PubMed. We employ Rouge-L as the evaluation metric for both benchmarks. Implementation Details We use both Qwen- 2.5-3B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) as the backbone model, resulting in CLARITY3B and CLARITY7B respectively. We use Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct for the initial pass rate and the consistency reward calculation.", "biomedical research in PubMed. We employ Rouge-L as the evaluation metric for both benchmarks.

When combining data reformulation with the pipeline, we apply it only in Stage-2, where we start with the original data and begin to reformulate at step 100 with \u03b1 = 0.5. See Appendix C.1 for more training details. 5 Results and Analysis 5.1 Main Results We report the main results in Table 1. Baselines, in- cluding standard RL and PRM RL, show degraded reasoning consistency across both domains, con- firming the risks of applying RL to MCQs and the limitations of using small LLMs directly as PRMs. In contrast, CLARITY achieves substantial gains in both consistency and accuracy. Moreover, CLARITY shows strong general- izability, with consistent gains on diverse unseen open-ended tasks. We further validate this by trans- forming the original validation set into two alterna- tive formats with unchanged content: (1) Iterative Judgment (Iter.), where each option is judged inde- pendently, and (2) Shuffled MCQ (Shuf.), where options are recombined using the method in Sec- tion 3.2. Because options in the original MCQs are often correlated, so identifying one correct choice may suffice to solve the whole question. The new formats block such shortcuts to better", "option is judged inde- pendently, and (2) Shuffled MCQ (Shuf.), where options are recombined using the method in Sec- tion 3.2. Because options in the original MCQs are often correlated, so identifying one correct choice may suffice to solve the whole question. The new formats block such shortcuts to better test reasoning ability. As shown in Table 2, CLARITY maintains superior performance across both, which we attribute to our data reformulation strategy, as more diverse data usually leads to better general- ization (Huang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). Human evaluations confirm that CLARITY im- proves holistic reasoning quality, yielding better professionalism and readability. This shows that small general-purpose LLMs can effectively guide expert model training by monitoring consistency, producing models that even surpass large commer- cial systems like GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024a). 5.2 How Does CLARITY Boost Reasoning? In this section, we explore the underlying causes of the inconsistency, and identify the key reason for the improvement brought by the consistency-aware learning paradigm in CLARITY framework. How can inconsistency affect reasoning? To better understand the mechanisms behind incon- sistency, we categorize the phenomenon into three types: OVER EXCLUSION occurs when the rea- soning process excludes all available option, yet the final answer selects some options it has just dismissed, suggesting that the model is able to con- sistently rule out all incorrect options, but it strug- gles to identify the correct one. OVER SELECTION arises when the LLM identifies multiple options as plausible in its reasoning, but the final answer contains only a partial subset of them. This points to the model can successfully identify and validate all the correct options but fails to verbalize the exclusion of some wrong options. DISSOCIATED ANSWER represents where the reasoning process 5 0 100 200 300 Training Steps 0 100 200 300 Instance Num Standard RL 0 100 200 300 Training Steps 0 100 200 300 Instance Num CLARity Over Exclusion Over Selection Dissociated Answer Figure 4: Training dynamics of three inconsistency types on Jec-QA validation set.

This indicates a severe breakdown between the intermediate reasoning and the final answer generation, indicating that the process of excluding irrelevant options and identifying the an- swers are both unreliable. Vanilla RL training confuses the model\u2019s deci- sion in excluding incorrect options, and causes hesitation on more harder tasks. Building upon our taxonomy, we now analyze how these inconsistencies evolve during training. We use DeepSeek-V3 as the annotator to track the outputs from the model undergoing standard RL training. As shown in Figure 4, the breakdown by type shows that the overall increase in inconsistencies is pri- marily driven by a significant rise in OVER SELEC- TION and DISSOCIATED ANSWER cases, while the OVER EXCLUSION case", "the annotator to track the outputs from the model undergoing standard RL training. As shown in Figure 4, the breakdown by type shows that the overall increase in inconsistencies is pri- marily driven by a significant rise in OVER SELEC- TION and DISSOCIATED ANSWER cases, while the OVER EXCLUSION case increase only marginally, suggesting that the primary failure is the model\u2019s growing reluctance to exclude wrong cases. More- over, when examining consistency alongside accu- racy (Table 3), we find that responses to incorrectly- answered questions exhibit much lower consistency than those correct ones. This suggests that standard RL makes the model more hesitant when facing difficult questions, failing to perform complex rea- soning and thus offering very limited improvement in its actual reasoning capability.

StrMatch denotes assigning a reward only when the generated answer exactly matches the ground truth. CLARITY sharpens the model\u2019s capacity to ex- clude incorrect choices. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 3, by monitoring response consistency during training, all three types of inconsistency show a significant decrease compared to vanilla RL training, confirming our approach\u2019s effective- ness, especially in sharpening the model\u2019s capacity to exclude incorrect choices compared to the stan- dard RL. We attribute these improvements to two key components: the consistency-aware learning mechanism (see discussion below) and the data reformulation pipeline (see Appendix D.1). 5.3 Can Small Models Guide Experts? Training expert-level LLMs typically requires large models like GPT-4 or additional training to aug- ment domain knowledge (Chen et al., 2024a; Su et al., 2025). These methods are resource-intensive, requiring considerable financial investment or huge amount of expert-annotated data. We investigate whether smaller, general-purpose LLMs can effec- tively guide the training for expert model. Small-scale LLMs fail as PRM. We first exam- ine whether smaller open-source LLMs (Qwen2.5- 7B-Instruct) can directly serve as the PRM, moni- toring the reasoning process with the same instruc- tions used for larger models. Responses are re- warded only if they are free from any possible error. As shown in Table 4, we observe two key points. First, treating questions as open-ended generation yields significantly lower accuracy, demonstrating that the non-deterministic nature of open-ended an- swers leads ineffective training. MCQs, with clear and deterministic answer, can provide more sta- ble and generalizable improvements. Second, the 7B model fail to serve as an effective MCQ PRM, 6 leading to results substantially inferior to CLAR- ITY. This is likely due to a combination of limited domain expertise and inadequate model capacity, which together constrain its ability to accurately assess reasoning quality. CLARITY enables guidance via monitoring con- sistency. It introduces a consistency-aware learn- ing paradigm, allowing smaller LLMs to monitor response consistency in MCQs. As shown in Ta- ble 4, using", "a combination of limited domain expertise and inadequate model capacity, which together constrain its ability to accurately assess reasoning quality. CLARITY enables guidance via monitoring con- sistency. It introduces a consistency-aware learn- ing paradigm, allowing smaller LLMs to monitor response consistency in MCQs. As shown in Ta- ble 4, using only a 7B-scale LLM as its consistency checker, CLARITY significantly outperforms stan- dard RL and PRM methods, and successfully cul- tivates an expert model with superior reasoning quality and accuracy. Further human evaluations in Section 5.5 confirm that CLARITY exhibit greater professionalism in their reasoning and are easier for readers to understand. These results demonstrate that small LLMs, when used to monitor consis- tency, can effectively curate expert LLMs. We further investigate whether tiny-sized LLMs (\u22641.5B, deployable on consumer-grade GPUs) can also monitor reasoning consistency. First, we benchmark their inconsistency detection abil- ity against DeepSeek-V3 as a proxy for ground truth3. The detection rates are substantially lower for tiny LLMs: 21% for Qwen2.5-0.5B and 40% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, compared to 94% for the 7B model. This indicates that the foundational seman- tic capabilities of these tiny models are insufficient even for the simpler consistency-checking task. Then we experiment with Qwen2.5-1.5B as the consistency reward model within the CLARITY framework, as shown in Figure 5, using tiny-sized reward models results in poorer response quality, as they encourage simpler, more superficial outputs that the weak consistency checker can easily parse, potentially leading to reward hacking. 5.4 How to Mitigate Reward Hacking? Reward hacking may occur when tiny-sized LLMs are used as reward models, as their limited capac- ity prevents them from detecting inconsistencies. LLMs with relatively larger size, such as the 7B models, can identify inconsistencies, but they may still lack domain-specific knowledge, preventing them from distinguishing between substantive rea- soning and superficially plausible shortcuts, which can also result in reward hacking. We propose a 2-stage refine-then-monitor pipeline in CLARITY 3We validate the reliability of using DeepSeek-V3 as a proxy for ground truth in Appendix B. 83.1% 16.7% W/o Stage-1 72.9% 26.5% Using 1.5B RM 67.7% 32.2% Vanilla Qwen 59.8% 39.3% W/o Stage-1 68.1% 30.5% Using 1.5B RM 59.5% 40.0% Vanilla Qwen Law Med CLARity Wins CLARity Loses Figure 5: Reasoning quality comparison between CLARITY and different baselines: without Stage-1, using Qwen-1.5B as the consistency reward model, and the vanilla Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. 0 100 200 300 Training Steps 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Instance Num As-A-Whole Num 0 100 200 300 Training Steps 100 150 200 250 300 # Tokens Average Response Len CLARity W/o Stage-1 Figure 6: Training dynamics of as-a-whole response frequency and response length. In CLARITY, the first 15 steps correspond to Stage-1. to mitigate this, which we evaluate through experi- ments to demonstrate its necessity. Refine-then-monitor pipeline offers flexible rea- soning and avoids hacking. Our 2-stage refine- then-monitor pipeline first encourages explicit rea- soning for each option and then uses a consistency reward model to monitor the responses. We catego- rize the responses into two types based on the ob- served patterns in model reasoning. Explicit: The reasoning includes an explicit", "and avoids hacking. Our 2-stage refine- then-monitor pipeline first encourages explicit rea- soning for each option and then uses a consistency reward model to monitor the responses. We catego- rize the responses into two types based on the ob- served patterns in model reasoning. Explicit: The reasoning includes an explicit and detailed analy- sis of options, typically appears in complex ques- tions requiring diverse knowledge. As-a-Whole: The reasoning is generalized and presented without itemizing options, often uses in simpler questions requiring minimal thought. As shown in Figure 6, in stage-1, the number of As-a-Whole responses decreases as we incentivize a transparent and structured format, making the reasoning process legible and easy for the consis- tency checker to evaluate accurately. In stage-2, we remove this structural constraint and monitor re- sponse quality with the consistency reward. We ob- serve a gradual increase in As-a-Whole responses, 7 which finally stabilizes. This demonstrates that the model has not merely memorized a format but has learned to flexibly apply the appropriate reason- ing pattern based on task complexity, achieving consistently high-quality outputs. Ablating the pipeline leads to reward hacking. To prove the necessity of our design, we ablated the pipeline by removing the first stage, applying the reward LLM throughout the training. We assess response quality using LLM-as-a-Judge (Gu et al., 2025), evaluating answer rationality, professional- ism, coherence, clarity, and ease of understanding. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, removing the first stage leads to a significant degradation in response quality with much shorter responses. This is be- cause the trained model quickly learns that simpler, more superficial reasoning is preferred. And it may even attempt to conceal complex reasoning to avoid penalties, resulting in reward hacking. This hypoth- esis is further supported by the statistic in Figure 6, where the number of As-a-Whole responses sig- nificantly increases in training, indicating that the model increasingly favor over-simplified reason- ing, even when the questions demand substantial analysis. See Appendix E for case study and Ap- pendix D.3 for further ablation on reward models. 5.5 Human Evaluation We further demonstrate that CLARITY can im- prove the overall response quality beyond reason- ing consistency through human evaluation. Evaluation Metrics For both law and medicine, We recruit an expert who have passed profession examination to assess the quality of responses in 50 random samples from validation set. We estab- lish three evaluation criteria focusing on different aspects, and can represent the overall quality when combined altogether: Correctness (Corr.), Profes- sionalism (Prof.), Readability (Read.). We use a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 represents \"very poor\" and 5 represents \"very good\". CLARITY improves professionalism and read- ability. The results in Table 5 show that CLAR- ITY consistently achieves higher average scores than the vanilla RL model, demonstrating its effec- tiveness in enhancing overall reasoning quality by monitoring reasoning consistency.

By rewarding accuracy and format, these methods achieve significant improvement across benchmarks in mathematics (Hu et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025), logic (Xie et al., 2025), code generation (Hugging- Face, 2025) and multi-hop QA (Song et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025). However, few studies have adapt RL to other domains with only MCQ data available such as law and medicine (Chen et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2025), where the clar- ity of the responses can\u2019t be guaranteed. We are the first to analyze the effectiveness of RL training in these domains from the perspective of response quality, focusing on logical consistency. LLM Reasoning Consistency refers to whether the model\u2019s observed reasoning accurately reflects its internal thinking. Many studies highlights LLM consistency as a bottleneck in various settings, including incoherent logical reasoning (Kirchner et al., 2024; Ferreira et al., 2025; Arcuschin et al., 2025), resistance to verbalizing hints (Chen et al., 2025) or deliberately concealing its true capabili- ties (Meinke et al., 2025). To improve consistency, current research typically employs two ways: con- structing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data (Chen et al., 2024b; Paul et al., 2024; Ferreira et al., 2025; Chua et al., 2025), and filtering low- quality outputs during training (Wang et al., 2025b; Kirchner et al., 2024; Baker et al., 2025). Our work, focusing on improving data quality and dynam- ically rewarding high-quality responses, extends these approaches with the context of RL training. 8 7 Conclusion We identify MCQ RL often produces superfi- cially accurate yet inconsistent reasoning. We introduce CLARITY, an efficient RL frame- work that addresses this issue by guiding the ex- pert model through consistency-aware refine-then- monitor training. Our method improves data uti- lization and delivers holistic enhancements in rea- soning quality, including accuracy, professionalism, and readability, all without relying on large com- mercial models or expert-annotated corpora, thus offering a cost-effective and generalizable solution. Limitations Limited Exploration of Data Augmentation Ap- proach Although this work demonstrates the ef- fectiveness of our proposed data reformulation strategy, its exploration remains relatively limited. In particular, in this paper, we do not fully exploit its potential flexibility\u2014for example, dynamically varying the number of candidate options per ques- tion, or mixing data from multiple distinct domains to create more diverse and challenging training samples. We believe these directions hold promise for further improving generalization and encourage future work to investigate them using our proposed data", "its potential flexibility\u2014for example, dynamically varying the number of candidate options per ques- tion, or mixing data from multiple distinct domains to create more diverse and challenging training samples. We believe these directions hold promise for further improving generalization and encourage future work to investigate them using our proposed data reformulation strategy further. Training-Time Overhead In addition, while our CLARITY framework only relies on a relatively small 7B LLM as the consistency reward model, this still introduces substantial training-time over- head (from about 8 hours without reward modeling to \u22651 day with it). A more efficient alternative would be to replace the LLM reward model with a lightweight encoder such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). However, this would require large-scale, high-quality labeled data to train these smaller models to perform rea- soning comprehension and identify the model\u2019s believed-correct options\u2014data that is currently dif- ficult and costly to obtain. We therefore leave this as a promising direction for future research.

N denote the total num- ber of instances in the training dataset D, and M the number of candidate options for each multiple-choice question. Each problem instance Ii = (Qi, Ci, Ansi) \u2208D consists of a query statement Qi and M candidate options Ci := {Ci1, Ci2, . . . , CiM}, with an answer Ai \u2286Ci, Ai can be any subset of Ci, including the full set and the empty set.

The annotators are informed of how the data would be used. B.1 Model-Human Agreement First we examine the effectiveness of our consis- tency reward model. We recruit a graduate pro- ficient in English and Chinese, and provide him with", "evaluation. The annotator\u2019s payment is adequate given the partici- pants\u2019 demographic. The annotators are informed of how the data would be used. B.1 Model-Human Agreement First we examine the effectiveness of our consis- tency reward model. We recruit a graduate pro- ficient in English and Chinese, and provide him with a sample of 100 instances from the validation set for each domain, use the model trained with vanilla RL to generate response, and ask him to evaluate the consistency between reasoning trajec- tory and answer. The Pearson correlation coeffi- cient between human and DeepSeek-V3 is 0.610 with p = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221210 averaged on two domains, demonstrating LLMs can effectively detect incon- sistencies, with a relatively high correlation be- tween model and human. B.2 Quality Evaluation Training Data Quality Evaluation We conduct human evaluation on training data to further vali- date its quality. We randomly sample 50 samples from the augmented dataset obtained from Algo- rithm 1 for each domain, and examine whether the data quality from two aspects: whether the state- ment natural, fluent, and easy for humans to un- derstand, and whether the key information in the content between the propositions and original data is the same (i.e. The augmented problem is a well- defined reformulation of the original problem.) We find all 50 samples are well-presented without any incoherence, and 49 in 50 samples maintains all the key information compared with the original data. See Appendix C.2 for training dataset examples. All training data are used in accordance with their original intent and licenses. Response Quality Evaluation We provide the details of evaluation metrics below. See evaluation results and discussion in Section 5.5. Correctness (5 points): Focuses on whether the reasoning and conclusions are logically sound and internally consistent. The emphasis is on logical validity rather than domain-specific factual preci- sion. Professionalism (5 points): Evaluates the accu- racy and appropriateness of the domain knowledge used. The key concern is whether the cited knowl- edge is correct and meaningfully contributes to the reasoning process. Readability (5 points): Assesses how clearly and smoothly the response can be read and understood, reflecting overall coherence and linguistic fluency. C More Implementation Details C.1 Training Configuration When using our proposed 2-stage training pipeline with consistency reward, for all experiments we uniformly samples 500 instances from the train- ing dataset for stage 1, training for 2 epochs with only answer reward and format reward, and use the rest instances for stage-2 training, with 8 epochs using our consistency reward, answer reward and format reward. Additionally, we change the train- ing data into our shuffled and diversified dataset in stage-2 training after 100 steps when using our data augmentation approach. The training was conducted on a single node equipped with 8 A800 GPUs using the veRL li- brary (Sheng et al., 2025). The key training con- figuration is shown below in Table 6. The detailed reward weight is listed in Table 7. Note that we do not conduct hyperparameter searching, so the current performance is underoptimal, and has the potential of further imperovement.

C.2 Prompt and Dataset Example Data Augmentation We provide the prompts used in augmenting the original dataset, and the instance example of the original dataset and the augmented dataset. The original dataset example of Jec-QA is shown in Table 12, and MedQA in Table 13. Then we concatenate the original state- ment with options and conduct polish and diversify using LLM.

The final data example after our pipeline is shown in Table 14 and Table 15. 2-stage Consistency Training and Evaluation During 2-stage consistency training, we use a spe- cial reward model to monitor the CoT consistency. We use 3-shot in-context learning to instruct the LLM to parse the believed-correct options in the CoT using the Vllm library (Kwon et al., 2023). The prompt for the consistency reward model is shown in Table 10. We also provide the LLM-as-a- judge prompt used in evaluating the quality of the generated CoTs in Table 11. D Additional Experimental Results D.1 Ablation Study on Data Reformulation As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the proposed dynamic data reformulation approach significantly improves model accuracy across various formats and content. We conduct ablations to assess the impact of: (1) LLM-based diversified data refine- ment (training with only string-level concatenated data), and (2) pass-rate-based reformulation (us- ing original data without reformulation, or using randomly deconstructed data). The results, shown in Table D.1, reveal that removing LLM-based re- finements decreases performance, underscoring the importance of using LLMs to eliminate redundant Phase ValueT rue ValueF alse Weight Answer Reward Vanilla RL 1.0 0.0 1.0 stage 2 1.0 0.0 1.0 Format Reward Vanilla RL 1.0 0.0 1.0 stage 1 1.0 0.0 1.0 stage 2 0.0 -1.0 0.1 Structure Reward Stage-1 1.0 0.0 1.0 Consistency Reward Stage-2 0.0 -1.0 1.0 Table 7: Reward weights.

Additionally, reformulating easy data during training yields the best performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method and supporting prior work on introduc- ing more challenging instances in RL training (An et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b). Notably, consistency also improves with refor- mulation compared to standard RL, suggesting that curating more challenging data mitigates inconsis- tency, as tasks requiring complex reasoning natu- rally encourage models to reason more effectively. D.2 Detailed Training Dynamics We present the more detailed dynamics in RL train- ing. In Figures 7 and 8, we report the log of rewards during training, including the answer reward, the consistency reward and the format reward. D.3 Results For Rule-Based Consistency Reward Model We explore the feasibility of using a rule-based con- sistency reward model that leverages exact pattern matching of regular expressions. We find using the rule-based consistency reward results in a performance drop of 11.4% in answer 13 Figure 7: Training dynamics of CLARITY in Stage-1. Figure 8: Training dynamics of CLARITY in Stage-2. accuracy on the validation set, and shows almost no improvement in out-of-domain tasks. The rule- based approach forces the model to generate re- sponses with a fixed format designed to match pre- defined patterns rather than encouraging deeper reasoning, which makes the model more prone to overfitting during training, producing shorter re- sponses that overly focused on matching the regular expression. E Case Study We present case studies from both domains in Ta- ble 16 and Table 17. The vanilla Qwen2.5-7B- Instruct model already demonstrates basic legal and medical reasoning capabilities, allowing it to perform limited analytical reasoning. However, its accuracy remains low, often relying on incorrect or incomplete knowledge. Moreover, its responses contain redundant and shallow analyses, suggesting that the distilled reasoning patterns it learned are largely superficial\u2014capturing only surface struc- tures rather than genuine problem-understanding or reasoning depth. After reinforcement learning, the model\u2019s ac- curacy improves. However, as illustrated in the tables, the standard outcome-based RL introduces inconsistencies: the model may reject a candidate option during reasoning but later select it as the final answer. This inconsistency highlights that outcome-based rewards alone are insufficient to ensure high-quality reasoning. CLARITY address this issue through a consistency-aware mechanism that explicitly mon- itors reasoning alignment between intermediate judgments and final conclusions. Additionally, its two-stage refine-then-monitor pipeline further en- hances response quality, mitigating potential re- ward hacking that arises when small-scale reward models fail to detect inconsistencies. When the refine-then-monitor stage is removed (W/o Stage-1 in the tables), reasoning quality significantly de- clines, as the model tends to favor oversimplified reasoning patterns even for questions requiring sub- stantial analytical depth. 14 Data Polishing Prompt Template I am a {legal/medical} school professor preparing final exam questions for my {legal/medical} course.

I would like to design a statement analysis question, where students are required to judge whether the given statement is correct and provide supporting reasoning. To do this, I select a question stem from my multiple-choice question bank and combine it with one of its answer options to transform it into a statement for analysis. However, the stem may still contain phrasing specific to multiple-choice format (e.g., \u201cWhich of the following is . . . ?\u201d) or redundant punctuation, and may result in illogical reasoning. Therefore, I need your help to polish the statement: remove any phrasing related to multiple-choice format, adjust sentence structure or add connecting words if necessary, and ensure that the final version is logically coherent and easy to understand. You should also diversify the statement by adjusting word order, replacing synonyms or conjunctions, or introducing fictional names and places that do not alter the meaning. This will help diversify the question bank. Please enclose the polished statement within curly braces. {Examples} Original statement: {Original_statement} Table 9: Prompt for dynamic data reformulation.

Under the Regulations on Emergency Response to Public Health Emergencies, the school\u2019s action of reporting to the municipal health bureau within two hours after the incident complies with legal requirements. B. A department store (Party A) and a TV manufacturer (Party B) had a payment dispute, and Party B then refused to supply goods to Party A. When a customer asked the store\u2019s salesperson whether the store carried Party B\u2019s televisions, the salesperson deliberately stated: \u201cParty B\u2019s prod- ucts are substandard and have a high repair rate. To protect consumers\u2019 interests, our store has refused to sell Party B\u2019s products.\u201d", "refused to supply goods to Party A.

C. Zhao borrowed a mobile phone from Chen. Later, when Chen asked for it back, Zhao claimed he had already returned it, leading to a dispute. Chen sued in the town-level people\u2019s court, which tried the case under the summary procedure. The court pronounced the judgment in court and told the parties to come and collect the written judgment themselves, stating that the court would not effect service. According to the relevant laws, this practice is correct. D. Sunshine Technology Co. and Starlight Manufacturing Co. entered into an arbitration agreement regarding their equipment-processing contract, stipulating that any disputes arising during performance of the contract shall be submitted to the local arbitration commission for arbitration. Dur- ing performance, a dispute arose and Sunshine Technology directly sued Starlight Manufacturing in court. Starlight did not raise a jurisdictional objection with the court within the statutory period. In the course of the proceedings, Sunshine Technology produced a complete chain of evidence and Starlight faced the risk of losing; only then did Starlight submit the previously concluded arbitration agreement to the court. Upon review, the court determined that the arbitration agreement was not legally valid. In this situation, the court should continue hearing the case. Table 14: Data example of Jec-QA after applying our augmentation. Question: Which of the following statements are wrong: Options: A: A startup is working on a novel project in which they claim they can replicate the organelle that is defective in MELAS syndrome. If their project is to mimic the metabolic processes of this organelle, they must be able to replicate fatty acid synthesis. B: Researchers are experimenting with hormone levels in mice in fasting and fed states. To test hormone levels in the fed state, the mice are given an oral glucose load and various hormones are measured in a blood sample. Researchers are most interested in the hormone whose blood levels track evenly with C-peptide levels. Based on the experimental setup, the hormone the researchers are most interested in is responsible for fatty acid breakdown in the body. C: James is a 23-year-old man residing in Boston who presents to his physician for evaluation of progressive hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus in his right ear over the past six months. During physical examination, multiple soft, yellowish plaques and papules are noted on his arms, chest, and back. Audiometric testing reveals sensorineural hearing loss, and neurological examination demonstrates bilateral facial muscle weakness along with an unsteady gait. Brain MRI reveals two masses: a 3-cm lesion near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. Given these clinical and imaging findings, the abnormal cells comprising these masses are most", "and neurological examination demonstrates bilateral facial muscle weakness along with an unsteady gait. Brain MRI reveals two masses: a 3-cm lesion near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. Given these clinical and imaging findings, the abnormal cells comprising these masses are most likely derived from the neural tube. D: Emma is a 45-year-old woman with a known history of hypertension and bipolar disorder. She visits your clinic today due to new-onset tremors, along with complaints of intense thirst and frequent urination. While her bipolar disorder had been well-controlled with her previous medication regimen, she recently introduced a new drug. Given the symptoms she is experiencing, the medication she most likely started is valproate. E: A 27-year-old man is running on the treadmill at his gym. His blood pressure prior to beginning his workout was 110/72. Based on the physiological response to exercise, a decreased heart rate may be seen in this man now that he is exercising.

According to Article 142 of the Contract Law, the risk of damage or loss of the subject matter is borne by the seller before delivery and by the buyer after delivery, unless otherwise specified by law. Here, Company A and Company B orally agreed that Company B retains ownership of the equipment until Company A pays, so ownership remains with Company B until payment. According to Article 142, the risk of destruction is borne by Company B. Option A is incorrect, and option B is correct. According to Article 167 of the Contract Law, a retention of title agreement must be registered to be enforceable against bona fide third parties. Since the agreement was not in writing, it cannot be asserted against a bona fide third party. Therefore, option D is correct. As the risk of destruction is borne by Company B, Company A does not need to pay the original price.

In this case, there is a sales contract between Company A and Company B, with an oral agreement that Company B retains ownership of the equipment until Company A pays. Therefore, after delivery, the risk is borne by Company A. However, as the equipment was destroyed, the issue of ownership needs to be clarified. According to Article 134 of the Contract Law, the parties may agree that ownership remains with the seller if the buyer fails to pay the price or fulfill other obligations. Therefore, the retention of ownership agreement is valid. However, since the equipment is destroyed, its value no longer exists, and Company A does not need to pay the original price.

According to Article 141 of the Contract Law, after the seller delivers the subject matter, the risk is generally borne by the buyer. However, in this case, Company A and Company B have a special agreement that Company B retains ownership of the equipment until Company A pays. Therefore, according to Article 142 of the Contract Law, the risk of damage or loss is borne by the buyer after delivery, unless otherwise specified by law or agreed by the parties. In this case, the risk is borne by Company A, so Option A is correct, and Option B is incorrect. According to Article 147 of the Contract Law, if the buyer has not paid the price after the risk of damage or loss occurs, the seller has the right to demand full payment or compensation for the damage or loss. Therefore, even if the equipment is destroyed, Company A must still pay the original price, so Option C is correct. According to Article 167 of the Contract Law, if the seller retains ownership, the period of retention must be agreed upon with the buyer.

Red part contains inconsis- tency. 19 Question: Question: A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with joint pain. He states that since yesterday he has had joint pain, and today he noticed a rash. The patient does not have a significant past medical history. The patient smokes cigars, drinks 1 to 4 drinks per day, is sexually active, and uses cocaine occasionally. His temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/65 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals pustular skin lesions and an inflamed and painful right knee that is warm to the touch. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for the most likely diagnosis? Answer: B Options: A: Azithromycin B: Cefixime and azithromycin C: Ceftriaxone D: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin E: Piperacillin and tazobactam Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct <think> To determine the most appropriate treatment, we need to consider the patient\u2019s symptoms and the likely diagnosis. The patient presents with joint pain and a rash, which could indicate a variety of conditions, but the presence of pustular skin lesions and an inflamed, warm, and painful knee suggests a possible bacterial infection, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, which can present with these symptoms. - **Azithromycin (A)**: This is an antibiotic commonly used for chlamydia and other bacterial infections. However, it may not be sufficient for a more severe infection like gonorrhea. - **Cefixime and azithromycin (B)**: Cefixime is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those causing gonorrhea. Azithromycin is also included to cover for chlamydia. This combination is often used for treating sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - **Ceftriaxone (C)**: This is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is highly effective against gonorrhea. It is often used as a single-dose treatment for gonorrhea. - **Ceftriaxone and vancomycin (D)**: Ceftriaxone is effective against gonorrhea, but adding vancomycin is typically not necessary unless there is a concern for resistant strains or other complications. - **Piperacillin and tazobactam (E)**: This combination is used for more severe infections, such as those caused by gram-negative bacteria, but it is not the first-line treatment for the likely diagnosis in this case. Given the symptoms and the likely diagnosis of gonorrhea, the most appropriate treatment would be a combination that effectively covers both the likely bacterial cause and any potential co-infections. </think><answer> The most likely diagnosis is gonorrhea, given the symptoms and the patient\u2019s sexual activity.

Gonococcal infection is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and can present with these symptoms. The most likely diagnosis is gonococcal arthritis and dermatitis. The treatment for gonococcal infection is usually ceftriaxone, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Let\u2019s consider the treatment options: A: Azithromycin - This is an antibiotic used for chlamydia and other infections, but not for gonorrhea. B: Cefixime and azithromycin - Cefixime is an oral cephalosporin, but it is not as effective as ceftriaxone for gonorrhea. C: Ceftriaxone - This is the standard treatment for gonorrhea. D: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin - Vancomycin is used for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive infections, but it is not necessary for gonorrhea.

The patient presents with pustular skin lesions and a painful, warm knee, which are consistent with gonococcal arthritis or skin infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. However, the presence of pustular lesions is more indicative of a bacterial skin infection, likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Given the patient\u2019s history of cocaine use and occasional sexual activity, we need to consider the possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, the pustular lesions are more suggestive of a skin infection rather than a STI. The most likely diagnosis is a skin infection caused by MRSA, which is common in individuals with risk factors for skin infections, such as cocaine use and smoking. The treatment for MRSA skin infections typically includes antibiotics effective against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The most appropriate antibiotic for MRSA is usually a beta-lactam antibiotic with beta-lactamase inhibition, such as cloxacillin, or a glycopeptide like vancomycin. However, for outpatient treatment, oral antibiotics like clindamycin or doxycycline are often used. Given the options, the most appropriate treatment for a likely MRSA skin infection is: A: Azithromycin - This is typically used for chlamydia and mycoplasma infections, not for MRSA. B: Cefixime and azithromycin - Cefixime is not effective against MRSA, and azithromycin is not the first-line treatment for MRSA. C: Ceftriaxone - This is typically used for gonorrhea and chlamydia, not for MRSA. D: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin - Ceftriaxone is not effective against MRSA, and vancomycin is used for severe cases or when MRSA is suspected.

E: Piperacillin and tazobactam - This is typically used for Gram-negative infections and is not the first-line treatment for MRSA. The most appropriate treatment for a likely MRSA skin infection is a beta-lactam antibiotic with beta-lactamase inhibition, such as dicloxacillin or a glycopeptide like vancomycin. However, among the options provided, the most appropriate treatment would be a combination of an antibiotic effective against MRSA and a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover other potential infections.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for the most likely diagnosis is D: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin.</think><answer>D</answer> CLARity <think>To determine the most appropriate treatment, we first need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and physical exam findings. The patient presents with fever, joint pain, and pustular skin lesions. These symptoms are characteristic of gonococcal arthritis, which is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal arthritis typically affects large joints and is associated with other signs of gonococcal infection such as skin lesions. The most common approach to treating gonococcal arthritis is to treat the underlying gonorrhea infection. The standard treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea includes a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone. Given that the patient also has skin lesions, which could indicate disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), a more aggressive treatment regimen is recommended. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ceftriaxone 250 mg IM plus either azithromycin 1 g orally or cefixime 400 mg orally for the treatment of DGI. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient would be ceftriaxone and either azithromycin or cefixime. Let\u2019s evaluate each option: A: Azithromycin - This is a suitable oral antibiotic for co-treatment with ceftriaxone in DGI. B: Cefixime and azithromycin - This is the recommended combination according to CDC guidelines. C: Ceftriaxone - This is part of the treatment but needs to be combined with an oral antibiotic. D: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin - Vancomycin is not typically used for gonorrhea unless there is evidence of penicillin allergy or resistance. E: Piperacillin and tazobactam - This combination is used for more severe infections like endocarditis but is not the standard treatment for gonococcal arthritis. Given the guidelines, the most appropriate treatment is Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM plus Azithromycin 1 g orally. Therefore, the correct answer is B.</think><answer>B</answer> Table 17: A model response example from different methods in MedQA validation set.

This can be attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one represent- ing the explicit semantics and the other rep- resenting the implicit semantics. These em- beddings coexist in the shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for spe- cific purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental results demon- strate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.1 1 Introduction Sentence embeddings have been extensively stud- ied in the field of natural language processing (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Jiang et al., 2022; LI et al., 2025). However, most existing sen- tence embedding methods struggle to capture im- plicit semantics.2 Sun et al. (2025) pointed out even state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods (Wang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024, 2025) ex- hibit a nearly 20% performance gap between ex- plicit and implicit semantics on the MTEB classifi- cation benchmark (Muennighoff et al., 2023). This may be due to the limitation of existing methods, which assign only a single vector to a sentence and overlook the presence of multiple interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose DualCSE, a dual-semantic contrastive sentence embedding 1Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ iehok/DualCSE. 2In this paper, the term \u201cexplicit semantics\u201d is employed to denote literal meanings, while \u201cimplicit semantics\u201d is used to indicate non-literal meanings derived from figurative or pragmatic usage. Figure 1: Overview of DualCSE. The explicit and im- plicit semantic spaces are combined into a shared space. framework that assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one representing its explicit semantic and the other representing its implicit semantic. As shown in Figure 1, the explicit and implicit se- mantics of sentences are represented in the shared space by DualCSE. For example, the explicit se- mantic of \u201cShe conquered his heart.\u201d(s2) is close to the explicit semantic of \u201cShe defeated his heart in battle.\u201d(s3), and the implicit semantic of s2 is close to the explicit semantic of \u201cShe won his af- fection and love.\u201d(s1). Furthermore, for each of s1 and s3, the similarity between the explicit and implicit semantics is higher than the that of s2. Our method not only provides useful features for fundamental tasks such as information retrieval (Thakur et al., 2021) and text classification (Maas et al., 2011), but also facilitates the estimation of the implicit nature of a given sentence (Wang et al., 2025). DualCSE is trained via contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020) using natural language inference (NLI) datasets based on representative supervised sentence-embedding methods (Gao et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2022; Li and Li,", "but also facilitates the estimation of the implicit nature of a given sentence (Wang et al., 2025). DualCSE is trained via contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020) using natural language inference (NLI) datasets based on representative supervised sentence-embedding methods (Gao et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2022; Li and Li, 2024). Specifically, we leverage an NLI dataset considering both explicit and implicit semantics (Havaldar et al., 2025) as training data and utilize a novel contrastive loss. To evaluate the capability of DualCSE in captur- ing inter-sentence and intra-sentence relations, we conduct two experiments of two tasks: Recogniz- ing Textual Entailment (RTE) and Estimating Im- plicitness Score (EIS). Experimental results show that DualCSE captures inter- and intra-sentence re- arXiv:2510.09293v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Premise Diane says, \u201cWould you like to go a party tonight?\u201d Sophie responds, \u201cI am too tired.\u201d Implied Entailment Sophie would prefer not to attend the party this evening. Explicit Entailment Sophie claims to be too tired. Neutral The party will take place outside. Contradiction Sophie is excited to attend the party this evening. Table 1: An example of a sample in the INLI dataset lations more accurately than conventional methods. 2 Implied NLI (INLI) Dataset The INLI dataset (Havaldar et al., 2025) is used for DualCSE. As shown in Table 1, the INLI dataset differs from standard NLI datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) in that it provides four different hypothe- ses, labeled with \u201cimplied-entailment\u201d, \u201cexplicit- entailment\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d, and \u201ccontradiction\u201d for a single premise. The implied-entailment and explicit-entailment indicate entailment with respect to the implicit and explicit semantics of the premise, respectively.3 3 DualCSE This section presents DualCSE, a method that en- codes each sentence s into two embeddings: r, rep- resenting its explicit semantics and u, representing its implicit semantics. The loss function for learn- ing these embeddings is first explained, followed by a description of the model architecture. 3.1 Contrastive Loss For a given sample in the INLI dataset, let si be a premise, and s+ i1, s+ i2, and s\u2212 i be the explicit- entailment, implied-entailment, and contradiction hypothesis for si, respectively. The explicit- semantic embeddings are denoted as ri, r+ i1, r+ i2, and r\u2212 i , while the implicit-semantic embeddings are denoted as ui, u+ i1, u+ i2, and u\u2212 i . The con- trastive loss li for i-th instance in a batch of size N is calculated as follows: v(h1, h2) = esim(h1,h2)/\u03c4, (1) 3The detailed statistics of the INLI dataset are shown in the Appendix A. Figure 2: Conceptual diagram of contrastive loss in SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021) and our DualCSE. li = \u2212log v(ri, r+ i1) PN j=1(v(ri, r+ j1) + v(ri, r\u2212 j ) + v(ri, uj)) \u2212log v(ui, r+ i2) PN j=1(v(ui, r+ j2) + v(ui, r\u2212 j ) + v(ui, rj)) \u2212log v(r+ i1, u+ i1) PN j=1 v(r+ i1, u+ j1) \u2212log v(r+ i2, u+ i2) PN j=1 v(r+ i2, u+ j2) \u2212log v(r\u2212 i , u\u2212 i ) PN j=1 v(r\u2212 i , u\u2212 j ) ,", "PN j=1(v(ui, r+ j2) + v(ui, r\u2212 j ) + v(ui, rj)) \u2212log v(r+ i1, u+ i1) PN j=1 v(r+ i1, u+ j1) \u2212log v(r+ i2, u+ i2) PN j=1 v(r+ i2, u+ j2) \u2212log v(r\u2212 i , u\u2212 i ) PN j=1 v(r\u2212 i , u\u2212 j ) , (2) where sim(h1, h2) denotes the cosine similarity between h1 and h2, and \u03c4 is the temperature pa- rameter. Intuitively, as shown in Figure 2, the pairs (ri, r+ i1) and (ui, r+ i2) are encouraged to close to- gether, whereas the pairs (ri, r\u2212 i ) and (ui, r\u2212 i ) are encouraged to push apart.4 These are designed to capture inter-sentence relations, i.e., a premise and entailment hypothesis are similar, while a premise and contradiction hypothesis are dissimilar. Fur- thermore, the pairs (r+ i1, u+ i1), (r+ i2, u+ i2), and (r\u2212 i , u\u2212 i ) are encouraged to close together,5 whereas the pair (ri, ui) is encouraged to push apart.6 These are designed to capture intra-sentence relations un- der the assumption that the hypotheses in the INLI dataset are less ambiguous and convey more similar explicit and implicit semantics than a premise. 3.2 Model Architecture This study employs two types of encoder models as follows. 4This is encoded in the first and second terms on the right- hand side of Equation (2). 5This is encoded in the third, fourth, and fifth terms in Equation (2). 6This is encoded in v(ri, uj) in the denominator of the first term and v(ui, rj) in the second term in Equation (2). Cross-encoder A single BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) model that out- puts the representation r for the explicit semantic of s when given the input \u201c[CLS] s [SEP] explicit,\u201d and u for the implicit semantic of s when given the input \u201c[CLS] s [SEP] implicit.\u201d Bi-encoder Two separate BERT or RoBERTa models are trained to obtain r and u, respectively. For both models, the hidden state of the final layer of [CLS] is used as the sentence embedding. 4 Experiments We validate the effectiveness of DualCSE through experiments on two tasks. The first task is Recog- nizing Textual Entailment (RTE), which involves the model\u2019s capacity to correctly capture entailment relationships between sentences. The second task is Estimating Implicitness Score (EIS), which aims to estimate the extent to which an implicit meaning deviates from a literal meaning. 4.1 Experimental Setup For the two model architectures of DualCSE, the pre-trained BERTbase and RoBERTabase are em- ployed as the encoder models. Only the settings and results of the RoBERTa model are reported in this section, since it demonstrated higher perfor- mance than BERT on the development set. The batch size and learning rate are optimized using the development set, resulting in 64 and 5e-5 for the cross-encoder, and 32 and 3e-5 for the bi-encoder.7 The temperature parameter \u03c4 is set to 0.05, follow- ing Gao et al. (2021) and Yoda et al. (2024). 4.2 Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Task definition RTE is a task that classifies a", "development set, resulting in 64 and 5e-5 for the cross-encoder, and 32 and 3e-5 for the bi-encoder.7 The temperature parameter \u03c4 is set to 0.05, follow- ing Gao et al. (2021) and Yoda et al. (2024). 4.2 Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Task definition RTE is a task that classifies a given premise and hypothesis pair (p, h) as either \u201centailment\u201d or \u201cnon-entailment.\u201d The INLI dataset (Havaldar et al., 2025) is used for the experiment, where the neutral and contradiction labels are con- verted to \u201cnon-entailment,\u201d and both explicit and implied entailment are retained as \u201centailment.\u201d Method Let r1 and r2 be the representations of the explicit semantics of the premise p and hypoth- esis h, respectively, and u1 be the representation of the implicit semantics of p. DualCSE predicts that p and h are in an entailment relation if max \u0000cos(r1, r2), cos(u1, r2) \u0001 > \u03b3, (3) 7The optimization results are shown in Appendix B. Model Exp. Imp. Neu. Con.

The thresh- old \u03b3 is tuned on the INLI development set. Baselines Two baselines are compared to Du- alCSE: SimCSE (SNLI+MNLI) (Gao et al., 2021) and SimCSE (INLI). The latter is a SimCSE model trained on the INLI dataset. These baselines predict labels using the same approach as our model, which involves determining whether the cosine similarity between the premise and hypothesis embeddings exceeds the threshold. Additionally, for reference, we also provide the results of a few-shot setting with large language models (LLMs).8 Results The results are shown in Table 2. First, the proposed method DualCSE outperforms Sim- CSE (INLI) in both model architectures, demon- strating the effectiveness of representations for the explicit and implicit semantics of sentences. Next, SimCSE (SNLI+MNLI) has the largest gap in ac- curacy between Exp. and Imp. This is likely due to SNLI and MNLI containing relatively few sentences with implicit semantics, as reported by Havaldar et al. (2025). Finally, LLMs generally demonstrate superior performance compared to the encoder models. However, similar to other models, LLMs consistently show a tendency toward lower performance on Imp. compared to Exp.9 4.3 Estimating Implicitness Score (EIS) Task definition Given two sentences s1 and s2, predict which sentence exhibits a higher degree of implicitness. Two datasets are employed for this task: the INLI (Havaldar et al., 2025) and the dataset provided by Wang et al. (2025). For the INLI, it is supposed that the premise is more im- plicit than the hypothesis. 8Detailed prompts are provided in Appendix C. 9The results of other LLMs are provided in Appendix D. Query: Madeleine has just moved into a neighbourhood and meets her new neighbour Pierre. Pierre says, \u201cAre you from this state?\u201d", "is supposed that the premise is more im- plicit than the hypothesis. 8Detailed prompts are provided in Appendix C. 9The results of other LLMs are provided in Appendix D. Query: Madeleine has just moved into a neighbourhood and meets her new neighbour Pierre. Pierre says, \u201cAre you from this state?\u201d Madeleine responds, \u201cI\u2019m from Oregon.\u201d Explicit semantic: Madeleine is from Oregon. Implicit semantic: Madeleine was born in a different state. #1 Laverne moved from Canada. #1 The place does not belong to Quincy. #2 Angela and her family live in Portland now. #2 Madeleine enjoys food with some spice, but not if it\u2019s overly hot. #3 Alyce works in Portland. #3 Earlene is not originally from this area. Table 3: An example of a simple retrieval experiment. Explicit semantic and Implicit semantic are the explicit- entailment and implied-entailment hypotheses in the INLI dataset, respectively. These are not used as a query for sentence retrieval. Model INLI Wang et al.

(4) We predict which of the sentences s1 and s2 has the greater implicitness score: arg max \u0000imp(s1), imp(s2) \u0001 . (5) Baselines Three baselines are compared in this experiment: (1) LENGTH, which chooses the longer sentence, (2) ImpScore (original) (Wang et al., 2025), and (3) ImpScore (INLI), which is the ImpScore trained on the INLI dataset using RoBERTa as the encoder model. Results The results are shown in Table 4. First, DualCSE achieves near-perfect accuracy in both model architectures for the INLI dataset, i.e., for the in-domain setting. However, this may be be- cause the length ratio of the input sentence pairs serves as a useful signal, as evidenced by the near-perfect performance accuracy achieved by LENGTH as well. Next, in the out-of-domain set- ting (Wang\u2019s dataset), the accuracy of DualCSE and ImpScore (INLI) decreases to nearly 80%. The performance of DualCSE is comparable to that of ImpScore. It is worth noting that the ImpScore has been developed specifically for the purpose of predicting the implicitness score, whereas our DualCSE is capable of generating embeddings for both explicit and implicit semantics, which enables it to perform other downstream tasks.10 10The results of other models are provided in Appendix E.

We train the mod- els in three scenarios: excluding the loss for con- tradiction hypotheses, excluding the loss for intra- sentence relations, and excluding both. As shown in Table 5, the loss for contradiction hypotheses is more effective for the RTE task, while the loss for intra-sentence relations is more effective for the EIS task.11 Retrieval Experiment A qualitative", "the loss for con- tradiction hypotheses, excluding the loss for intra- sentence relations, and excluding both. As shown in Table 5, the loss for contradiction hypotheses is more effective for the RTE task, while the loss for intra-sentence relations is more effective for the EIS task.11 Retrieval Experiment A qualitative evaluation of the explicit and implicit embeddings is con- ducted through a simple search experiment. Specif- ically, we select several premises from the develop- ment data of INLI as queries and retrieve the top three similar hypotheses from the training data that most closely match the explicit and implicit seman- tics of each query. As shown in Table 3, DualCSE facilitates a separate search for the sentences that correspond to explicit and implicit semantics.12 6 Conclusion This paper proposed DualCSE, a sentence embed- ding method that assigns two representations for the explicit and implicit semantics of sentences. The experimental results of the RTE and EIS tasks demonstrated DualCSE successfully encoded lit- eral and latent meanings into separate embeddings. 11More details of the ablation and the results of other mod- els are described in Appendix F. 12Other examples are described in Appendix G. Limitations We use only the INLI (Havaldar et al., 2025) dataset for the training. However, the variation of the sen- tences in the INLI is rather limited. It is important to apply DualCSE to the training data of various domains. For example, the datasets for hate speech detection (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) and sentiment analysis (Pontiki et al., 2014) are converted to the INLI format and can be used as the training data. This study conducted a simple retrieval exper- iment with the aim of applying it to real-world applications. In the future, it would be desirable to apply our method to more practical settings, such as analyzing customer reviews and implementing search engines. Recently, sentence embedding methods using LLMs have been actively studied (BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Yamada and Zhang, 2025). Extending our method to LLMs is another future direction. References Parishad BehnamGhader, Vaibhav Adlakha, Marius Mosbach, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Nicolas Chapados, and Siva Reddy. 2024.

This rapid progress is driven by a tightly coupled cycle of development and evaluation, where benchmarks and public leaderboards serve as essential feedback mechanisms (Cao et al., 2025). They enable researchers to measure model capabilities, compare methodologies, and guide future research. Consequently, considerable effort has focused on designing benchmarks to evaluate what capabilities a model possesses (Ni et al., 2025). However, the reliability of these evaluations is challenged by the inherent volatility of pre-training, where drastic parameter updates and fragile instruction-following abilities introduce significant noise. As illustrated in Figure 1, this evaluation instability critically impacts the entire LLM pre- training lifecycle: (1) In ablations studies, it leads to ambiguous comparisons and can even yield incorrect", "evaluations is challenged by the inherent volatility of pre-training, where drastic parameter updates and fragile instruction-following abilities introduce significant noise. As illustrated in Figure 1, this evaluation instability critically impacts the entire LLM pre- training lifecycle: (1) In ablations studies, it leads to ambiguous comparisons and can even yield incorrect conclusions (Figure 1a). (2) During the pre-training process, it causes volatile performance trajectories that obscure underlying data or training issues (Figure 1b). (3) After pre-training, it results in a poor correlation between the observed base model\u2019s performance and its downstream counterparts, meaning improvements do not reliably transfer to post-training tasks (Figure 1c). These phenomena obscure genuine training progress and invalidate ablation studies, ultimately undermining the validity of our scientific conclusions. This raises a critical question: how to reliably measure learning dynamics during LLM pre-training? To address this issue, we systematically diagnose evaluation instability, tracing it to two primary and compounding sources: (1) Parameter Instability: This variance arises from the stochastic nature of the training trajectory. An LLM\u2019s path through the high-dimensional parameter space is inherently non-smooth, meaning any single checkpoint may represent a transiently suboptimal state or a sharp local minimum (Jastrz\u02dbebski et al., 2017; Hansen, 1992; Fort et al., 2020). Thus, performance can fluctuate dramatically, rendering evaluations at any single checkpoint an unreliable and noisy snapshot of the model\u2019s true capability (Achille et al., 2017). (2) Evaluation Instability: This variance is introduced by the fragility of measurement protocols. For generative tasks such as code generation or mathematical reasoning, metrics based on a single output (e.g., greedy decoding) resemble high-variance Bernoulli trials. The results are highly sensitive to sampling \u201cluck\u201d, where a small number of favorable or unfavorable generations can disproportionately affect evaluation outcomes (Song et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2025; Mirzadeh et al., 2024). Based on this diagnosis, we propose MaP, a dual-pronged framework that leverages checkpoint Merging and the Pass@k metric to handle both sources of noise. First, to mitigate parameter instability, we employ Checkpoint Merging (Izmailov et al., 2018; Wortsman et al., 2022). By averaging the weights of recent checkpoints, this technique smooths the training trajectory in parameter space, yielding a more stable estimate of the model\u2019s central tendency. Second, to address evaluation instability, we adopt the Pass@k metric (Chen et al., 2021). This replaces high-variance, single-output measurements with a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of the model\u2019s success probability, hardening the evaluation against sampling randomness. While these two techniques have been explored in prior work, they have largely been used in isolation and for distinct purposes. Specifically, checkpoint merging has primarily been applied to enhance final model performance (Aakanksha et al., 2025; Ram\u00e9 et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Tian et al., 2025), whereas Pass@k serves as a standard for code evaluation or for probing a model\u2019s latent potential (Chen et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2025). In contrast, we are the first to 2 synergistically integrate these methods into a unified framework, specifically designed to stabilize pre-training evaluation and offer a more reliable lens through which to observe training dynamics. Our extensive", "latent potential (Chen et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2025). In contrast, we are the first to 2 synergistically integrate these methods into a unified framework, specifically designed to stabilize pre-training evaluation and offer a more reliable lens through which to observe training dynamics. Our extensive experiments across a diverse suite of benchmarks demonstrate that MaP yields smoother performance trajectories, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. Crucially, this heightened stability provides a significantly clearer and more faithful signal of model progress during the pre-training phase. In summary, our core contributions are as follows: (1) We identify and systematically diagnose the long-standing yet under-recognized problem of evaluation instability in pre-training, decoupling it into the distinct sources of parameter instability and evaluation instability. (2) We introduce MaP, a simple yet effective framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint merging and Pass@k address both sources of instability, thereby establishing a robust and stable evaluation pipeline for pre-training. (3) Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that MaP enables a more reliable obser- vation of training dynamics, effectively mitigating misleading artifacts and laying an empirical foundation for the LLM research community. 2 Method 2.1 Conceptual Framework To formalize the instability observed in Figure 1, we decompose the overall stability of LLM performance into two orthogonal factors: parameter stability and evaluation stability. Conceptually, this relationship can be approximated as: Overall Stability \u2248Parameter Stability \u00d7 Evaluation Stability. Our framework aims to maximize overall stability by independently optimizing both components. Parameter Stability reflects the extent to which a checkpoint\u2019s performance at a given training stage is representative of its true capability, rather than an artifact of transient parameter configu- rations. Due to optimization stochasticity, individual checkpoints may occupy noisy or atypical regions of the loss landscape, leading to erratic performance fluctuations. When parameter in- stability is high, checkpoint-based evaluations become unreliable indicators of learning progress, masking the model\u2019s underlying trajectory. Evaluation Stability refers to the consistency of performance scores produced by the evaluation protocol for a fixed set of model parameters. Instability in this component is primarily driven by measurement noise \u2014 for instance, randomness in generative sampling. 2.2 Mitigating Parameter Instability via Checkpoint Merging The training trajectory of an LLM is a noisy path through a high-dimensional parameter space. A single checkpoint may represent a transiently suboptimal state or a sharp local minimum, rather than the model\u2019s robust, generalized capability (Hansen, 1992). However, previous work predominantly relies on evaluating a single checkpoint, which makes the reported performance highly sensitive to these random fluctuations and yields an unreliable measure of the model\u2019s true 3 potential. While weight averaging is known to construct versatile models (Aakanksha et al., 2025; Ram\u00e9 et al., 2024) or improve generalization (Sanyal et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Kaddour, 2022; Li et al., 2023), we repurpose it as a dynamic stabilization tool to denoise model parameters at each evaluation step. We average the parameters of the most recent N checkpoints from the training run (Tian et al., 2025). This procedure smooths out high-frequency fluctuations in the parameter space, effectively finding a", "et al., 2023), we repurpose it as a dynamic stabilization tool to denoise model parameters at each evaluation step. We average the parameters of the most recent N checkpoints from the training run (Tian et al., 2025). This procedure smooths out high-frequency fluctuations in the parameter space, effectively finding a more stable central point in the recent training trajectory. This merged model is hypothesized to reside in a broader, flatter region of the loss landscape, leading to more robust and representative performance. Let \u03b8t be the parameter vector of the model at training step t. Given the current training step T and a merging window of size N, we select the set of the recent N checkpoints {\u03b8T\u2212N+1, . . . , \u03b8T\u22121, \u03b8T}. The parameters of the merged model, \u02c6\u03b8T, are computed as their element-wise average: \u02c6\u03b8T = 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b8T\u2212i A Statistical View of Parameter Stabilization Let \u03b8\u2217 t denote the ideal parameter vector that captures the central tendency of the training process at step t. A checkpoint saved at step t can be modeled as this ideal vector corrupted by zero-mean noise, \u03f5t, arising from stochastic factors such as data batching and dropout: \u03b8t = \u03b8\u2217 t + \u03f5t, where E[\u03f5t] = 0. The performance of a single checkpoint \u03b8t is thus a noisy representation of the performance of \u03b8\u2217 t . If we assume the noise vectors from recent, nearby checkpoints {\u03f5T\u2212N+1, . . . , \u03f5T} are approximately independent, we can analyze the effect of averaging. The merged model \u02c6\u03b8T is: \u02c6\u03b8T = 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b8T\u2212i = 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 (\u03b8\u2217 T\u2212i + \u03f5T\u2212i) = 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b8\u2217 T\u2212i + 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03f5T\u2212i 1 N \u2211N\u22121 i=0 \u03b8\u2217 T\u2212i approximates the ideal model obtained by applying learning rate annealing along the ideal training trajectory (Tian et al., 2025). If Var(\u03f5t) = \u03a3, then the variance of the averaged noise is: Var 1 N N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03f5T\u2212i ! = 1 N2 N\u22121 \u2211 i=0 Var(\u03f5T\u2212i) = \u03a3 N Thus, checkpoint merging reduces the variance of the parameter noise by a factor of N. The resulting model \u02c6\u03b8T is a statistically more stable estimate of the ideal model \u03b8\u2217 T, providing a significantly more reliable basis for evaluation. 2.3 Mitigating Evaluation Instability via Pass@k For generative tasks like code and math, metrics such as accuracy on a single greedy-decoded sample are equivalent to a high-variance Bernoulli trial for each problem. The final score is thus highly susceptible to sampling luck. While the Pass@k protocol (Chen et al., 2021) has typically been employed in specific domains like code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2024) or probe the upper bounds of a model\u2019s capability (Yue et al., 2025), we reposition it here through the lens of evaluation stability and consistency. Our framework elevates Pass@k from a task-specific metric to a general principle for robust generative evaluation. By generating multiple candidate solutions, it 4 moves beyond a simple average over n samples (which is", "capability (Yue et al., 2025), we reposition it here through the lens of evaluation stability and consistency. Our framework elevates Pass@k from a task-specific metric to a general principle for robust generative evaluation. By generating multiple candidate solutions, it 4 moves beyond a simple average over n samples (which is an estimator for Pass@1). Instead, by measuring the probability of generating at least one correct answer in k attempts (where k > 1), it employs a less stringent success criterion. This approach has a distinct advantage when assessing downstream consistency, as it better reflects a model\u2019s latent potential rather than its performance on a single, high-variance greedy decode. As we will demonstrate in Section 3.4, this makes the resulting evaluation not only more robust by reducing score variance but also a more reliable predictor. A Probabilistic View of Measurement Stabilization For a given problem, let p denote the model\u2019s latent probability of generating a correct solution in a single attempt. A standard evaluation observes a single outcome, s \u223cBernoulli(p). The variance of this single-trial measurement is high: Var(s) = p(1 \u2212p) For challenging problems where p is not close to 0 or 1, this variance is substantial, making the observed outcome highly sensitive to sampling luck. Instead of this noisy single-point measurement, the Pass@k protocol leverages n independent samples to provide a stable, unbiased estimate of the model\u2019s capability. As we formally derive in Appendix D, the variance of the Pass@k estimator, \u02c6qk, can be shown to be approximately: Var( \u02c6qk) \u2248k2(1 \u2212p)2(k\u22121) \u00b7 p(1 \u2212p) n This result demonstrates a substantial reduction in measurement variance. By replacing a high- variance single data point with a low-variance statistical estimate, the final score becomes more stable and consistently reflects the model\u2019s true capability. 2.4 The Complete Synergistic Framework Our full stabilization framework is the synergistic application of both techniques. At each eval- uation point, we first apply Checkpoint Merge to obtain a low-variance model estimate \u02c6\u03b8T. We then evaluate this stable model using the low-variance Pass@k protocol. By jointly mitigating both noises, we achieve a maximally stable and reliable assessment of model progress. Key Takeaway Our full stabilization framework jointly mitigating both source noise and measurement noise: \u2022 Checkpoint Merging improves parameter stability by averaging the weights of the last N checkpoints, reducing the parameter noise variance by a factor of N. \u2022 Pass@k improves evaluation stability by aggregating results from n output samples, reducing measurement variance by a factor of n/[k2(1 \u2212p)2(k\u22121)]. 3 Experiment 3.1 Experimental Setup Metrics for quantifying stability To move beyond qualitative observations and quantitatively assess the stability of our evaluation framework, we introduce two specialized metrics. First, to quantify the stability of the learning trajectory, we measure how consistently performance improves over time. The core intuition is that a stable training process should ensure that a later 5 checkpoint\u2019s performance is consistently non-decreasing relative to an earlier one. To formalize this, we compute Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (\u03c4) (Kendall, 1938) between the chronological sequence of checkpoints and their evaluation scores (Luan et al., 2025). A higher \u03c4 indicates", "a stable training process should ensure that a later 5 checkpoint\u2019s performance is consistently non-decreasing relative to an earlier one. To formalize this, we compute Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (\u03c4) (Kendall, 1938) between the chronological sequence of checkpoints and their evaluation scores (Luan et al., 2025). A higher \u03c4 indicates a more stable and predictable learning trajectory. It is defined as: \u03c4 = P \u2212(n(n \u22121)/2 \u2212P) n(n \u22121)/2 = 4P n(n \u22121) \u22121 where n is the number of checkpoints, and P is the number of concordant pairs, that is, pairs in which a later checkpoint achieves a higher score than an earlier one. A \u03c4 value of 1 indicates perfect monotonic improvement, while a value near 0 suggests performance fluctuates randomly over time. Second, to evaluate how well pre-training performance predicts downstream capabilities, we introduce the Pairwise Ranking Reversal Rate (PRR). This metric quantifies the proportion of model pairs whose relative ranking reverses after a subsequent stage such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). For a set of M models, the PRR is: PRR = 1 (M 2 ) \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264M I h (RPT(i) \u2212RPT(j)) \u00b7 (RSFT(i) \u2212RSFT(j)) < 0 i where RPT(i) and RSFT(i) are the performance ranks of model i before and after fine-tuning, respectively, and I[\u00b7] is the indicator function. A PRR of 0 indicates perfect rank consistency, while a PRR of 0.5 implies that pre-training evaluation provides no predictive signal for downstream rankings. Models and benchmarks To enable fine-grained analysis of the training trajectory, we conduct experiments using intermediate checkpoints from our own pre-trained models. Our primary model is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 16.3B total parameters and 1.4B active parameters. Comprehensive details regarding our model architecture and specific training parameters are provided in Appendix A. We evaluate performance across various benchmark categories: General (AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2024), RACE (Lai et al., 2017), SQuAD2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018)); Knowledge (e.g., MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), CMMLU (Li et al., 2024a), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023)); Math (e.g., GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024b), CMATH (Wei et al., 2023)); and Code (e.g., HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Tao et al., 2024), HumanEval-Plus (Liu et al., 2023), MBPP-Plus (Liu et al., 2023)). To manage the computational cost associated with the Pass@k metric, we report its results on a representative subset of key generative tasks: GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, and MBPP. All experiments are implemented using the OpenCompass frame- work (Contributors, 2023). 3.2 The Synergistic Effect of the Unified Framework While Checkpoint Merging and Pass@k individually mitigate instability, they target distinct sources of variance. Stabilizing only the model parameters via merging still leaves the evaluation suscepti- ble to measurement noise. Conversely, a robust evaluation protocol like Pass@k cannot compensate for the inherent volatility of the underlying model checkpoints. We therefore hypothesize that their combined application is necessary to achieve maximal stability. To validate this, we conduct an ablation study during a long-term, 10T-token pre-training run.

The results are presented both qualitatively in Figure 2 and quantitatively in Table 1. Both individ- ual methods show substantial improvement over the baseline protocol, and the full framework achieves the highest or near-highest correlation scores, demonstrating a clear synergistic effect. These findings show that jointly addressing parameter and evaluation instability is crucial for achieving truly reliable LLM evaluation.

Smoothing Single-Run Trajectories. For tracking performance throughout a single training run, Figure 3 visualizes the model\u2019s performance trajectory across various benchmarks over 500B tokens. We observe that evaluation scores of individual checkpoints exhibit significant volatility, at times resembling random fluctuations. In contrast, the merged model (checkpoints saved every 25B tokens, with the latest 4 averaged) demonstrates a visibly smoother trend. Table 2 provides quantitative validation, reporting Kendall\u2019s rank correlation (\u03c4) between evaluation scores and pre- training steps. Our merging approach achieves higher correlation on the majority of benchmarks, indicating a more stable measure of learning progress. Reducing Inter-Run Variance. For ablation studies across multiple training runs, Figure 4 illus- trates the performance of models trained on three distinct corpora (Math, Code, and Knowledge) on corresponding benchmarks, comparing individual checkpoints with their merged counterparts. The performance scores of original checkpoints fluctuate dramatically \u2014 exhibiting sharp drops and surges even in later training stages (e.g., for Math and Code), with trajectories frequently crossing. Judging solely from these volatile curves, it is difficult to determine which training strategy is truly optimal for a given capability. In contrast, the merged models (checkpoints saved every 12.5B tokens, with the latest 4 averaged) eliminate this volatility.

A key hyperparameter for merging is the number of checkpoints (N) included in the average. Intuitively, a larger N should increase stability by mitigating the impact of any single outlier checkpoint, effectively smoothing the parameter space. We empirically study this relationship by varying the merge window size. As shown in Table 3, when the checkpoint saving interval is fixed at 12.5B tokens, merging as few as 4 to 8 checkpoints yields substantial improvements in evaluation stability across most benchmarks.

We first analyze the effect of Pass@k on stabilizing evaluation during training. Table 4 reports Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (\u03c4) for a series of 54 checkpoints trained on 1.5T tokens, evaluated across different benchmarks. For generative benchmarks (Math and Code), as k in Pass@k increases, the Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 value consistently rises. This indicates that Pass@k provides a more monotonic and stable signal of training progress compared to the high volatility of greedy decoding. Conversely, we observe a sharp decline in consistency for multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks (Knowledge). We hypothesize this is due to their limited answer space, where repeated sampling may lead to correct answers being guessed by chance, thereby introducing", "stable signal of training progress compared to the high volatility of greedy decoding. Conversely, we observe a sharp decline in consistency for multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks (Knowledge). We hypothesize this is due to their limited answer space, where repeated sampling may lead to correct answers being guessed by chance, thereby introducing noise rather than measuring robust capability. This finding suggests that Pass@k is ill-suited for MC-style evaluations; we apply it exclusively to generative tasks subsequently.

We generate n = 4 samples per problem and calculate the metric for k = {1, 2, 4}. 9 Enhancing Prediction of Downstream Performance. Next, we investigate whether this improved stability translates into better prediction of downstream performance. Figure 5 presents an experi- ment in which we train 12 smaller models (243M active parameters) using varied training strategies (e.g., learning rate schedulers) and then apply an identical SFT process to each. Figure 5 (Left) plots pre-training ranks against post-SFT ranks using greedy evaluation. The Pairwise Ranking Reversal Rate (PRR) reaches 50%, indicating that selecting a model for the next stage of the pipeline based on this evaluation is no better than random chance. In contrast, when using Pass@16 for evaluation (Figure 5 (Middle)), the PRR drops significantly to 22.73%. This trend is systematic, as shown in Figure 5 (Right): the reversal proportion decreases monotonically as k increases, confirming that a more stable evaluation protocol yields a more reliable forecast of downstream ranking. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Rank After Fine-tuning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Rank Before FT (Greedy Score) Consistent Good Consistent Poor (a) Reversal Proportion=50% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Rank After Fine-tuning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Rank Before FT (Pass@16) Consistent Good Consistent Poor (b) Reversal Proportion=22.73% 0 1 2 4 8 16 k 10 20 30 40 50 60 Reversal Proportion (c) cost greedy pass@k 2.0x 4.0x 6.0x 8.0x 10.0x 12.0x Figure 5 Pass@k improves the consistency between pre-training and post-SFT model rankings.

(c) The reversal proportion decreases monotonically as the sample count k increases. The Impact of k: The Trade-off with Sample Budget.

The Impact of k: The Trade-off with Sample Budget. The choice of k in Pass@k directly governs the trade-off between evaluation stability and computational cost. As demonstrated quantitatively in Table 4 and visualized in Figure 5 (Right), both stability and the reliability of model rankings improve monotonically as k increases. However, this enhanced robustness comes at a significant cost. The line graph in Figure 5 (Right) illustrates this near-linear growth in estimated evaluation cost with k (see Appendix C for details). This establishes a clear need for researchers to balance their desired level of evaluation confidence with their available computational budget. To navigate this trade-off, future work could explore several promising directions. One practical strategy involves evaluating on smaller, carefully curated benchmark subsets that are highly representative of a model\u2019s capabilities. Another avenue is the development of dynamic sampling strategies, such as an early-stopping mechanism that terminates generation for a given problem once a correct solution is found. 4 Related Work 4.1 LLM Evaluation and Benchmarking As models began to saturate these benchmarks, the community\u2019s focus shifted towards more challenging and holistic evaluations designed to probe the broad, multi-task knowledge and reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. Consequently, a new generation of benchmarks has 10 emerged, targeting complex capabilities such as expert-level knowledge (e.g., MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a)), mathematical problem-solving (e.g., MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b)), and code generation (e.g., HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)). While this explosion in benchmark creation has been pivotal in defining what to evaluate, it has often overshadowed the critical procedural question of how to obtain stable, reproducible measurements. Most public leaderboards report single-point estimates, a practice that implicitly disregards the substantial performance variance we identify in this work and can lead to fragile or even misleading conclusions about model superiority. Our contribution complements this line of research not by introducing a new benchmark, but by proposing a more robust methodology for leveraging existing ones, thereby addressing the critical yet frequently overlooked issue of evaluation stability. 4.2 Stability and Robustness of Evaluation The sensitivity of deep learning models, including LLMs, to stochastic factors such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and sampling randomness during inference is a well-documented phenomenon (D\u2019Amour et al., 2022; Bouthillier et al., 2021). This inherent variability can lead to significant performance fluctuations across training or inference runs, even under identical hyperparameter configurations, making it challenging to distinguish genuine improvements from statistical noise. Moreover, Ranjan et al. (2024) introduces a phenomenon where performance trends observed in base machine learning models are inverted after applying post-hoc transforms. Prior work by Bouthillier et al. (2021); Philipp et al. (2018) has quantified this variability through repeated experimental trials. In the context of LLMs, Luan et al. (2025) improved evaluation stability by reformulating prompts and converting option-perplexity scoring into a fill-in-the-blank format. In contrast to these approaches, our work provides a more systematic diagnosis of evaluation instability by identifying its two primary sources and offering a synergistic solution for each. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we identify the critical", "evaluation stability by reformulating prompts and converting option-perplexity scoring into a fill-in-the-blank format. In contrast to these approaches, our work provides a more systematic diagnosis of evaluation instability by identifying its two primary sources and offering a synergistic solution for each. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we identify the critical problem of instability in Large Language Model evaluation. We decouple the issue into two primary sources: parameter instability from the stochasticity of training, and evaluation instability from fragile measurement protocols. To mitigate these, we propose a simple and effective dual-pronged framework combining Checkpoint Merging and the Pass@k metric. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly smooths performance trajectories, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. By providing a more reliable and reproducible evaluation paradigm, our work establishes a more solid foundation for the future development of large language models. As future works, we plan to focus on enhancing the computational efficiency of this framework (e.g., adaptive sampling techniques), and a deeper investigation into the underlying causes of training volatility across different model scales and architectures will be crucial for developing inherently more stable training paradigms.

A Experimental Settings Model architecture The core architectures of our experimental model are detailed in Table 5. The model is configured with 20 layers and a hidden dimension size of 2048. Except for the first layer, all FFNs layers are replaced with MoE layers. We adopt the GQA attention mechanism (Ainslie et al., 2023) and integrate Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024), enabling the model to support sequence lengths up to 8K tokens. For parameter initialization, all learnable parameters are randomly initialized using a standard deviation of 0.006. Under this configuration, the model consists of a total of 16.3 billion parameters, of which approximately 1.43 billion are activated for each token during inference. Table 5 Detailed model architecture. Parameter Value Number of layers (nlayers) 20 Model dimension (dmodel) 2,048 FFN dimension (d f f n) 5,120 Expert dimension (dexpert) 512 Number of attention heads (nheads) 16 Number of KV heads (nkv_head) 4 Total experts (E) 256 Active experts (Ea) 8 Shared experts (Es) 1 Total parameters (N) 16.3B Active parameters (Na) 1.43B Training hyperparameters We use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) with hyperparameters set as follows: \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.95, and weight decay of 0.1. Gradient clip- ping (Zhang et al., 2020) norm is set to 1.0. According to the scaling laws for MoE optimal hyper-parameters, the maximum learning rates were set to 3.74e\u22124. The batch size is set to 2048, and with a maximum sequence length of 8K, each training batch contains 16M tokens. B Experimental Settings for PRR Analysis To investigate the Pairwise Ranking Reversal Rate (PRR), we conduct a controlled experiment involving the pre-training and subsequent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multiple model variants. For this study, we utilize smaller-scale models that share the same architecture as our primary model but have a total of 243M parameters. The base pre-training is conducted on 152B tokens with a learning rate of 1e\u22123 and a global batch size of 512. To generate a diverse set of models 15 for ranking, we introduced variations in the training strategy; specifically, during the final 10% of the pre-training phase, each model variant was trained using a different learning rate schedule. Following pre-training, each of the resulting checkpoints is subjected to an identical SFT process to ensure a fair comparison. This process involve fine-tuning each model on a dataset of 100k samples for 5 epochs. This setup allowe us to isolate the effect of the pre-training evaluation protocol on predicting post-SFT performance rankings. C Cost Estimation for Pass@k Evaluating generative models with Pass@k, while enhancing robustness, introduces computational overhead. We estimate the relative evaluation cost using the following formula: Cost =", "samples for 5 epochs. This setup allowe us to isolate the effect of the pre-training evaluation protocol on predicting post-SFT performance rankings. C Cost Estimation for Pass@k Evaluating generative models with Pass@k, while enhancing robustness, introduces computational overhead. We estimate the relative evaluation cost using the following formula: Cost = (input_cost_cache_not_hit \u00d7 input_tokens) + (input_cost_cache_hit \u00d7 input_tokens \u00d7 (n \u22121)) + (output_cost \u00d7 output_tokens \u00d7 n) Here, input_cost_cache_not_hit represents the cost for the first prompt generation (cache miss), while input_cost_cache_hit applies to subsequent generations where the prompt can be reused (cache hit). output_cost is the cost per generated token, and n is the total number of samples generated per problem.

We can model this outcome as a Bernoulli trial: X \u223cBernoulli(p) For evaluation, we generate n independent candidate solutions. The outcomes are a set of i.i.d. random variables, X1, . . . , Xn. The total number of successful solutions, S = \u2211n i=1 Xi, follows a Binomial distribution: S \u223cBinomial(n, p). The metric of Pass@k is the probability of obtaining at least one successful solution when drawing k samples. This target parameter, which we denote as qk, is given by: qk = 1 \u2212(1 \u2212p)k. In a practical evaluation setting, we generate n samples and observe a specific realization of the random variable S. From this count of correct solutions, we construct the standard unbiased 16 estimator for Pass@k, denoted bqk,n, which is based on the hypergeometric probability of drawing k failures from the set of n samples, given that n \u2212S of them are failures: bqk,n = 1 \u2212(n\u2212S k ) (n k) , for n \u2265k. While the exact variance of bqk,n has a complex closed-form expression, a highly accurate approxi- mation for sufficiently large n can be derived using the Delta method. This approach analyzes the variance of a simpler, asymptotically equivalent estimator. First, we use the sample mean, \u02c6p = S/n, to estimate the underlying success probability p. Var( \u02c6p) = Var \u0012S n \u0013 = np(1 \u2212p) n2 = p(1 \u2212p) n . The target parameter qk is a function of p, which we define as h(p) = 1 \u2212(1 \u2212p)k. The Delta method provides an approximation for the variance of a function of a random variable, Var(h( \u02c6p)) \u2248 [h\u2032(p)]2 Var( \u02c6p), where h\u2032(p) is the first derivative. In this case, h\u2032(p) = k(1 \u2212p)k\u22121. Substituting these components into the formula yields the approximate variance of the Pass@k estimator: Var(bqk,n) \u2248Var(h( \u02c6p) \u2248[k(1 \u2212p)k\u22121]2 \u00b7 p(1 \u2212p) n = k2(1 \u2212p)2(k\u22121)p(1 \u2212p) n . To appreciate the stability gained, we compare this to the variance of a single-sample Bernoulli", "this case, h\u2032(p) = k(1 \u2212p)k\u22121. Substituting these components into the formula yields the approximate variance of the Pass@k estimator: Var(bqk,n) \u2248Var(h( \u02c6p) \u2248[k(1 \u2212p)k\u22121]2 \u00b7 p(1 \u2212p) n = k2(1 \u2212p)2(k\u22121)p(1 \u2212p) n . To appreciate the stability gained, we compare this to the variance of a single-sample Bernoulli trial, Var(X) = p(1 \u2212p). The ratio of the variances is: Var(bqk,n) Var(X) \u2248k2(1 \u2212p)2(k\u22121) n . In conclusion, the Pass@k metric, by leveraging a multi-sample estimator, replaces a high-variance measurement with a statistically robust estimate whose variance is drastically lower, leading to more reliable and reproducible evaluation results. 17", "ShiZhi: A Chinese Lightweight Large Language Model for Court View Generation Zhitian Hou1, Kun Zeng1,* 1School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China *Corresponding Author Correspondence: houzht@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zengkun2@mail.sysu.edu.cn Abstract Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the \"Court View\" section of a legal case document. Gen- erating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and di- rectly generating from raw facts may limit per- formance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We con- struct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each contain- ing fact descriptions paired with correspond- ing court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view gener- ation and 86.1% accuracy with 92.5% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can gener- ate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our model and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhitianHou/ShiZhi. 1 Introduction In recent years, Legal Artificial Intelligence (Le- gal AI) has gained significant attention due to its potential to assist in judicial decision-making, le- gal document analysis, and other tasks (Hou et al., 2025). Among various tasks in Legal AI, Crimi- nal Court View Generation (CVG) has emerged as an important problem(Ye et al., 2018a). Specifi- cally, in countries with a case law system, such as the United States, legal case documents generally consist of Procedure, Fact, Court View, Decision, and Tail sections. In contrast, the structure of Chi- nese legal case documents is implicitly conveyed through text formatting(Li et al., 2023). Moreover, criminal court views typically comprise rationales and charges, where the charges are derived and explained based on the rationales(Wu et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2018a). The goal of CVG is generat- Web Raw Data Processed Data Qwen2-0.6B- Instruct ShiZhi Collection Pre- Processing Training Figure 1: The pipeline of our data curation and model training. ing \"Court View\" section of legal case documents based on Fact. A number of recent works have explored neu- ral network-based approaches for CVG. Yue et al. (Yue et al., 2021) designed a circumstances- enhanced framework to separately generate adjudi- cating and sentencing reasoning. Yue et al. (Yue et al., 2024) proposed Event Grounded Genera- tion (EGG), which introduces fine-grained event information from case facts into court view gen- eration. EGG first extracts events from case facts using LLM-based methods and incorporates them into the generation by merging facts and events. Despite these efforts, CVG remains a text-to-text generation task, making it a natural fit for large language models (LLMs). However, to date, there is no dedicated LLM specifically trained for court view generation. To fill this gap, we develop ShiZhi, a 0.5B- parameter LLM for CVG. The model size is com- parable to Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) widely used in CVG research. Our contributions are threefold: \u2022 We curate a high-quality Chinese dataset, CCVG, specifically for court view generation. \u2022 We", "view generation.

Prior studies have proposed various tech- niques to enhance the generation of court views by incorporating structured legal information. For example, some works focus on extracting fine- grained legal features such as adjudicating and sentencing circumstances or legal concepts (Yue et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2024) from case facts to improve the informativeness and faithfulness of generated rationales. Others introduce knowledge- aware mechanisms, such as injecting external law articles, charges, and claim information (Ye et al., 2018b; Li and Zhang, 2021) or incorporating legal knowledge bases through prompt tuning and guid- ance (Li et al., 2024). To further address the inter- pretability and fairness of generated texts, several works employ causality-based reasoning, such as counterfactual generation (Wu et al., 2020; Huang and Ouyang, 2023), or introduce modular genera- tion with QA-based slot filling (Huang et al., 2021). These approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating legal structure and knowledge into the generation process. Leveraging Large Language Models in Genera- tion. With the advancement of large-scale PLMs, recent research has begun to explore their poten- tial in court view generation. Some works use general-purpose LLMs to extract intermediate le- gal structures (Yue et al., 2024), while others ex- plore ways to stimulate internal legal knowledge or inject external guidance to improve performance in knowledge-intensive legal domains (Liu et al., 2024). Although these methods demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs in CVG, they mostly rely on general LLMs designed for open-domain tasks and lack models specifically trained for court view generation. Compared to existing methods, our model in- tegrates domain-specific legal reasoning into an end-to-end generation pipeline, offering a compact and efficient solution for CVG. 3 Data Curation Our data curation and model training pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. We begin by collecting Chi- nese legal case documents from China Judgments Online1 spanning from 1985 to 2021. These legal case documents contain rich fact descriptions and court views, which form the basis for our court view generation dataset, CCVG. To construct a high-quality dataset tailored for CVG, we apply a multi-step filtering and preprocessing process. 3.1 Section Extraction Unlike legal documents in common law systems, Chinese legal case documents do not explicitly sep- arate sections such as Facts and Court Views using structural markers. Instead, they are often implied through standard phrases. The Fact section typi- cally begins with phrases such as \"after identifi- cation\". The Court View section often", "documents in common law systems, Chinese legal case documents do not explicitly sep- arate sections such as Facts and Court Views using structural markers. Instead, they are often implied through standard phrases. The Fact section typi- cally begins with phrases such as \"after identifi- cation\". The Court View section often starts with \"the court holds that\". The Decision section gener- ally follows \"in accordance with the law\". Using these lexical cues, we design a set of regular expres- 1https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/ Figure 3: The distribution of charges in train and test sets.

If either the fact or the court view section fails to be successfully extracted, the corresponding sample is discarded. We also split the dataset into train and test sets with a 9:1 ratio. The distribution of case occurrence years in the train and test sets is shown in the Figure 2. 3.2 Charge Extraction In addition, we also extracted the charge type using regular expressions. However, since our primary objective is court view generation, a small portion (0.2%) of the training samples which did not have the charge field successfully extracted are remained. For these samples, we set the \"charge\" field to null. Nevertheless, we ensured that all fields in the test set are non-empty. The distribution of charges is shown in the Figure 3. 3.3 Post Filtering To ensure data quality and compatibility with our model architecture, we apply length-based filter- ing. We discard any sample where either the fact or court view text is shorter than 50 characters or longer than 512 characters after extraction, which helps reduce noise and computational inefficiency. The length statistic of fact and court view in train and test sets are shown in Figure 4 and their de- scriptive statistics presented in the Table 1. Figure 4: The length statistic of fact and court view in train and test sets. The final dataset consists of high-quality, struc- tured document pairs (fact, court view), which we use to fine-tune our language model for the CVG task. 4 Model Training We trained our model using the Swift framework (Zhao et al., 2025), an efficient and flexible toolkit designed for instruction-tuning and fine-tuning LLMs. Swift supports various backends and model families, and offers lightweight abstractions for managing datasets, prompt templates, and train- ing loops, which makes it particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and deployment in legal NLP Models Court View Generation Charge ROUGE BLEU Prediction R-1 R-2 R-L B-1 B-2 B-N Acc MF1 Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct 0.0 0.0 0.0 11.1 6.3 2.9 17.3 29.5 ShiZhi 6.3 0.8 6.3 58.5 51.0 41.7 86.5 92.8 Table 2: Results of court view generation and the charge prediction. applications.

ShiZhi is training based on Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct, a lightweight instruction-tuned Chinese language model with strong performance. We fine-tuned it on our curated dataset, CCVG, using a prompt for- mat tailored for the CVG task. Specifically, we constructed a new system prompt that guides the model to behave as a legal assistant. The fact de- scription is treated as the query and the court view is the expected response as prompt template. Prompt Template {\"system\": \u201cAssume the role of a judge. Based on the fact section of a legal case document, generate the corresponding court view section.\u201d, \"query\": Fact description:\\n {fact}\\n Court View:\", \"response\": {court view}, \"charge\": {charge}} The model was trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 4 and a learning rate of 1e-3. The maximum input length was set to 512 tokens. Training was conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. 5 Experiment Results 5.1 Evaluation Metrics We evaluated our model using a combination of text generation metrics and charge prediction met- rics to comprehensively assess the quality of the generated court views. For text generation, we compute ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L to measure unigram, bigram, and longest common subsequence overlaps between the generated court view and the label, and BLEU-1, BLEU-2, and BLEU-n to assess n-gram precision. To evaluate charge prediction correctness, we measure F1 score and accuracy (Acc). Specifically, for each test case, we check whether the correct charge label appears in the generated court view; if the charge is present, it is counted as correct, otherwise it is considered incorrect. F1 score and accuracy are then computed over the entire test set. This combination of metrics allows us to capture both the linguistic quality and legal fidelity of the generated court views. 5.2 Main Results Table 2 presents the performance of ShiZhi com- pared to the baseline Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct on court view generation and charge prediction. For court view generation, ShiZhi achieves ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores of 6.3, while the baseline scores are 0.0. In terms of BLEU, ShiZhi attains a BLEU-1 of 58.5, markedly higher than the base- line. The observed discrepancy between relatively low ROUGE scores and substantially higher BLEU scores can be attributed to the high lexical vari- ability in court view texts. ROUGE metrics rely on exact n-gram overlap, which penalizes semantically correct outputs that use different wording from the reference. BLEU, by contrast, is more sensitive to partial n-gram matches, capturing alignment in lo- cal phrasing even when the overall wording differs. For charge prediction, ShiZhi achieves 86.1% accuracy and 92.5% macro F1, substantially sur- passing the baseline performance of 17.3% and 29.5%, respectively. These results indicate that domain-specific fine-tuning allows ShiZhi to effec- tively learn the mapping from fact descriptions to charges, reflecting strong legal reasoning capabili- ties.

Overall, the results demonstrate that curating a specialized dataset and fine-tuning a lightweight LLM enables effective generation of court views and accurate charge prediction, while highlighting the challenges of evaluation in highly variable legal text. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we presented ShiZhi, the first large language model specifically designed for Crimi- nal Court View Generation (CVG). We curated CCVG, a dataset of over 110K Chinese criminal cases with fact descriptions paired with court views, and fine-tuned a 0.5B lightweight LLM on this dataset. ShiZhi achieves 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1% accuracy with 92.5% macro F1 on charge prediction, demonstrating that even a small LLM can generate legally coherent and factually grounded court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our model and dataset provide a foundation for future research in automated legal document generation and legal reasoning with LLMs. Limitations Despite the effectiveness of ShiZhi, there are sev- eral limitations in the current work. First, our model and dataset are exclusively in Chinese, lim- iting its applicability to other languages and legal systems. Second, the curated dataset, CCVG, only includes cases up to 2021, which may not reflect the most recent legal developments and case pat- terns. Third, we only explored a single parameter scale (0.5B) for the LLM, without investigating the impact of different model sizes on performance. In future work, we plan to leverage larger and more advanced LLMs as well as updated datasets, in or- der to study their capabilities on CVG and charge prediction tasks, and to systematically analyze how LLMs understand and reason over legal content.

Even the most advanced closed- source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini- 2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry prob- lems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the Interna- tional Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in un- derstanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise tex- tual form, converting visual content into cap- tions offers a promising direction. Moti- vated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Exper- iments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5- VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and iden- tify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure\u2013caption pairs. Cru- cially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint- based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, en- abling reliable assessment of geometric cap- tioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ CapGeo-2042/README.md. 1 Introduction With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), models such as GPT-o3 (Ope- nAI, 2025), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), and agent systems built upon them have demonstrated remarkable deductive abilities on purely textual tasks (Achiam et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2025; Huang and Yang, 2025; Chai et al., 2025). Although MLLMs have achieved promising re- sults across diverse tasks (Bai et al., 2025a; Yao et al., 2024b), multimodal reasoning\u2014particularly the integration of visual and textual informa- tion to derive coherent conclusions\u2014remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. Ge- ometric benchmarks such as MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2024b), MathVista (Lu et al., 2023), and GeoQA (Chen et al., 2021) further underscore this limitation: even state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-o3 and Gemini2.5-Pro (Gemini Team, Google DeepMind, 2025), often struggle to solve geometry- related problems. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate much greater stability and accuracy in text-only rea- soning, as evidenced by their strong performance in competitions such as the International Mathemati- cal Olympiad (IMO) (Huang and Yang, 2025) and International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) (Qiu et al., 2025), where they have attained gold-medal\u2013level results. This stark discrepancy between the exceptional textual reasoning abilities of models like GPT-o3 and Gemini2.5-Pro (Gemini Team, Google Deep- Mind, 2025) and their pronounced weaknesses in multimodal reasoning raises a critical ques- tion: why does the same model perform so dif- ferently in multimodal versus text-only settings? A key factor, we argue, is imperfect visual percep- tion\u2014specifically, the inability to reliably parse and interpret diagrams\u2014which substantially con- strains the effectiveness of multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel caption-assisted reasoning framework, CapGeo, which utilizes au- tomatically generated or human-provided", "so dif- ferently in multimodal versus text-only settings?

High-performance MLLMs include OpenAI\u2019s o3 (OpenAI, 2025), Qwen2.5-VL series (Bai et al., 2025b), and LLaVA series (Liu et al., 2023). Current paradigms for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs encompass (Li et al., 2025): (1) Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) , which employs prompt engineering to guide LLs through step-by-step reasoning pro- cesses (Zhang et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024) ; (2) Multimodal-o1 models (Zhang et al., 2024a; Yao et al., 2024a; Thawakar et al., 2025); (3) Multimodal-R1 mod- els (Liu et al., 2025; Shen et al., 2025) ; (4) Tool- augmented approaches utilizing agent or memory retrieval mechanisms (Li et al., 2024; Gupta and Kembhavi, 2023) ; and (5) Retrieval mechanism that improves reasoning through external knowl- edge integration (Khaliq et al., 2024). 2.2 Geometric Reasoning The research on multimodal geometric reasoning focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, enhanc- ing or evaluating the geometric reasoning ability of existing MLLMs. G-LLAVA (Gao et al., 2023) 2 Data Collection Textbook Exercise OCR Extract Images Data Filtering Experts Review Images ...

Bench- marks such as MathVista (Lu et al., 2023) and MathVision (Wang et al., 2024) assess the geomet- ric reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in multiple geometric domains. On the other hand, research explores the pseudo-visual phenomena of geomet- ric reasoning in existing MLLMs, such as Math- Verse (Zhang et al., 2024b). However, none of these works have focused on whether and how MLLMs can accurately extract information from geometric images within the con- text of multimodal reasoning. To address this issue, we proposed CapGeo. 2.3 Image Captioning Image captioning is a fundamental direction in Computer Vision. Broadly speaking, there are two", "However, none of these works have focused on whether and how MLLMs can accurately extract information from geometric images within the con- text of multimodal reasoning. To address this issue, we proposed CapGeo. 2.3 Image Captioning Image captioning is a fundamental direction in Computer Vision. Broadly speaking, there are two main approaches: (i) direct caption generation. In the era of MLLMs, enhancing the captioning capa- bilities of MLLMs remains a significant focus for many researchers (Zhang et al., 2024c; Lee et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). Meanwhile, the eval- uation of image captions itself has also become an important research direction (Dong et al., 2024; Sarto et al., 2025); (ii) OCR-based methods. For MLLMs, OCR can be regarded as a simplified yet effective form of captioning, since it focuses on extracting pre-existing textual content from images . This capability not only emphasizes information extraction performance (Yang et al., 2021; Mathew et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), but also highlights the reasoning ability required in real-world OCR scenarios (He et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025). Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily tar- get general natural images, leaving the domain of geometric image captioning underexplored. To ad- dress this gap, we propose CapGeo-Bench. 3 CapGeo: Caption-Assisted Geometric Reasoning 3.1 Motivation As shown in Figure 1, while MLLMs excel at tex- tual reasoning, they struggle with geometric prob- lems due to redundant visual tokens that obscure precise geometric relations. Small shifts in figure elements can alter meanings, yet the visual rep- resentation often introduces noise and ambiguity instead of clear logic. In contrast, geometric infor- mation can be expressed concisely and accurately in text. To address this, we propose CapGeo, which converts figures into structured captions with high information density. By replacing redundant visual tokens with precise textual descriptions, CapGeo enhances the model\u2019s comprehension and reason- ing on geometric tasks. 3.2 Captioning Strategy Building on our captioning motivation, this section presents the extraction of captions from geometric figures. A core component of CapGeo is the cap- tioning stage that precedes reasoning. To ensure caption quality, the model is not asked to generate free-form natural language descriptions; instead, it is guided to produce text in the style of a formal mathematical problem. 3 Statistic Value Total images 4,641 - Difficulty 1 1,816 - Difficulty 2 2,133 - Difficulty 3 495 - Difficulty 4 197 - Plane Geometry 4,023 - Analytic Geometry 517 - Solid Geometry 101 Maximum word 586 Average word 61.4 Table 1: CapGeo-Bench Statistics PG 86.7% AG 11.1% SG 2.2% T2 46.0% T1 39.1% T3 10.7% T4 4.2% Figure 3: CapGeo-Bench Data Statistics Chart As shown in Figure 6, we adopt an instruction- based template to direct the captioning process. The model is required to analyze the figure, trans- late its visual content into explicit textual con- straints, and seamlessly integrate these with the original problem statement. 3.3 Caption Assisted Geometric Reasoning After generating the structured caption, the rea- soning model takes the problem statement Q, the original figure I, and the caption C = Caption(I) as joint", "trans- late its visual content into explicit textual con- straints, and seamlessly integrate these with the original problem statement. 3.3 Caption Assisted Geometric Reasoning After generating the structured caption, the rea- soning model takes the problem statement Q, the original figure I, and the caption C = Caption(I) as joint inputs. The reasoning process can be for- mulated as A = MLLM(Q, I, C), where A denotes the predicted answer. The captioning and reasoning prompt are sum- marized in Figure 6. We also evaluate the setting where only Q and C are provided as inputs (see Ta- bles 2 ), which further demonstrates the robustness of purely text-based reasoning for MLLMs. 4 CapGeo-Bench: Grounding Geometric Captioning Ability Although our experiments demonstrate that Cap- Geo is effective in most cases, Table 2 shows that the quality of captioning is critical to the final rea- soning performance. Since geometric captioning is closely tied to the inherent capabilities of the model, we introduce CapGeo-Bench to specifi- cally evaluate and ground the geometric captioning ability of models. 4.1 Benchmark Construction Overview. To bridge the gaps in evaluating the visual geometric information extraction capabili- ties of MLLMs, we designs CapGeo-Bench. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, CapGeo-Bench is a benchmark comprising high-quality 4641 geomet- ric images with corresponding bilingual (Chinese and English) captions, covering 3 geometric classes and 4 difficulty levels. The entire benchmark de- sign process is shown in Figure 2. Data Collection. To minimize potential con- tamination from open-source data, we deliberately avoided using publicly available datasets. Instead, we curated a collection of geometric problems from K-12 textbooks in China, encompassing classic topics such as triangles, parallelograms, and cir- cles, with difficulty levels ranging from middle school exercises to competition problems. The entire collection process was conducted in strict compliance with copyright and licensing regula- tions. We then employed the open-source detection tool DocLayout-YOLO (Zhao et al., 2024) to auto- matically extract geometric diagrams and manually filtered out non-geometric figures. In total, we ob- tained 5,000 high-quality geometric images. Caption Annotation. To guarantee the accuracy and quality of captions, we recruited annotators with STEM backgrounds from Peking University, one of the top universities in China, to perform meticulous manual annotation. All annotators un- derwent rigorous assessments of their mathemati- cal and geometric proficiency, followed by multi- ple rounds of training and pre-annotation exercises to ensure compliance with the required standards. During annotation, mathematics experts designed a unified annotation instruction, including geomet- ric image re-filtering rules and geometric caption annotation principles. The complete procedures of training, pre-annotation, and formal annotation, together with detailed instructions, are provided in Appendix B. 4 Given triangles OAB and OCD, the two areas do not overlap. ...

Covered items in keypoints are marked by italics and underlining. A review team composed of three professional reviewers conducts strict cross-checks on all data annotation results. For annotations that fail the re- view, they will be re-annotated and re-evaluated. See Appendix B for details. We also adhere to labour ethics during the whole annotation process, ensuring all annotators were well-paid, with each receiving 10 dollars per geometric figure annota- tion. In the end, we obtained 4,641 high-quality, contamination-free geometric image\u2013caption pairs. 4.2 Keypoint-by-Keypoint Geometric Caption Quality Evaluation Although there are some metrics for evaluating im- age captions quality (Vedantam et al., 2015; Ander- son et al., 2016), due to the peculiarities of geomet- ric captions, there is still no scientific, quantitative and fine-grained metric for assessing geometric captions quality generated by MLLMs. Geometric figures are composed of basic geo- metric elements through clear relationships. This structural feature determines that geometric cap- tions can be systematically deconstructed into key- points set. This cognition is highly consistent with the core idea of Geometric Formal Language (Lu et al., 2021). Based on this, we design a keypoint- by-keypoint geometric caption evaluation method with three dimensional evaluation metrics and cor- responding evaluation framework. Evaluation Metrics. The abstract combina- tion of geometric points, lines, and letters conveys rich elemental, spatial, and numerical information. Thus, for MLLMs\u2019 captioning capability, we focus on the following three dimensional metrics: (1) Elements: evaluate whether MLLMs can com- prehensively identify all elements and their corre- sponding letter identifiers. The elements include basic shapes, lines, points, coordinate axes, etc. In Figure 4, Elements in Captions are underlined. (2) Spatial Relations: evaluate whether MLLMs can comprehensively identify all spatial relations and their corresponding subjects. For specific de- tails, See in", "prehensively identify all elements and their corre- sponding letter identifiers. The elements include basic shapes, lines, points, coordinate axes, etc. In Figure 4, Elements in Captions are underlined. (2) Spatial Relations: evaluate whether MLLMs can comprehensively identify all spatial relations and their corresponding subjects. For specific de- tails, See in Appendix C. In Figure 4, Spatial Rela- tions in Captions are in italics. (3) Numerical Relations: evaluate whether the MLLMs can comprehensively identify all the nu- merical relationships and their corresponding sub- jects. Like length, angle, etc. Evaluation Framework. As shown in Figure 4, we decompose the evaluation framework into three major steps: (1) Extract geometric elements key- points set E, spatial relation keypoints set R, nu- merical relation keypoints set N from both model response captions Tc and ground truth Tg by LLM. 5 Reasoning Model Captioning Model w/o GPT-4o GPT-o3 Qwen2.5-VL -72B-Instruct Qwen2.5-VL -7B-Instruct w img w/o img w img w/o img w img w/o img w img w/o img w img Vision Only Claude-Opus-4-20250514 44.8 51.8 48.5 59.4 73.0 60.9 57.9 29.7 36.7 Gemini-2.5-pro 66.4 57.1 56.6 60.3 73.6 62.2 60.5 37.2 37.8 GPT-o3 74.6 54.6 67.8 60.3 75.8 60.3 64.6 28.7 37.3 Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct 8.6 51.1 59.0 66.1 66.4 57.0 56.6 33.6 36.4 Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 7.1 45.9 51.5 61.9 60.0 52.7 49.4 31.0 35.2 DeepSeek-R1 \u2013 57.1 \u2013 68.2 \u2013 62.3 \u2013 36.5 \u2013 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct \u2013 50.6 \u2013 66.1 \u2013 54.8 \u2013 31.2 \u2013 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \u2013 47.1 \u2013 63.3 \u2013 53.4 \u2013 31.5 \u2013 Vision Intensive Claude-Opus-4-20250514 61.8 75.0 76.7 79.3 85.5 74.1 68.9 74.1 47.5 Gemini-2.5-pro 79.6 76.1 78.0 83.0 85.4 77.9 59.0 75.1 47.3 GPT-o3 73.0 76.3 81.3 82.5 78.3 76.3 60.0 75.4 46.6 Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct 58.0 66.5 64.8 74.9 72.6 70.3 71.6 62.6 62.7 Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 43.3 61.5 60.8 63.2 60.3 67.4 70.2 60.8 62.7 DeepSeek-R1 \u2013 73.9 \u2013 71.9 \u2013 75.3 \u2013 70.1 \u2013 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct \u2013 65.6 \u2013 73.2 \u2013 69.7 \u2013 62.3 \u2013 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \u2013 60.2 \u2013 65.9 \u2013 68.3 \u2013 62.3 \u2013 Table 2: Performance comparison of various MLLMs and LLMs on Vision Only and Vision Intensive tasks in MathVerse, under w and w/o image settings, with different Captioning Models. This can be expressed by the formula as E, R, N = LLMextract(T) See Figure 7 and Figure 8 for prompts for ground truth and model response caption three dimensional keypoints extraction. (2) Identify covered items between ground truth keypoints and model response caption keypoints. Due to the varied expressions in natural language, performing a direct intersection operation is rough and insufficient. Therefore, we design prompt and employ LLM to perform semantically equivalent covered items extraction between the model re- sponse caption and ground truth keypoints set for each dimension. This process identifies semanti- cally equivalent keypoints, which constitute the TP set for that dimension. This can be expressed by the formula as TPE = Ec \u2229Eg = LLMmatch(Ec, Eg) See Figure 9 for prompt for covered three dimen- sional keypoints extraction of LLMmatch.

(3) The score S for each dimension is calculated as recall, determining whether the ground truth keypoints appears in the model response caption keypoints. This metric measures the comprehen- siveness of information of model response captions. This can be expressed by the formula as SE = |TPE| |Eg| , SR = |TPR| |Rg| , SN = |TPN| |Ng| , We submitted the complete evaluation process of 200 geometric captions to three domain experts for independent review. The experts confirmed the validity and reliability of the evaluation processes, which verified the rationality of our method. 5 Experiments We first conduct comprehensive experiments in Section 5.2 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the caption-based strategy for enhancing MLLM rea- soning on mathematical problems. To further evalu- ate the captioning capabilities of different MLLMs, we perform a systematic evaluation on CapGeo- Bench in Section 5.3. 5.1 Experimental Setup Models In CapGeo experiments, We distinguish between two types of models in our experi- ments: captioning models and reasoning mod- els. For captioning models, we adopt GPT- 4o (Hurst et al., 2024), ChatGPT-o3 (OpenAI, 6 Model MathVista GeoQA - GPT-o3 GPT-4o Qwen-72B Qwen-7B - GPT-o3 GPT-4o Qwen-72B Qwen-7B Claude-Opus-4-20250514 76.1 89.4 65.7 91.7 88.4 57.0 92.0 91.0 92.5 91.5 Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 94.9 96.3 95.8 98.1 97.7 90.0 95.0 96.5 97.0 97.5 GPT-4o 61.6 65.7 62.0 63.9 62.5 61.0 63.0 63.0 62.5 57.5 GPT-o3 93.1 94.9 94.0 94.4 95.8 92.5 94.5 94.5 93.5 95.0 Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct 75.9 92.6 91.7 92.1 70.4 68.5 73.5 72.0 70.0 73.5 Table 3: Comparison of MLLMs on MathVista and GeoQA benchmarks with different captioning models. 2025), Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5- VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025b). For reason- ing models, we evaluate a broad range of MLLMs and LLMs, including Claude-Opus-4 (Anthropic, 2025), Gemini-2.5-pro (Gemini Team, Google DeepMind, 2025), ChatGPT-o3, Qwen2.5-VL- 72B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, DeepSeek- R1 (Guo et al., 2025), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025a). In CapGeo-Bench experiments, we selected GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as evaluation models and Gemini-2.5-pro as the as the base model for extract- ing keypoints and matching in section 4.2. Benchmarks To systematically evaluate the ca- pability of our CapGeo framework, we conduct experiments on the following three benchmarks: MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2024b), MathVista (Lu et al., 2023), and GeoQA (Chen et al., 2021). For MathVerse, we use the Vision-Only and Vision- Intensive variants to assess the role of visual input. For MathVista, we focus on the subset containing geometry-related problems. For GeoQA, which includes 4,998 geometric problems, we randomly sample 200 problems to balance evaluation cover- age and computational cost. For geometric captioning ability, we further eval- uate the models on our CapGeo-Bench. Settings For local model inference, we employed the VLLM framework (Kwon et al., 2023). The model temperature was fixed at 0.0 to minimize ran- domness and ensure stable reasoning performance. 5.2 CapGeo: Enhancing Geometric Reasoning We evaluate each model under two modes: (1) Direct-Vision mode, where MLLMs directly rea-", "CapGeo-Bench. Settings For local model inference, we employed the VLLM framework (Kwon et al., 2023). The model temperature was fixed at 0.0 to minimize ran- domness and ensure stable reasoning performance. 5.2 CapGeo: Enhancing Geometric Reasoning We evaluate each model under two modes: (1) Direct-Vision mode, where MLLMs directly rea- son with original images and questions; and (2) Caption-Assisted mode, where visual information from figures is first extracted by a captioning model and then passed to a MLLM or LLM for reasoning As shown in Tables 2 and 3, caption-assisted inference consistently outperforms direct vision- based reasoning across the three benchmarks with the strong captioning model, such as captions generated by GPT-o3. For instance, on Math- Verse (Vision-Only setting), open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct improves from 8.6% to 66.4% when augmented with captions generated by GPT-o3. In contrast, strong closed-source mod- els such as GPT-o3 and Gemini already achieve high baseline performance (74.6% and 66.4%, re- spectively) and therefore exhibit smaller gains. On MathVista, captioning enables mid-performing open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct to improves from 75.9% to 92.6%, closing the gap with SOTA closed model GPT-o3 (94.9%). Simi- larly, on GeoQA, MLLMs also demonstrate similar experimental results. These results highlight three key findings: (1)With caption-assisted, performance of MLLMs improve significantly, verifying that the bottleneck of geometric reasoning lies in visual understand- ing rather than reasoning; (2) For closed-source MLLMs with superior performance, captions still yield incremental gains, confirming the robustness of the strategy; (3) LLMs with caption reach perfor- mance close to MLLMs, suggesting that captions contain sufficient information to support reasoning. 5.3 CapGeo-Bench: Detecting Good Captioner for CapGeo Detecting Good Captioner for CapGeo. As shown in Table 4, GPT-o3 achieves 63.4%, 56.1% and 26.0% across the three-dimensional scores re- spectively, demonstrating the best performance.

Moreover, difficulty-based analysis reveals a consistent performance drop across all three di- mensions as difficulty level increases, with mod- els such as GPT-o3 and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct even failing entirely on the Numerical Score at the highest difficulty level. Plane Geometry remains especially challenging, underscoring the limited ability of MLLMs to extract information in highly abstract and symbolic visual content. Collectively, these results highlight the substan- tial gap between current MLLM capabilities and the requirements of robust geometric captioning. By introducing CapGeo-Bench, we provide a rigor- ous and challenging benchmark that establishes a new standard for the geometric captioning commu- nity, encouraging future research to address these persistent limitations. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we tackled the challenge of geomet- ric reasoning in MLLMs by introducing CapGeo, a caption-assisted framework that transforms dia- grams into concise and faithful textual descriptions. Our experiments demonstrated that supplement- ing visual input with captions leads to dramatic gains across state-of-the-art models, confirming that the primary obstacle lies in diagram under- standing rather than reasoning capacity. To sup- port this direction, we further introduced CapGeo- Bench, a high-quality dataset of geometric fig- ures paired with expert-curated captions. Unlike prior resources, CapGeo-Bench is equipped with a keypoint-based evaluation metric that provides fine- grained and reliable assessment of caption quality, and its scores show strong correlation with down- stream reasoning performance in CapGeo. This makes CapGeo-Bench not only a valuable bench- mark but also a practical tool for detecting and de- veloping high-quality geometric captioning models. Together, CapGeo and CapGeo-Bench establish a foundation for bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities, paving the way for future ad- vances in multimodal geometric reasoning. 8 References Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia", "tool for detecting and de- veloping high-quality geometric captioning models.

In European Conference on Computer Vi- sion, pages 73\u201390. Springer. 11 A Prompt Appendix In this section, we have detailedly listed all the prompts used in the experiments of the articles. In CapGeo, prompts related to captioning and reason- ing are involved in Figure 7. In CapGeo-Bench, the prompt related to captioning is involved in Fig- ure 7, the prompt for keyword extraction during the evaluation process is involved in Figure 8, and the prompt for covered keypoints extraction is in- volved in Figure 9. All prompts have been carefully and scientifically designed and iterated through ex- periments, and have been guided and verified by domain experts, resulting in excellent final effects. B Annotation Instructions To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the an- notated data, we adopted a rigorous selection and training process for annotators. Specifically, we re- cruited candidates from top universities and ranked them based on their high school mathematics per- formance and scores on geometry reasoning tests, ensuring sufficient mathematical reasoning and ge- ometric spatial understanding capabilities. Before undertaking the actual annotation tasks, candidates went through two rounds of training and pre-annotation. In the first stage, we pro- vided comprehensive instruction covering the an- notation objectives, guidelines, workflow, and qual- ity standards, illustrated with detailed examples. Candidates were then required to perform pre- annotations on 10 geometric figures, which were reviewed by expert examiners. The examiners iden- tified both individual and common issues, which were subsequently addressed in a second training session. Afterward, candidates completed another round of pre-annotation and review. Only those who successfully passed both evaluations were qualified as final annotators. During the annotation process, annotators were required to follow a rigorous workflow. First, they assessed the quality and content of the image to determine whether it was a valid geometric figure; images that did not meet the criteria were discarded. Next, annotators evaluated the type and difficulty level of the geometric figure.", "annotation process, annotators were required to follow a rigorous workflow. First, they assessed the quality and content of the image to determine whether it was a valid geometric figure; images that did not meet the criteria were discarded. Next, annotators evaluated the type and difficulty level of the geometric figure. Finally, annotators carefully examined the construction logic, spatial relations, and numerical information of the figure, and produced a logically structured caption that covered all information in the image without intro- ducing subjective hallucinations. For highly com- plex figures or when necessary, annotators were instructed to consult the original descriptions in the source PDF to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the final annotations. In the annotation process, annotators were re- quired to strictly adhere to unified guidelines de- signed by mathematics experts. Specifically, redun- dant, undescribable, or low-quality images were to be discarded. All captions had to be strictly grounded in the visual content of the figure, without introducing subjective interpretation or speculation. Geometric terminology was required to remain con- sistent, ensuring standardization and reproducibil- ity across annotations. Captions were expected to go beyond surface-level elements and capture es- sential geometric attributes or spatial relations (e.g., for a midpoint, not merely stating that a point lies on a line, but explicitly indicating its geometric sig- nificance). Furthermore, annotations were required to follow a hierarchical structure, prioritizing infor- mation according to geometric construction logic rather than presenting items indiscriminately. Fi- nally, fine-grained details such as dashed lines, col- ored segments, and area representations were also mandated to be annotated, ensuring comprehensive and precise descriptions. To further ensure the quality and consistency of the annotations, we implemented a rigorous cross- review mechanism. All annotation results were in- dependently examined by a review panel consisting of three expert evaluators. For samples that failed the initial review, re-annotations were conducted by different members of the annotation team, and the revised results were resubmitted for review. This iterative process of cross-annotation and review ef- fectively ensured both accuracy and consistency of the final annotations. We adhere to labour ethics during the whole an- notation process, ensuring all annotators were well- paid, with each receiving 10 dollars per geometric figure annotation. C Spatial Relations To comprehensively extract the spatial relations in the caption, we have classified the following spatial relationship classification system based on the com- position of the relationship subjects. We believe that the following contents all fall within the scope of spatial relations. This system encompasses five core types of relationships: (1) The Point-Line Relations describe the posi- tional dependence between points and lines: Mid- 12 point, Foot of the perpendicular, Intersection point, Trisection point, Endpoint; (2) The Line-Line Relations depict the relation- ship between line elements: Perpendicular, Parallel, Oblique intersection, Coincidence; (3) The Line-Shape Relations characterize the structural connection between a straight line and complex geometric shapes: Angle bisector, Diago- nal, Median, Altitude, Chord, Tangent, Diameter; (4) The Point-Shape Relations define the char- acteristic position of a point relative to a complex figure: Centroid, Orthocenter, Circumcenter, Incen- ter, Vertex, Circle center; (5) The Shape-Shape Relations", "characterize the structural connection between a straight line and complex geometric shapes: Angle bisector, Diago- nal, Median, Altitude, Chord, Tangent, Diameter; (4) The Point-Shape Relations define the char- acteristic position of a point relative to a complex figure: Centroid, Orthocenter, Circumcenter, Incen- ter, Vertex, Circle center; (5) The Shape-Shape Relations describe the macroscopic spatial configuration among complete geometric figures: Disjoint, Tangency, Intersection, Containment, Congruence, Similarity, Concentric, Inscribed, Circumscribed. 13 CapGeo and CapGeo-Bench Captioning prompt MathVerse Vision Intensive: Based on the provided geometric figure and the following question text, please describe the complete geometric math problem in a clear and structured format.

This study addresses the significant challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer\u2019s voice in interactions with operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario. This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential prob- lems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation methodologies1. Index Terms\u2014 target speaker anonymization (TSA), privacy, automatic speech recognition (ASR), automatic speaker verification (ASV), target speaker extraction (TSE), speaker diarization 1. INTRODUCTION The extensive deployment of spoken language technologies raises substantial privacy concerns and development of regulatory frame- works such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1]. Voice recordings is a rich source of personal informa- tion; beyond merely identifying an individual, speech data contains sensitive attributes like age, gender, health status, emotional state, personality traits, ethnic origin, and socioeconomic standing. To address the privacy challenges, voice anonymization has emerged as a critical and prevalent methodology for protecting the privacy of speech data. Anonymization aims at suppressing the personally identifiable traits of a speaker, while preserving the linguistic and some paralinguistic content [2]. Voice anonymization techniques include two broad categories of methods: signal processing-based methods [3\u20136], that employ simple signal transformations to alter voice characteristics; and neural voice conversion methods [7\u201315], that operate by disentangling various speech attributes \u2014 such as content, speaker characteristics, pitch, and emotion \u2014 before selec- tively anonymizing specific attributes and reconstructing the speech signal using speech synthesis models. Previous research on speaker anonymization has focused pri- marily on single-speaker audio scenarios, which has shaped the This work was done in the context of the Inria-NII TrustedSpeech As- sociate Team and was supported by the French National Research Agency under project Speech Privacy and project IPoP of the Cybersecurity PEPR. Experiments were carried out using the Grid\u20195000 testbed. 1Audio samples are available at https://sites.google.com/ view/target-speaker-anonymization development of anonymization techniques and evaluation metrics specifically tailored to these contexts. In contrast, this study ad- dresses the challenge of speaker anonymization in conversational audio, specifically focusing on scenarios where only one particular speaker within a multi-speaker dialogue needs to be anonymized. This scenario is particularly common in call centers, where conver- sations between customers and operators are recorded, but only the customer\u2019s voice needs to be anonymized to protect their privacy. Conventional anonymization methods fall short in this scenario as they cannot selectively target individual speakers within conver-", "to be anonymized. This scenario is particularly common in call centers, where conver- sations between customers and operators are recorded, but only the customer\u2019s voice needs to be anonymized to protect their privacy. Conventional anonymization methods fall short in this scenario as they cannot selectively target individual speakers within conver- sations. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are insufficient for accurately measuring both privacy protection and audio util- ity in these specific contexts. The only existing work related to multi-speaker anonymization [16] proposes an initial attempt to provide a multi-speaker anonymization benchmark, however, while the potential privacy leakage caused by overlapping segments is ac- knowledged by the authors, the proposed practical solution is limited to non-overlapping conversations. More realistic and challenging scenarios include conversations with interfering speech of multiple speakers [17] that is the main focus of the current research. The key contributions of this work are the following: (i) in- troduction of a novel target speaker anonymization framework, specifically designed to address privacy preservation challenges within multi-speaker conversations; (ii) development of an evalua- tion methodology for assessing both privacy protection and utility preservation in anonymized speech; (iii) experimental investigations leveraging two state-of-the-art target speaker extraction methods and an anonymization technique, analyzing their performance across di- verse overlapped speech conditions and the inherent limitations and challenges of the proposed models. 2. TARGET SPEAKER ANONYMIZATION To address the challenges of privacy protection in multi-speaker conversations, we propose a novel framework called target speaker anonymization (TSA) for selectively anonymizing a specific speaker in multi-speaker recordings. To achieve speaker anonymization for only the target speaker, we propose a pipeline approach that combines target speaker extraction (TSE) [18] with speaker voice anonymization techniques of only the designated target speaker. TSE focuses on isolating the speech of the designated target speaker from overlapped multi-talker speech \u2014 a common chal- lenge often referred to as the \u201ccocktail party problem\u201d. By accu- rately extracting the target speaker\u2019s voice, subsequent anonymiza- tion steps can be applied effectively without affecting other speakers in the recording. The overview of the TSA is illustrated in Fig. 1 for a common scenario for a two-speaker recording that features a user (designated as Speaker A) and a call center operator (desig- nated as Speaker B). In this illustrative example, the user (Speaker A) is identified as the target speaker, meaning their voice will un- arXiv:2510.09307v1 [eess.AS] 10 Oct 2025 User: Speaker A Mixture speech Target speaker extraction Speaker A embedding Anonymization Mixture speech Mask A Mask B Anonymized speech Operator: Speaker B Original speech 1 2 Speech combination 3 Fig. 1.

The operator (Speaker B), conversely, is a non-target speaker whose speech will remain in its original, non-anonymized form to maintain operational clarity and context. TSA includes three main steps: (1) Target speaker extraction (TSE).

TSE typically involves estimating a complex-valued soft mask (denoted as Mask A in Fig. 1) for the time-frequency spec- tral bins containing the target speaker, using a pre-provided neural speaker embedding vector.

(2) Anonymization of the voice of the target Speaker A. (3) Com- bination of the anonymized speech waveform of the target speaker and the (residual) speech waveform of Speaker B which remains non-anonymized. By effectively isolating the target speaker from the mixed audio at Step 1, we ensure that their speech is cleanly extracted. This al- lows us to then perform speaker anonymization at Step 2 exclusively on these extracted segments, maintaining privacy for the target indi- vidual without affecting other voices or sounds in the conversation. 3. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY This section introduces enhanced evaluation metrics designed to specifically measure both privacy protection and utility preservation in target speaker-aware anonymization scenarios. 3.1. Privacy assessment Beyond integrating target speaker extraction and anonymization techniques, we must improve evaluation metrics for privacy protec- tion. Traditionally, privacy has been assessed by confirming that anonymized speech cannot be linked to the original speaker using equal error rate (EER) with automatic speaker verification (ASV) models [2] that are considered as attack systems. This evaluation remains crucial when the extracted speech contains only the target speaker. However, imperfections in target speaker extraction may leave residual speaker information in time-frequency bins that aren\u2019t properly masked. Attackers could potentially exploit these residuals to re-identify the original speaker. 3.2. Utility assessment Evaluating the utility of anonymized speech is crucial alongside pri- vacy protection. Regarding utility, it is essential that anonymized speech remains functional for downstream tasks. A primary con- cern is ensuring that anonymized speech remains intelligible when mixed with other speakers, allowing accurate transcription by au- tomatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Additionally, we must ensure that anonymized speech within multi-speaker recordings can still support effective speaker diarization. This capability is essential in practical applications like call center analytics, where distinguish- ing between different speakers remains important. Our framework must therefore be evaluated both on ASR performance and compati- bility with speaker diarization systems. These utility metrics collec- tively ensure that anonymized speech maintains its practical value for real-world applications while protecting the privacy of the target speaker. 3.2.1. Primary utility metric Traditionally, in a single-speaker audio voice anonymization sce- nario, objective utility evaluation relies on the word error rate (WER) metric, which is obtained by computing decoding errors of the ASR system. However, in multi-speaker recordings, the task becomes more intricate, as anonymization must not only preserve the content spoken by the target speaker but also maintain the intelligibility of other speakers and the overall conversational flow. Therefore, TSA requires a more comprehensive evaluation metric. As a primary util- ity metric to evaluate verbal content preservation for all speakers in the mixture obtained by TSA, we consider a minimum-permutation word error rate (cpWER) [19] obtained", "also maintain the intelligibility of other speakers and the overall conversational flow. Therefore, TSA requires a more comprehensive evaluation metric. As a primary util- ity metric to evaluate verbal content preservation for all speakers in the mixture obtained by TSA, we consider a minimum-permutation word error rate (cpWER) [19] obtained by speaker-attributed ASR [20]. The tcpWER is computed using the meeting transcription eval- uation toolkit MeetEval [21]2 as follows: (i) All utterances for each speaker are concatenated in both the reference and hypothesis files. (ii) The WER is then computed by comparing the reference to ev- ery possible speaker permutation of the hypothesis. (iii) The lowest WER among these permutations is selected, representing the optimal speaker alignment. More specifically, we consider time-constrained minimum-permutation word error rate (tcpWER), that is a variation of cpWER with incorporated temporal constraints into the Leven- shtein distance used for WER computation [21]. By utilizing tem- poral information, the tcpWER prevents the matching of words that are temporally distant, thus offering a more accurate assessment of speech transcription quality. Consequently, the tcpWER is directly and significantly affected by the accuracy of speaker diarization re- sults. 3.2.2. Auxiliary utility metrics Beyond tcpWER, our primary utility metric, to evaluate the interme- diate steps of the pipeline and gain deeper insights into overall per- formance and the influence of different system components, we an- alyze additional metrics: (i) Diarization error rate (DER). Effective speaker diarization, which involves identifying \u201cwho spoke when\u201d, is a crucial utility metric. The anonymized audio must still allow for accurate segmentation of speech by speaker and correct assign- ment of speaker labels. (ii) WER of the ASR system for anonymized speech signal of the target speaker (after Step 2 in Fig. 1 and before combining speech signals). 2https://github.com/fgnt/meeteval 3.3. TSE quality assessment In the considered privacy preservation scenario, both the user and attacker should efficiently utilize TSE models to perform their re- spective tasks. The quality of TSE impacts both the privacy and utility of the anonymized speech, which is evaluated using privacy and utility metrics. As an additional intermediate metric for estimat- ing TSE quality, we employ the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio SI-SDR [22]. SI-SDR quantifies how accurately the separated speech signal matches the original reference signal, while inherently accounting for any scaling differences between them. A higher pos- itive SI-SDR value signifies superior separation quality, indicating that the TSE model is more effective at isolating the target speaker\u2019s voice. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1. Evaluation data Experiments were conducted on the SparseLibri2Mix subset of the open-source dataset SparseLibriMix3 [17]. This dataset was designed by combining recordings of two speakers from the Lib- riSpeech test-clean subset to create more realistic, conversation-like scenarios, featuring 5 different overlapping versions (conditions): 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% overlap. This dataset includes 500 mixture files per condition (500 \u00b7 5 = 2500 mixture files corre- sponding to about 5 hours of speech in total) from 40 speakers. For our analysis, the first speaker in a mixture is designated as the target speaker, whose voice is to be anonymized and the second speaker is", "mixture files per condition (500 \u00b7 5 = 2500 mixture files corre- sponding to about 5 hours of speech in total) from 40 speakers. For our analysis, the first speaker in a mixture is designated as the target speaker, whose voice is to be anonymized and the second speaker is considered the non-target speaker, whose voice remains unchanged4. For TSE experiments, an utterance (not present in the mixture files) from the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset was randomly selected for a reference speaker in each mixture file to compute target speaker embeddings. For ASV experiments, 15 utterances from the Lib- riSpeech test-clean dataset were used for each speaker to compute enrollment speaker embeddings. The set of enrollment utterances was disjoint from the utterances used in the mixtures. Thus, the total number of trials per condition is 20000: 500 same-speaker trials and 19500 different-speaker trials. 4.2. Anonymization system For experiments, as an example anonymization system, we use one of the strongest in terms of privacy anonymization baseline systems from the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge [23], that is based on us- ing acoustic vector quantized bottleneck (VQ-BN) features extracted from an ASR acoustic model. This system, denoted in [23] as B5, provides an enhanced disentanglement of speaker identity from lin- guistic content through vector quantization. The pipeline extracts pitch and acoustic VQ-BN features. These features, combined with a designated speaker identity (represented as a one-hot vector corre- sponding to a speaker from the training dataset (train-clean-100 Lib- riTTS), are then directly used to synthesize an anonymized speech waveform through a HiFi-GAN network. Data anonymization in all experiments was performed on the utterance level. 4.3. Target speaker extraction models For our experiments, we utilized two distinct TSE models to investi- gate how the quality of separated speech impacts TSA performance. The two models were chosen in the preliminary experiments from 3https://github.com/popcornell/SparseLibriMix 4First and second speakers in the mixtures are denoted as s1 and s2 re- spectively in the SparseLibriMix corpus release3 Original Anonymized EER,% 3.0 32.4 WER, % 2.7 6.0 Table 1.

Conformer-based TSE The conformer [25] architecture is efficient for processing speech signals because it effectively combines two key mechanisms: convo- lutional layers and self-attention, that allow to capture fine-grained, local patterns as well as more global dependencies in a speech sig- nal. We use a conformer-based TSE model proposed in [24,26] that processes the time-frequency domain short-term Fourier transform (STFT) spectrum of the mixture audio. The conformer-based TSE model reconstructs the real and imaginary components of the target speaker\u2019s STFT spectrum, effectively isolating their speech. To iden- tify and focus on the target speaker, the conformer blocks also incor- porate speaker embeddings extracted from reference audio samples using a separate, pre-trained", "of the mixture audio. The conformer-based TSE model reconstructs the real and imaginary components of the target speaker\u2019s STFT spectrum, effectively isolating their speech. To iden- tify and focus on the target speaker, the conformer blocks also incor- porate speaker embeddings extracted from reference audio samples using a separate, pre-trained speaker encoder. The model was trained on the Libri2Mix [17] and Libri2Vox [24] training datasets. 4.3.2. WeSep band-split recurrent neural network (BSRNN) TSE The BSRNN TSE model [27, 28] operates by explicitly dividing the audio spectrogram into multiple, distinct frequency bands. This granular approach allows for incredibly fine-grained modeling of each band\u2019s unique spectral characteristics. In this work, we use an implementation of the BSRNN model5 from the WeSep toolkit [18]. 4.4. Evaluation models 4.4.1. Attack models The ASV system used for privacy evaluation is taken from the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge official evaluation setup [23]. It is an ECAPA-TDNN model [29] with 512 channels in the convolution frame layers, implemented by adapting the SpeechBrain [30] Vox- Celeb recipe to LibriSpeech train-clean-360 dataset. We consider a semi-informed attacker, who has access to the anonymization sys- tem under evaluation. Using that system, the attacker anonymizes the original enrollment data so as to reduce the mismatch with the anonymized trial data. In addition, the attacker anonymizes the training dataset and retrains the ASV system on it, so that it is adapted to this specific anonymization system. For a given speaker, all enrollment utterances are used to compute an average speaker vector for enrollment. In this privacy preservation scenario, we assume that attackers have access to the mixture speech signal after TSA, thus they need first to extract target speaker information from 5https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wesep/blob/master/ wesep/models/bsrnn.py Step Metric,% Data 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Aver 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Aver Original tcpWER orig 4.3 4.3 4.5 4.6 7.2 5.0 mixture DER orig 27.5 17.6 9.5 4.8 5.4 12.9 Conformer TSE WeSep BSRNN TSE 1.

ASR and diarization models For utility assessment of the output TSA mixture signal, includ- ing the computation of tcpWER and DER metrics, we utilized a diarization-conditioned Whisper for target speaker ASR (DiCoW) proposed in [20] with DiariZen6 diarization model. DiariZen uses local end-to-end neural diarization followed by speaker embed- ding clustering with pyannote [31]. In addition, we employed the VoicePrivacy 2024 ASR evaluation model to evaluate the ability of the anonymization system to leave the linguistic content undistorted in the anonymized speech of the target speaker before combin- ing it with the non-target speaker\u2019s speech. This ASR model was fine-tuned on LibriSpeech-train-960 from wav2vec2-large-960h- lv60-self using SpeechBrain. 5. RESULTS 5.1. Single-speaker scenario This section reports auxiliary experiments for the privacy and util- ity evaluation of the target speaker\u2019s reference speech in single- speaker recordings (prior to mixing). These experiments aim to understand the performance and potential limitations of the con- sidered anonymization algorithm, informing the expected results for multi-speaker TSA. The WER and EER results for original and anonymized data are reported in Tab. 1. 5.2. Performance of TSE models The SI-SDR results of the two TSE models for all overlap conditions are presented in Tab. 2. Both models demonstrate a decrease in SI- SDR with an increasing percentage of overlap. The WeSep BSRNN yields better results than Conformer TSE for all conditions. 5.3. Utility and privacy TSA assessment The summary results are reported in Tab. 3 for primary metrics (EER and tcpWER, highlighted in gray), as well as for different steps of TSA, for original and anonymized speech. The first two lines show tcpWER and DER results for the original mixtures. Step in the first column corresponds to the step in the TSA pipeline (see Sec. 2 and Fig. 1). 6https://github.com/Lakoc/DiariZen Results for Step 1 on original data indicate that TSE degrades both EER and WER with respect to the original signal in the mixture (as shown in Tab. 1). Specifically, Conformer TSE resulted in an average absolute degradation of 2.7% for EER and 11.8% for WER. WeSep BSRNN TSE showed a smaller degradation, with an average absolute change of 1.6% for EER and 8.4% for WER. After anonymization (Step 2), EER is similar across all condi- tions and closely aligns with the single-channel anonymized results (Tab. 1). We observe a significant increase in WER on anonymized data. The primary cause of this increased WER is insertion errors, which arise from residual signals from the non-target speaker due to imperfect separation. To address the high WER, potential so- lutions include implementing improved voice activity masking for non-target speaker segments, or jointly training the ASR and TSE models. tcpWER and DER calculated at Step 3 on the resulted mix- ture signal from TSA, show similar trends for both TSE models, while WeSep BSRNN consistently outperforms Conformer TSE.

The privacy evaluation results, shown in the last row, were ob- tained under the assumption of a semi-informed attacker who has access to anonymized enrollment and training data. Such an attacker first extracts the target speaker\u2019s voice from the mixture and then ap- plies an ASV system to the extracted signal. In these experiments, an attacker applies the same TSE model as the user. Two main op- tions for signal extraction were considered: using the original ref- erence and using an anonymized reference. The evaluation focused on two key factors: how much information from the original signal of the target speaker remains in the mixture and how effective the anonymized reference is for TSE. In our experiments, the best re- sults for both TSE were obtained when using the original speech for extraction. Among all tested configurations, this approach yielded the best result (i.e. the strongest attack) and is reported in the table. On average, the EER is approximately 36\u221237%, which is 12\u221214% relatively higher than for a single-channel scenario. 6. CONCLUSIONS This research proposes a novel TSA framework specifically designed for privacy preservation in complex multi-speaker conversations. We established an evaluation methodology to assess both the privacy and utility of anonymized speech, and to identify inherent system limita- tions and challenges. Experimental results indicate a notable degra- dation in overall tcpWER for the best TSE model. While privacy improved and the EER was around 36-37%, this EER, however, sug- gests potential for improvement in attacker capabilities or evaluation metrics. Our experiments highlighted main challenges, including the need for improved utility, which may require more efficient TSE jointly trained with ASR objectives. 7.

Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional atten- tion in dLLMs demands large memory foot- print, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Ex- isting cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteris- tics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache evic- tion framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask- query guided scoring mechanism that lever- ages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that im- proves efficiency by reducing allocation in in- termediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31 \u00d7 acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available as an open-source project.1 1 Introduction Over the past few years, autoregressive language models have dominated text generation (Zhao et al., 2023), but their strictly left-to-right decoding en- forces sequential inference and limits through- put. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lift the latency ceiling by iteratively denoising a fully masked sequence, enabling parallel predic- tion of all tokens with bidirectional attention for *Equal contribution. \u2020Corresponding author. 1https://github.com/jianuo-huang/MaskKV richer contextual reasoning (Gemini, 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). Closed-source systems such as Gemini Diffusion (Gemini, 2025) and Mercury (Khanna et al., 2025) have already pushed this paradigm to production scale, sustain- ing thousand-token-per-second decoding and prov- ing its commercial viability. Open-source counter- parts, LLaDA-8B (trained from scratch) (Nie et al., 2025) and Dream-7B (initialized from AR) (Ye et al., 2025), perform comparably to ARMs of simi- lar scale on downstream tasks, confirming diffusion as a competitive architecture for text generation. To reduce redundant computation in the itera- tive denoising process, cache mechanisms tailored for bidirectional attention have been proposed (Liu et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025). Unlike ARMs, which only main- tain and reuse key\u2013value (KV) states for past to- kens, dLLMs must recompute and cache features for the entire sequence at every denoising step, in- cluding the input prompt, generated tokens, and masked tokens. This design amplifies both the storage and update cost of caches, introducing sig- nificant memory and runtime overhead (Hu et al., 2025).

This design amplifies both the storage and update cost of caches, introducing sig- nificant memory and runtime overhead (Hu et al., 2025). While eviction strategies have been exten- sively studied in ARMs (Zhang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024), they largely depend on causal atten- tion over past tokens and thus cannot be directly applied to dLLMs, where bidirectional attention also accesses undecoded positions. The few ex- isting efforts for dLLMs mainly focus on block diffusion (Wu et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025), but these approaches sacrifice parallelism and require repeated attention computations, undermining po- tential acceleration. These differences between ARMs and dLLMs render existing eviction strategies ineffective and necessitate a rethinking of cache eviction tailored to pure diffusion architectures. This calls for a systematic study of dLLMs to revisit two essential problems: identifying which tokens are most crit- 1 arXiv:2510.09309v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Key Query (c) Attention map across heads (b) Cosine similarity across layers Sample Index Sample Index Layer Index Layer Index LLaDA Dream 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Query Key Key Information Head Structure Head Mask Tokens Decoded Tokens Prompt Tokens 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Key Query Step 0 Key Query Key Query Query (a) Attention map across steps Step 35 Step 70 Step 105 Figure 1: Visualization on attention maps and features in LLaDA.

Which tokens should be evicted? Due to the causal attention and the paradigm of \u201cnext-token- prediction, ARMs can not directly formulate the next multiple tokens. As a result, the cache eviction methods in ARMs usually rely only on past tokens (i.e., the prompt tokens and generated tokens). In contrast, dLLMs can access undecoded positions (i.e., the mask tokens), which may bring new possi- bilities. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), we find that the past tokens in dLLMs exhibit strong locality, primar- ily attending to themselves and nearby neighbors due to positional bias. In contrast, masked tokens maintain stable attention across denoising steps and consistently highlight a small set of pivotal prompt tokens, making the attention scores from the mask tokens a good metric for identifying the crucial tokens in the prompts during the entire decoding process. Based on this observation, we propose Mask-Voting to leverage the attention scores from mask tokens to identify pivotal prompt tokens and safely evict less important cache.

Based on this observation, we propose Mask-Voting to leverage the attention scores from mask tokens to identify pivotal prompt tokens and safely evict less important cache. How to allocate the cache budget? Existing ARM cache-budget schemes distribute per-layer and per- head capacity based on attention over past tokens (Wang et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024), but the pres- ence of masked tokens in dLLMs disrupts these patterns, demanding a new allocation strategy. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), dLLMs show clear layer-wise differences in importance: Features exhibit signifi- cant change after passing the first and last layers, while having very minimal change in the middle layers, indicating the first and last layers are in- dispensable while the middle layers tend to be re- dundant. At the head level, as shown in Fig. 1 (c), bidirectional attention yields specialized heads, as some perform prompt-based information extraction while others focus on masked-token structural plan- ning. To capture head-level reliance on prompts, we introduce a prompt-preference metric based on mask-query attention. Considering both im- portance and informativeness, we propose a two- stage budget allocation scheme that first assigns the KV cache budget across layers by importance and then refines the allocation across heads using the prompt-preference metric, avoiding allocation of KV to mask-dominated layers and heads. Based on the above observations, this paper introduces MaskKV as a KV eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, with the following contributions: 1. We analyze the attention behaviors of dLLMs and revealed several useful insights for KV cache eviction, showing how the mask tokens can participate in the judgment of important 2 KV and the allocation of KV budgets. 2. We introduce MaskKV, a KV cache eviction framework tailored to diffusion LLMs, which is composed of the mask-query guided token eviction, offline layer-wise budget allocation, and adaptive head-wise budget redistribution. 3. Extensive experiments on LongBench with LLaDA and Dream show that MaskKV sub- stantially reduces memory and computation overhead while preserving accuracy. Specif- ically, on LLaDA, it reaches 94% of the full- cache performance with the KV cache com- pressed to only 256 pairs. 2 Related Work 2.1 Diffusion Models for Language Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling non-autoregressive paradigm for text generation (Li et al., 2025b). Their core mechanism involves a progressive re- finement process, where a sequence is generated by iteratively denoising a noise-corrupted input over a series of discrete steps. Recent works have demonstrated both the scalability of this architec- ture (Nie et al., 2025) and the effectiveness of training techniques such as AR-based initialization and context-adaptive noise scheduling (Ye et al., 2025), achieving competitive performance. The development of diffusion LLMs is now driven by the twin objectives of accelerating in- ference and improving generation quality. To ac- celerate inference, Fast-dLLM (Wu et al., 2025) introduces a block-wise approximate KV cache tai- lored for dLLM, while dLLM-Cache (Liu et al., 2025b) leverages feature caching to reduce re- dundant computation.

SlowFast Sampling (Wei et al., 2025) jointly considers confidence, conver- gence and position for dynamic decoding, achiev- ing a practical trade-off between speed and qual- ity. For enhancing performance, DEADAL (Li et al., 2025a) addressed the limitation of fixed- length generation by introducing variable-length denoising. LongLLaDA (Liu et al., 2025a) extends diffusion LLMs to long contexts. These advance- ments have driven the demand for longer-context handling, which under caching mechanisms leads to prohibitive memory overhead. 2.2 KV Cache Compression The substantial memory footprint of the Key- Value (KV) cache presents a primary bottle- neck for long-context inference in Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs). Early approaches such as LongFormer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) used static, content-agnostic rules (e.g., sliding windows, atten- tion sinks), but their tendency to drop long-range information spurred interest in content-aware, dy- namic eviction policies (Zhang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Devoto et al., 2024). Prominent examples include H2O (Zhang et al., 2023), which greed- ily evicts KVs with low historical attention scores; SnapKV (Li et al., 2024), which filters for key KVs during the prefill phase. Building on the recogni- tion of specialized model components, recent stud- ies have explored finer-grained and adaptive budget allocation strategies (Cai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). At the layer level, methods either vary cache sizes across layers or dynamically reallocate budgets accord- ing to prompt-specific importance (Cai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). At the head level, approaches assign differentiated budgets or categorize heads into functional roles for selective caching (Feng et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). While effective for ARMs, these techniques depend on sequential decoding and are incompatible with the iterative inference of dLLMs. Existing attempts, such as Sparse-dLLM, provide only preliminary insights into sparse caching in dLLMs. We thus propose a more comprehensive and fine-grained framework for KV cache eviction for dLLMs. 3 Methodology 3.1 Preliminaries Inference of Diffusion Large Language Models. Diffusion language models (dLLMs) generate text through an iterative unmasking process over T dis- crete decoding steps, progressively refining a fully masked sequence into the final output. We first define the token vocabulary as T , which includes a special mask token [MASK] \u2208T . For a given prompt c = (c1, . . . , cM), the initial input state is x(T) = [c1, . . . , cM, [MASK], . . . , [MASK] | {z } L ] (1) where L is the pre-specified target response length. Unlike ARMs, which extend the sequence token by token, diffusion language models (dLLMs) re- 3 Cross-Modal Edge Fusion and Graph Assembly.

Tokens are evicted based on their importance under the given budget. fine the entire sequence in parallel at every step. This sequence includes the prompt, already de- coded tokens, and remaining [MASK] tokens. At each step t, the model f\u03d5 takes the current state x(t) and predicts a probability distribution over the vocabulary for every masked position, resulting in y = {yi | i \u2208M(t)}, the set of candidate tokens for all masked locations: P\u03d5(y | x(t)) = f\u03d5(x(t)) (2) and remasking policy R decides which tokens to decode and which to keep masked in the next step. x(t\u22121) = R \u0000x(t), P\u03d5(y | x(t)) \u0001 (3) The process continues until step t=0, at which point all [MASK] tokens have been replaced to yield the final sequence. This design enables parallel multi- token prediction but at the expense of substantial computational and memory costs. Caching in Diffusion Large Language Models Given the initial input x(T) composed of a prompt of length M and L masked positions, we denote the prompt and response token sets as P = {1 : M} and R = {M + 1 : M + L}, respectively. We index layers by \u2113= 1, . . . , D. At denoising step t, for layer \u2113and position i, we define the cacheable feature bundle Feat(t) \u2113(i) = {K(t) \u2113,i , V (t) \u2113,i , Attn(t) \u2113,i, FFN(t) \u2113,i} (4) and denote the cache entry by C(t) \u2113(i). And each layer forward pass computes: h(t) \u2113 = Attn\u2113 \u0000Q(t) \u2113, K(t) \u2113, V (t) \u2113 \u0001 + FFN\u2113 (5) Unlike autoregressive models, where causal atten- tion allows past KV states to be directly reused, dif- fusion LLMs employ bidirectional attention over both prompt and masked positions, which prevents the reuse of intermediate states. Because this oper- ation is repeated for every step and every token, it introduces substantial computational redundancy. Empirically, however,the feature bundles Feat(t) \u2113(i) exhibit strong similarity across adjacent steps, sug- gesting opportunities for caching (Liu et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025). At each step t, if i \u2208S(t), we refresh C(t) \u2113(i) = Feat(t) \u2113(i); otherwise, we reuse C(t\u22121) \u2113 (i). The def- inition of S(t) differs by token type. Prompt tokens.

For response tokens, we de- fine two candidate refresh sets: S(t) period = { i \u2208 R | t mod Tr = 0 } representing tokens refreshed periodically every Tr steps, and S(t) shift = { i \u2208 R | cos(V (t) \u2113,i , V (t\u22121) \u2113,i ) < \u03b4 } representing tokens whose feature vectors vary significantly between consecutive steps. The overall refresh set is given by S(t) R = S(t) period \u222aS(t) shift. 3.2 Observations Our hierarchical compression strategy stems from a top-down analysis of the dLLM\u2019s attention archi- tecture, which revealed optimization opportunities at the layer, head, and token levels. Layer-Level. Our analysis begins at the highest architectural level: the importance of each Trans- former layer. We quantify this importance by mea- suring each layer\u2019s representational transforma- tion, which we formalize as an importance score (see Section 3.3). Our analysis of these scores re- veals two critical phenomena, both visualized in 4 Fig. 1 (b): a distinct bimodal importance profile and strong cross-sample consistency. The bimodal profile is visually evident as the boundary layers (the first and last columns) consis- tently exhibit lighter colors than the middle lay- ers, signifying lower cosine similarity and thus higher importance. The cross-sample consistency is demonstrated by the vertical uniformity of this pattern across all samples, indicating that this im- portance hierarchy is remarkably stable. These two findings form the cornerstone of our allocation strategy. The bimodal profile dictates the need for a non-uniform, group-based allocation, while the cross-sample consistency validates the feasibility of a static, offline approach. Head-Level. Building on our layer-level find- ings, we next analyzed the behavior of individ- ual attention heads. Our analysis reveals a signifi- cant functional heterogeneity, as different heads ex- hibit widely varying degrees of dependency on the prompt context. The examples in Fig. 1 (c) clearly illustrate this. The head we term the Information Head is highly dependent on the prompt to perform long-range information retrieval. Conversely, the Structure Head shows a low dependency on the prompt, as its primary role is to plan the discourse structure by organizing the syntactic framework. This observed variation is the direct motivation for our next strategy: a fine-grained, head-wise bud- get allocation, weighted according to each head\u2019s reliance on the prompt context. Token-Level. Finally, after allocating budgets to layers and heads, a universal criterion is needed to select the specific tokens to retain. Our analysis of token-level attention patterns reveals this criterion. A crucial dichotomy emerges (see Fig. 1 (a)): non- mask tokens (i.e. the prompt and already-decoded tokens) exhibit a strong locality bias, serving to encode their own context. In stark contrast, at- tention from mask queries is highly sparse and long-range, functioning as a task-driven informa- tion retrieval mechanism.

In stark contrast, at- tention from mask queries is highly sparse and long-range, functioning as a task-driven informa- tion retrieval mechanism. Critically, this sparse attention is also remarkably consistent across all generation steps. This provides the final piece of our framework: the attention from mask queries serves as the definitive and stable signal for token importance, applicable to any head. 3.3 The MaskKV Framework Based on our empirical findings, we propose MaskKV, a framework that reframes KV cache pruning as a two-stage process: first, it establishes a universal importance ranking for all tokens, and second, it applies a hierarchical budget to this rank- ing to perform eviction. Stage 1: Universal Token Importance Ranking. We observe that, unlike prompt queries which exhibit local bias, mask queries perform sparse long-range retrieval with strong cross-step con- sistency, making them reliable indicators of to- ken importance. This aligns with our theoretical proof (Appendix A.3) that mask-guided attention provides the most direct signal for the generative task. Consequently, we propose Mask-Voting, a one-shot method that leverages the reliable, task- aligned signal from mask queries at the initial in- ference step. We first compute the attention score matrix A from all mask queries (Qmask) to all keys (Kfull): A = softmaxrow QmaskKT full \u221adk ! (6) From this matrix, we derive an importance score vector I \u2208Rnp for the prompt tokens by aggregat- ing the scores each key receives: Ij = nm X i=1 Aij for j \u2208{1, . . . , np} (7) The output of this stage is the vector I, which pro- vides a universal, budget-agnostic importance rank- ing of all prompt tokens. Stage 2: Hierarchical Budgeted Eviction. The second stage determines the fine-grained, per-head eviction budget kl,h using a top-down allocation policy. This process systematically distributes the total prompt budget, kp, across the model\u2019s layers and then its heads, guided by data-driven impor- tance metrics. At the layer level, we allocate the total budget kp based on layer importance. We quantify this importance using a score, I(l), that measures the representational transformation performed by each layer. A larger transformation signifies higher im- portance. Inspired by prior work (Wang et al., 2024; He et al., 2024), we define it as: I(l) = 1 \u22121 n n X i=1 cos_sim \u0010 h(l) in,i, h(l) out,i \u0011 (8) where h(l) in,i and h(l) out,i are the input and output hid- den states of the attention sub-layer for the i-th token. 5 With the layer importance score I(l) defined, we now detail our hybrid allocation strategy. The total budget kp is first partitioned into a uniform base component and an importance-driven component. The per-layer base budget, kbase, is set by a hyper- parameter \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1]: kbase = \u0016\u03b2 \u00b7 kp L \u0017 (9) kimp = kp \u2212L \u00b7 kbase (10) where kimp is the total remaining budget to be allo- cated based on importance. Next, we distribute kimp to the boundary (Sbound) and middle (Smid)", "kbase, is set by a hyper- parameter \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1]: kbase = \u0016\u03b2 \u00b7 kp L \u0017 (9) kimp = kp \u2212L \u00b7 kbase (10) where kimp is the total remaining budget to be allo- cated based on importance. Next, we distribute kimp to the boundary (Sbound) and middle (Smid) layer groups, proportional to their aggregated importance scores (Ig = P l\u2208Sg I(l)). This yields the total group budgets, denoted kgroup,B and kgroup,M: kgroup,B = kimp \u00b7 IB IB + IM (11) kgroup,M = kimp \u2212kgroup,B (12) Finally, the budget for any given layer, kl, is the sum of its base budget and an equal share of its group\u2019s importance-driven budget: kl = kbase + \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u0016kgroup,B |Sbound| \u0017 if l \u2208Sbound \u0016kgroup,M |Smid| \u0017 if l \u2208Smid (13) An \u201conline\u201d implementation of this algorithm is fundamentally flawed for reducing peak mem- ory. Budget allocation requires scores from all lay- ers, which necessitates a full forward pass with the entire, uncompressed KV cache stored. Eviction could only occur after the peak memory has already been reached. Therefore, leveraging our finding of cross-sample consistency, we adopt an offline paradigm. By pre-computing a importance profile on a calibration set, we can determine all budgets a priori, enabling immediate layer-by-layer eviction that effectively reduces the peak memory footprint. At the head level, the per-layer budget kl is dis- tributed among its Nh heads. This allocation is guided by each head\u2019s Prompt Preference, P (l) h , which quantifies its dependency on the prompt: P (l) h = S(l,h) m\u2192p S(l,h) m\u2192p + S(l,h) m\u2192m (14) where S(l,h) m\u2192p and S(l,h) m\u2192m are the sums of mask-to- prompt and mask-to-mask attention, respectively. The final, fine-grained budget for each head, kl,h, is calculated via a hybrid strategy controlled by a hyperparameter \u03b1 \u2208[0, 1]. This strategy combines a fixed base allocation with a proportional alloca- tion based on preference into a single formula: kl,h = j \u03b1 \u00b7 kl + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u00b7 Nh \u00b7 kl \u00b7 \u02c6P (l) h k (15) where \u02c6P (l) h = P (l) h / PNh j=1 P (l) j is the normalized Prompt Preference score. Finally, with the universal importance ranking I from Stage 1 and the specific per-head budget kl,h from Stage 2, the eviction is performed by selecting the top-k tokens: Skeep = arg topk(I, kl,h) (16) 4 Experiment 4.1 Experiment Settings Implementation Details.

These base rates first guarantee each unit a minimal share, after which the remaining budget is redistributed according to estimated im- portance. Excessively large values drive allocations toward near-uniformity, diluting capacity for crit- ical modules, whereas overly small values make the policy too aggressive and unstable. Empiri- cal results (Fig. 5) show that setting \u03b1 = 0.1 and \u03b2 = 0.4 provides the most stable accuracy and key-value (KV) budgets, while still concentrating resources where they matter most. Mask-Token Voting and Budget Allocation. Our Mask-Voting consistently achieves superior perfor- mance over other token selection methods by di- rectly leveraging mask queries, which helps avoid local bias and better identify influential tokens. More comprehensive comparisons with alternative token selection strategies are provided in Tab. 7. In addition, our budget allocation strategies Boundary- Aware at the layer level and Prompt-Preference at the head level both outperform competing ap- proaches in Tab. 2.

To better understand the model\u2019s ability to retrieve fine-grained information hidden within long contexts, we conduct a prelimi- nary study using the \u201cneedle-in-a-haystack\u201d setup (see Fig. 6). Our method shows stronger robustness to increasing prompt length, effectively maintain- ing information retrieval performance. Visualization of Prompt Preference. As shown in Fig. 7, we analyze the prompt pref- erence distribution across different heads within the same layer. Some heads allocate substantial atten- tion to the prompt, likely to extract task-relevant in- formation, while others focus more on the masked region to plan answer generation. Such analysis provides deeper insight into their internal decision behavior. 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.7 1.0 Sample 3 Head Index Layer Index Sample 2 Head Index Layer Index Sample 1 Head Index Layer Index Figure 7: Visualization of Prompt Preference. Comparison of Voting Strategies. We analyze voting strategies by grouping masked tokens into front, middle, and back regions, each contributing a position-specific vote. Results (Tab. 8) show that later positions yield more accurate votes for iden- tifying critical tokens, suggesting position-aware voting may further improve eviction effectiveness. 8 6 Conclusion We explored dLLM characteristics and intro- duced MaskKV, a training-free framework enabling fine-grained cache eviction via Mask Voting and adaptive layer\u2013head budget allocation. Experi- ments show that MaskKV reduces the KV cache to 256 tokens while retaining up to 94% of original performance, highlighting an efficient trade-off for long-context inference. 7 Limitations Our current experiments are limited to 7B/8B-scale dLLMs, constrained by the limited availability of open-source models. The effectiveness of our pro- posed methods and the observed attention behavior patterns have yet to be validated on both larger- scale and smaller lightweight models. Moreover, our evaluation is confined to text generation bench- marks, and extending the analysis to multimodal reasoning remains an important direction for future research.

In dLLM-Cache, fea- tures from both the prompt and response tokens (including keys, values, attention outputs, and MLP activations) are cached at each denoising step. However, we observe that only the key\u2013value representations of prompt tokens contribute to the attention computation of mask tokens, while the prompt-side attention and MLP outputs have no downstream influence. We therefore exclude these redundant prompt features from caching and retain only their key\u2013value pairs, which substantially re- duces memory usage without affecting generation quality. Mask-only Projection. In the official LLaDA im- plementation, after the final layer computation, the model projects all tokens (including both prompt and mask positions) into the vocabulary space to produce logits. This operation yields a large but un- necessary tensor, as the logits of prompt tokens are never used during decoding. We thus restrict the vocabulary projection to masked positions only and skip the prompt ones. This mask-only projection optimization removes redundant matrix multiplica- tions and further reduces GPU memory consump- tion. A.2 Implementation Details Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate both the effi- ciency and quality of our method using quantitative metrics. Generation quality is assessed with the of- ficial task-specific metrics (see Table 6 for details) of LongBench, which measure model accuracy un- der cache eviction. Computation efficiency is re- ported in Tokens Per Second (TPS), reflecting the average number of tokens decoded per second. For memory efficiency, we track both", "Generation quality is assessed with the of- ficial task-specific metrics (see Table 6 for details) of LongBench, which measure model accuracy un- der cache eviction. Computation efficiency is re- ported in Tokens Per Second (TPS), reflecting the average number of tokens decoded per second. For memory efficiency, we track both the peak GPU memory during inference and the size of the KV cache. Under bf16 precision, the KV cache mem- ory footprint is given by MemKV = 2 \u00b7 L \u00b7 H \u00b7 dhead \u00b7 sbf16, (17) where L is the sequence length, H the number of attention heads, dhead the dimension per head, and sbf16 = 2 bytes denotes the storage size of a bf16 element. The factor 2 represents the storage requirements for both key and value states. Baseline. We compare one token-selection scheme and three architectural budget-allocation policies under an identical cache budget, enabling a fair, apples-to-apples assessment of their effec- tiveness. For the token selection strategy, we evaluate one strong KV-cache compression method as a baseline for autoregressive models. \u2022 SnapKV uses a small \u201cobservation window\u201d at the end of the prompt to predict which parts of the entire context are most important. It an- alyzes the attention scores from this window in \u201cvoting\u201d mechanism to identify and select these key parts. For architectural budget allocation, we evaluate competitive approaches that distribute the budget across the model\u2019s various structural components. \u2022 PyramidKV implements a static, non- uniform budget allocation where the cache capacity of each layer is a direct function of its depth. This function is engineered to be mono- tonically decreasing, granting the maximal budget to the lowest layers and progressively constricting it for higher layers that process more semantically aggregated representations. 11 Full Attention MaskKV(Ours) SnapKV PyramidKV SqueezeAttention AdaKV LLaDA-8B-Instruct Budget = 256 Dream-v0-Instruct-7B Budget = 256 Full Attention MaskKV(Ours) SnapKV PyramidKV SqueezeAttention AdaKV Figure 8: Performance comparison of different KV Cache compression techniques on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B models in the \u201cNeedle-in-a-Haystack\u201d test (Budget B=256). The heatmaps show retrieval accuracy at different context lengths (x-axis) and depths (y-axis), where greener colors indicate better performance. \u2022 SqueezeAttention gauges layer importance by calculating the cosine similarity between the input and output of an attention block. Based on this score, it classifies layers into three tiers and assigns a minimal cache bud- get to the least important one. \u2022 Ada-KV allocates its cache budget in a fine- grained, adaptive manner: it first assesses the relative importance of each key\u2013value (KV) pair across all attention heads, then distributes the budget proportionally, granting a larger share of resources to KVs belonging to the most salient heads. Parameters. Our experimental parameters are configured in accordance with prior research(Li et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024). The specific settings are as follows: \u2022 Default Selection Method: Unless otherwise specified, we adopt SnapKV as the founda- tional selection method for all budget alloca- tion strategies. For SnapKV (Li et al., 2024) itself, the final window size is set to 32, con- sistent with its application in", "2024). The specific settings are as follows: \u2022 Default Selection Method: Unless otherwise specified, we adopt SnapKV as the founda- tional selection method for all budget alloca- tion strategies. For SnapKV (Li et al., 2024) itself, the final window size is set to 32, con- sistent with its application in the LongBench benchmark. \u2022 Pyramid-based Allocation: We set the hy- perparameter \u03b2, which directly controls the \u201csteepness\u201d of the allocation pyramid, to 20, adhering to the default value proposed in the original paper (Cai et al., 2024). \u2022 SqueezeAttention: We cluster the layers into three distinct groups. A 40% budget is allo- cated to the least important group, a setting identified as optimal in its original study. \u2022 AdaKV(Feng et al., 2024): We reserve a 20% budget for uniform allocation. This measure is implemented to prevent the assignment of excessively small budgets to highly sparse at- tention heads. Experiment settings. To ensure reproducibility, we outline our experimental settings. Unless oth- erwise specified, our default configuration sets the prompt refresh interval to 50, the response refresh interval to 5, the transfer ratio to 0.25, and the block length to 8. The step size is set equal to the gen- eration length, which is specified for each task in Table 6. For the results presented in Fig. 3 and the ablation study in Tab. 2, the KV cache budget is set to 256. The experiment in Fig. 5 is conducted on the HotpotQA dataset with a budget of 32. For the NIAH baseline, we adopt the same configuration as that used in DuoAttention (Xiao et al., 2024). Datasets. We conducted evaluations using Long- Bench (Bai et al., 2023). The LongBench bench- mark (Bai et al., 2023) evaluates large language models across a diverse set of long-context tasks. The benchmark is structured into six key domains: \u2022 Single-Document QA: Assesses a model\u2019s ability to extract answers from a single source document. This category utilizes datasets such as NarrativeQA (Ko\u02c7cisk`y et al., 2018), Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021), and Multi- FieldQA (Bai et al., 2023), covering docu- ments ranging from academic papers and legal files to encyclopedias. \u2022 Multi-Document QA: Challenges models to synthesize information from multiple docu- ments to formulate a coherent answer.

The output of layer l is the sum of its input and an update term \u2206(l): h(l) = h(l\u22121) + \u2206(l) Table 7: Comparison of token selection strategies on gsm8k with budget=128.

A.3.2 Proposition For any mask token m \u2208Sm, its final hidden state h(L) m , which directly determines the predictive log- its, can be precisely expressed as the sum of its initial embedding h(0) m and the cumulative updates from all L layers of the model. Within these up- dates, the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mecha- nism serves as the sole channel for the mask token to incorporate information from the prompt tokens. Consequently, the attention scores originating from mask queries are the most direct and fundamental indicators of the importance of prompt information for the model\u2019s generative process. A.3.3 Proof The proof proceeds in three steps. First, we es- tablish the central role of h(L) m by considering the 15 Table 8: Effect of mask token position on voting performance (budget=256).

Second, we derive the compositional structure of h(L) m through a recursive expansion. Finally, we analyze the components of this structure to demonstrate the unique role of the attention mechanism. Step 1: The Inference Objective and Decisive Computations During inference, the objective of the model is to predict a sequence of tokens for the positions specified by the mask index set, Sm. This generative process begins with the computation of the final hidden states, h(L) \u2208Rn\u00d7d, for the entire sequence. The language model head (LM Head), a linear projection matrix Wout \u2208Rd\u00d7|V | (where |V | is the vocabulary size), then maps these hidden states to logit vectors: Logits = h(L) \u00b7 Wout A \u201csoftmax\u201d function is subsequently applied to the logits at each position to yield a probability distribution over the vocabulary. Critically, for the task at hand, our interest lies exclusively in the logits at the active mask posi- tions (Sm), since all other tokens\u2014whether part of the original prompt (Sp) or already unmasked in prior steps\u2014are considered fixed context. There- fore, the generative process, whether it be greedy decoding or sampling, is performed exclusively on the probability distributions corresponding to the mask positions. This implies that the quantities of interest, which solely determine the generated out- put, are the final hidden states of the mask tokens, {h(L) m | m \u2208Sm}. Step 2: Recursive Expansion of the Hidden State Based on the abstract update rule h(l) = h(l\u22121) + \u2206(l), we can perform a recursive expan- sion (a telescoping sum) for the final hidden state h(L) m of any mask token m: h(L) m = h(L\u22121) m + \u2206(L) m = (h(L\u22122) m + \u2206(L\u22121) m ) + \u2206(L) m = h(L\u22122) m + \u2206(L\u22121) m + \u2206(L) m ... = h(0) m + L X l=1 \u2206(l) m This expansion is the mathematical centerpiece of our proof, showing that the final representation is an accumulation of updates upon its initial state. Step 3: Analysis of the Update Components We now analyze the composition of the cumula- tive update term PL l=1 \u2206(l) m . Each layer\u2019s update \u2206(l) m consists of contributions from the MHA and FFN sub-layers: \u2206(l) m = MHA(l) m + FFN(l) m . \u2022 Contribution of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN): The FFN is a position-wise transfor- mation. Its computation for token m is inde- pendent of all other tokens j \u0338= m. Thus, the FFN can only process and non-linearly trans- form the information already present in hm; it cannot introduce new information from the prompt. \u2022 Contribution of Multi-Head Attention (MHA): The MHA mechanism is fundamen- tally different. The output for token m, AttnOutm, is a weighted sum of the Value vectors Vj of all tokens in the sequence: AttnOutm = n X j=1 \u03b1mjVj where the attention weight \u03b1mj = softmax \u0012 QmKT j \u221adk \u0013 . The summation in- dex j spans all tokens,", "tally different. The output for token m, AttnOutm, is a weighted sum of the Value vectors Vj of all tokens in the sequence: AttnOutm = n X j=1 \u03b1mjVj where the attention weight \u03b1mj = softmax \u0012 QmKT j \u221adk \u0013 . The summation in- dex j spans all tokens, including those in the prompt (j \u2208Sp). This demonstrates 16 that MHA is the exclusive mechanism that allows for information exchange between different token positions. For a mask token m \u2208Sm, only through MHA can it interact with prompt tokens j \u2208Sp to aggregate relevant information. Combining these points, we see that within the fi- nal representation h(L) m = h(0) m + PL l=1(MHA(l) m + FFN(l) m ), the MHA term is the sole channel through which information from the prompt can be incorpo- rated into the mask token\u2019s representation. A.3.4 Conclusion and Implication In conclusion, our theoretical proof establishes the primacy of attention guided by mask queries within the generative paradigm of dLLMs. By demonstrat- ing that this mechanism is the indispensable infor- mation bridge from context to target, our findings provide a robust theoretical foundation for novel inference strategies, such as the KV cache selection method proposed in this work. 17", "Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph Zheng Zhao1,2,\u2217, Yeskendir Koishekenov1, Xianjun Yang1, Naila Murray1, Nicola Cancedda1 1FAIR at Meta, 2University of Edinburgh \u2217Work done during an internship at FAIR Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black- box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model\u2019s latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods.

(2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model\u2019s faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model\u2019s computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning. Date: October 13, 2025 Correspondence: zheng.zhao@ed.ac.uk; ncan@meta.com 1 Introduction Chain-of-Thought (CoT; Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022) prompting has proven to be a powerful method for boosting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability is now central to the latest generation of reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) and OpenAI\u2019s o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024). Despite this success, a fundamental vulnerability persists across the spectrum of these systems: the reasoning process itself is sometimes flawed (Turpin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025b; Arcuschin et al., 2025; Lindsey et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b). This reliability gap has spurred research into automated verification. Current methods fall into two main categories. Black-box approaches analyze the generated text or final logit distribution (Jacovi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025b; Baker et al., 2025). Gray-box approaches look at the model\u2019s internal state, using simple probes on raw activations or analyzing the trajectory of hidden states (Xie et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Afzal et al., 2025; Bi et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a). While insightful, these methods are fundamentally limited; they can detect that a model\u2019s internal state is correlated with an error, but not explain why the underlying computation leads to an error. This limitation motivates a deeper, more mechanistic approach. We postulate that models implement latent algorithms that solve specific tasks through specialized subgraphs, or circuits (Olah et al., 2020; Elhage et al., 2021). From this perspective, a reasoning failure is not merely an erroneous state, but a flaw in the execution of a latent algorithm. To diagnose such flaws requires inspecting the underlying computational process, akin to examining an execution trace in classical software. We propose to approximate", "2020; Elhage et al., 2021). From this perspective, a reasoning failure is not merely an erroneous state, but a flaw in the execution of a latent algorithm. To diagnose such flaws requires inspecting the underlying computational process, akin to examining an execution trace in classical software. We propose to approximate this trace by constructing an attribution graph (Dunefsky et al., 2025)\u2014a structural representation of the causal information flow between model components. For such a graph to serve as a meaningful trace, its components must be interpretable. We therefore first create an interpretable surrogate model by replacing its standard MLP modules with trained transcoders (Dunefsky et al., 2025). We then construct and analyze attribution graphs over the sparsely activating features of such surrogate model (Ameisen et al., 2025). Finally, to formally test whether these traces contain a detectable signal of error, we train a diagnostic classifier on their structural properties. This entire methodology, which we call Circuit-based Reasoning Verification 1 arXiv:2510.09312v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 (CRV), is thus designed as a scientific instrument to investigate our central hypothesis: that reasoning failures manifest as detectable structural signatures on their computational execution traces, which can be leveraged for automated verification. As a scientific instrument, CRV requires a controlled experimental setting. While advanced reasoning models employ complex mechanisms like search and backtracking, their convoluted reasoning paths can obscure the fundamental computations of a single reasoning step. Our work therefore focuses on standard, instruction-tuned models generating autoregressive CoT, as this paradigm provides a clearer window into the primitive computations that underpin emergent reasoning. While our approach, despite being effective, is too computationally intensive to be intended as a practical, drop-in verifier, it yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. Our main contributions are therefore not just about performance, but about understanding: \u2022 We introduce Circuit-based Reasoning Verification, a white-box method for analyzing reasoning failures, showing that verifying reasoning via its computational graph is feasible. \u2022 We find that the structural signatures of error are highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in executing different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. \u2022 We establish the causal role of these error signatures, successfully correcting faulty reasoning via targeted interventions on individual transcoder features. \u2022 To support future research, we will release datasets with step-level correctness labels for CoT reasoning on synthetic and real-world tasks, along with our trained transcoders. 2 Problem Formulation and Preliminaries 2.1 Problem Statement Let an LLM generate a Chain-of-Thought S = (s1, s2, . . . , sm) to solve a problem, where each step si is a sequence of tokens. During the generation of step si, the underlying model produces a computational state Mi. From this state, we construct an attribution graph Gi = (V, E), where vertices V represent interpretable features and tokens, and edges E represent the causal influence between them (see Section 3.2). From each graph Gi, we extract a fixed-size feature vector xi = \u03d5(Gi), where \u03d5 is a feature extraction function designed to capture the graph\u2019s structural properties. We term this vector the step\u2019s structural fingerprint. Our goal is", "and edges E represent the causal influence between them (see Section 3.2). From each graph Gi, we extract a fixed-size feature vector xi = \u03d5(Gi), where \u03d5 is a feature extraction function designed to capture the graph\u2019s structural properties. We term this vector the step\u2019s structural fingerprint. Our goal is to learn a diagnostic classifier f\u03b8 that takes this structural fingerprint as input to predict the correctness of the reasoning step: \u02c6yi = f\u03b8(xi) where \u02c6yi \u2208{correct, incorrect}. 2.2 Preliminaries: Circuits in Transformers The term \u201ccircuit\u201d in mechanistic interpretability refers to a specific subgraph within a neural network that implements a human-understandable algorithm (Olah et al., 2020). In Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), these circuits are composed of attention heads and MLP computations. Our work is conceptually motivated by the prospect of finding patterns distinguishing sound and faulty activations of circuits involved in reasoning. While our method does not observe these circuits directly, our hypothesis is that they cast detectable structural fingerprints onto the attribution graphs we construct. A primary goal of our subsequent analysis is therefore to interpret the graph-based features that are most predictive of failure as the signatures of these underlying error patterns. 2.3 Preliminaries: Transcoders for Interpretable Features A significant challenge in analyzing model activations is their high dimensionality and lack of direct interpretability. A powerful approach to this challenge is to learn a sparse, overcomplete basis for these activations using a sparse autoencoder (SAE; Cunningham et al., 2023). An SAE is trained to reconstruct an activation vector x \u2208Rd from a much higher-dimensional, but mostly zero, feature vector f \u2208RD, where D \u226bd. The elements of f correspond to a set of learned, interpretable features, sparsely activated by inputs. While the canonical SAE objective is to reconstruct its own input (f(x) \u2248x), our work leverages a variant known as a transcoder (Dunefsky et al., 2025), which is instead trained 2 MLP MLP MLP PLT PLT PLT Residual Stream Neuron Transcoder Feature 8 3 + 5 = Embeddings Layer 1 Layer 1 Layer 2 Layer 2 Layer 3 Layer 3 Output ... ... 1) Replace MLP Modules with Transcoders 2) Construct Attribution Graphs 3) Extract Graph Features Global Stats Node Stats Topological Features 4) Diagnostic Classifier Correct Incorrect Figure 1 The CRV pipeline.

This approach makes the transcoder a true functional substitute for the original module. Its objective is not mere reconstruction, but the emulation of a computational step in an interpretable, sparsely activated basis. By replacing a model\u2019s standard MLP module with a trained transcoder, we force its intermediate computations to be represented not by a dense vector, but by a sparse combination of these meaningful features. 3", "not mere reconstruction, but the emulation of a computational step in an interpretable, sparsely activated basis. By replacing a model\u2019s standard MLP module with a trained transcoder, we force its intermediate computations to be represented not by a dense vector, but by a sparse combination of these meaningful features. 3 Methodology Unlike in Process Reward Modeling (PRM), where the goal is limited to judging the correctness of a reasoning step, we take the perspective of a model developer interested in debugging reasoning failures in a specific model to which they have full access. We introduce Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV), a method for detecting flawed reasoning by analyzing its structural fingerprint. 3.1 Dataset Curation and Step-Level Annotation A prerequisite for developing our method is a dataset with reliable step-level correctness labels. Furthermore, our white-box methodology imposes a critical requirement that distinguishes our data needs from prior work. Since CRV analyzes the causal computational graph that produces a reasoning step, we must capture the full internal state of our specific model during the generation process. Consequently, existing text-only datasets such as PRM800K (Lightman et al., 2024) and REVEAL (Jacovi et al., 2024), which provide static \u2018(text, label)\u2019 pairs and are designed for training black-box verifiers, are incompatible with our mechanistic approach. We must generate and label our own model\u2019s CoT outputs to create the necessary \u2018(text, label, computational trace)\u2019 tuples for analysis. We therefore created a new benchmark covering both controlled synthetic tasks and the real-world GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021). Synthetic Datasets (Boolean and Arithmetic). To study reasoning failures in a controlled environment, we generated two datasets. The first involves evaluating complex boolean expressions, while the second involves multi-step arithmetic problems. The motivation for these datasets is the unambiguous ground truth: the correctness of any step in the reasoning chain (e.g., \u201c15 + 7 = 22\u201d) can be verified automatically by a simple parser and evaluator. This allows us to generate a large, labeled dataset for initial training and analysis. Furthermore, these tasks are intrinsically compositional, and the complexity of samples can be fully controlled. Further details are provided in Appendix A. Step-Level Annotation for GSM8K. Annotating a real-world dataset like GSM8K is challenging. To scale, we used a semi-automated process with a stronger LLM (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B Instruct) as an expert judge. For each CoT, the 3 judge evaluated step correctness given the full problem context. We validated these labels through manual review of a substantial subset, yielding a high-fidelity dataset for real-world reasoning. Further details are provided in Appendix A. 3.2 Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV) CRV is a four-stage pipeline designed to classify the correctness of a CoT step by analyzing the computational graph of a modified, interpretable LLM. An overview is presented in Figure 1. 3.2.1 Step 1: Replacing MLPs with Interpretable Transcoders The foundation of CRV is an architectural modification that makes the target LLM interpretable. For each MLP module in the model, we train a corresponding transcoder on a large, diverse dataset of activations harvested from the original LLM.1 The training objective combines an L2 reconstruction", "Replacing MLPs with Interpretable Transcoders The foundation of CRV is an architectural modification that makes the target LLM interpretable. For each MLP module in the model, we train a corresponding transcoder on a large, diverse dataset of activations harvested from the original LLM.1 The training objective combines an L2 reconstruction loss with a TopK activation function, which enforces sparsity by preserving only the k-largest feature activations. Once trained, we replace the MLP module for each layer in the LLM with its corresponding transcoder. The forward pass of the model is now forced to flow through these sparse, interpretable bottlenecks. All subsequent analysis is performed on this modified, interpretable replacement model. Full details of the transcoder architecture and training are provided in Appendix B. 3.2.2 Step 2: Constructing Step-Level Attribution Graphs With our transcoder-infused replacement model, we require a principled method to trace information flow and construct a causal graph of the computation. To this end, we adapt the recent circuit analysis methodology of Dunefsky et al. (2025). Applying their greedy path-finding algorithm allows us to trace high-attribution connections backward from the final logits, yielding a sparse, weighted, directed graph Gi = (V, E) for each reasoning step si. This graph represents the core computational subgraph, where the nodes V are the disjoint union of input tokens, active transcoder features, and output logits. The directed edges E represent the high-attribution causal pathways between these components (e.g., from an early-layer feature to a later-layer feature, or from a feature to a logit), with weights quantifying the strength of their influence. For a complete derivation and description of the circuit-finding algorithm, we refer the reader to the original work (Dunefsky et al., 2025).2 3.2.3 Step 3: Extracting Interpretable Graph Features From each attribution graph Gi, we extract a fixed-size feature vector xi as a structural fingerprint of the computation. We prune the graph to its most influential components, retaining nodes and edges accounting for a threshold (e.g., 80%) of total influence to the final logits. The feature set, calculated on this pruned subgraph (unless stated otherwise), is organized into three hierarchical levels. Global Graph Statistics: These features capture a high-level summary of the computational subgraph, including the count of active feature nodes after pruning and the final logit probability and entropy. They provide a coarse measure of the computation\u2019s complexity and uncertainty. Node Influence and Activation Statistics: This group quantifies the properties of the interpretable feature nodes. We compute statistics (mean, max, std) on their activation values and influence scores. This helps distinguish computations driven by a few highly active, decisive features from those driven by a diffuse combination of many weak features. We also include a histogram of active features by layer, which characterizes the computational depth of the reasoning step. Topological and Path-Based Features: To analyze the structure of the information flow, we compute a rich set of topological features on the pruned subgraph. These include graph density, centrality measures (degree, betweenness) to identify computational hubs, and connectivity metrics. This comprehensive feature set provides the foundation for our diagnostic classifier. A full list", "Features: To analyze the structure of the information flow, we compute a rich set of topological features on the pruned subgraph. These include graph density, centrality measures (degree, betweenness) to identify computational hubs, and connectivity metrics. This comprehensive feature set provides the foundation for our diagnostic classifier. A full list and detailed motivation for each feature is provided in Appendix C.1. 1This is also referred as per-layer transcoders (PLTs) by Ameisen et al. (2025). 2We use implementation from Hanna et al. (2025) for computing attribution graphs in our work. 4 3.2.4 Step 4: Diagnostic Classifier For the final classification step, we use a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) trained on the extracted feature vectors: f\u03b8(xi) = \u02c6yi. GBC suits for our heterogeneous, tabular features and provides robust feature importance measures, which we leverage to identify the most predictive structural properties of error circuits. We also benchmark against several alternative classifiers in Appendix C.3. 4 Experiments We conduct a series of experiments designed to validate the central hypothesis of our work: that the attribution graphs of reasoning steps contain a rich, structural signal of their correctness. Our evaluation is structured around three primary research questions. First, we investigate whether CRV\u2019s white-box approach significantly outperforms a comprehensive suite of gray-box and black-box baselines in verification accuracy and test its robustness to domain shifts and increasing task difficulty (RQ1). Next, we analyze our trained models to identify which specific computational structures within the graph are most predictive of failure, moving from detection to mechanistic understanding (RQ2). Finally, we conduct exploratory studies to assess if these mechanistic insights can be used to perform targeted, causal interventions that correct faulty reasoning (RQ3). 4.1 Experimental Setup Models and Datasets. Our experiments are conducted on the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model (AI@Meta, 2024). We select the instruction-tuned variant, as its prompt-following optimization is critical for reliably eliciting the CoT reasoning traces for our analysis. This model is then modified with our trained transcoders as described in Section 3. We evaluate performance on our three datasets: Synthetic (Boolean), Synthetic (Arithmetic), and the annotated GSM8K benchmark. Baselines. We compare CRV against two categories of baselines. First, black-box methods that use the final logit distribution: Maximum Softmax Probability (MaxProb), Perplexity (PPL), Entropy, Temperature Scaling (Temp. Scaling; Shih et al., 2023), and Energy (Liu et al., 2020). Second, gray-box methods that operate on internal states. This includes trajectory-based methods that analyze hidden state dynamics across layers, such as Chain-of-Embedding (with its real-space CoE-R and complex-space CoE-C variants; Wang et al., 2025a) and CoT-Kinetics (Bi et al., 2025), as well as a standard logistic regression probe (LR Probe) trained on the step\u2019s average hidden state.3 While CoE and CoT-Kinetics were originally designed for full CoT evaluation, they prove to be strong step-level baselines. All implementation details are deferred to Appendix C.2. Evaluation Metrics. We use AUROC, FPR@95, and AUPR to evaluate verifier performance. As our goal is the detection of reasoning failures, we treat the incorrect label as the positive class for all metric calculations. AUROC assesses how well the method ranks correct versus incorrect", "details are deferred to Appendix C.2. Evaluation Metrics. We use AUROC, FPR@95, and AUPR to evaluate verifier performance. As our goal is the detection of reasoning failures, we treat the incorrect label as the positive class for all metric calculations. AUROC assesses how well the method ranks correct versus incorrect steps across thresholds. AUPR captures the precision-recall trade-off for the positive (incorrect) class. FPR@95 measures the false positive rate when 95% of positives are correctly identified, reflecting reliability under strict conditions; a lower score indicates the verifier can detect most errors with minimal false alarm. Together, these metrics provide complementary views of performance. 4.2 Verification Performance and Robustness (RQ1) We first address RQ1 by evaluating CRV against all baselines on the task of reasoning step verification and then probing its robustness under more challenging conditions. Main Verification Performance. The results, presented in Table 1, provide strong empirical support for our central hypothesis: that the structural signatures present in a reasoning step\u2019s computational trace contain a directly verifiable signal of its correctness. CRV consistently outperforms all black-box and gray-box baselines across every dataset and metric. The strength of this structural signal is particularly evident on the synthetic datasets. On the Arithmetic task, for instance, CRV achieves an AUROC of 92.47, a significant leap over the strongest baseline score of 76.45. This advantage in reliability is further underscored by the FPR@95, where CRV reduces the false positive rate to 37.09% 3We also evaluated a last-token probe, but found that using the average representation yielded slightly better performance. 5 Paradigm Method Synthetic (Boolean) Synthetic (Arithmetic) GSM8K AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 Black-Box MaxProb 58.81 0.34 95.20 61.87 1.81 84.98 54.91 7.99 91.86 PPL 57.37 0.29 91.02 60.19 1.68 85.52 55.46 8.12 90.69 Entropy 53.56 0.24 97.55 60.03 1.52 85.40 56.67 7.29 87.08 Temp.

The low AUPR on the Boolean dataset reflects extreme label imbalance, with the incorrect label only 0.2% (Appendix A.5). from the baseline\u2019s 63.33%. The performance gap is most pronounced on these structured, synthetic datasets. We hypothesize that the structured nature of algorithmic reasoning induces highly consistent execution traces for valid solutions. Consequently, the structural signatures of error manifest as more uniform deviations from this baseline, rendering them highly detectable.

For each test dataset, we compare the strongest baseline (based on AUROC) against CRV trained in-domain and out-of-domain. Analysis of Cross-Domain Generalization. A key difference between CRV and most baselines is that its diagnostic classifier requires training. A critical ques- tion, therefore, is whether CRV learns domain-specific correlations or more fundamental, generalizable sig- natures of flawed reasoning. To test this, we conduct a comprehensive cross-domain evaluation. We train a CRV classifier on each of our three datasets individually and evaluate its zero-shot performance on the other two unseen domains. Table 2 shows that CRV\u2019s learned error fingerprints are highly domain-specific. In cross-domain transfer, the performance of CRV drops substantially compared to in- domain and often falls below the strongest training-free baseline. For example, CRV trained on the arithmetic task achieves an AUROC of 57.04 on GSM8K, falling short of the Energy baseline\u2019s 62.55. This domain specificity reveals that errors in different reasoning tasks (e.g., formal logic, arithmetic calculation, natural language arithmetic) produce distinct structural patterns in the model\u2019s computational graph. While it limits current supervised verification, it highlights the rich signal captured by CRV. The performance gap confirms that domain-specific signatures are powerful, motivating future work on diverse training or domain adaptation to improve generalization of circuit-based verifiers. Performance Under Increasing Difficulty. To further probe CRV\u2019s robustness, we analyze its performance on the synthetic arithmetic dataset as a function of problem complexity, controlled by the number of operators (n \u2208{5, 7, 10}).4 Figure 2 plots the performance of CRV against key baselines across these difficulty levels. While most methods show stable AUROC and FPR@95, CRV maintains a consistent advantage across all difficulty levels. AUPR generally improves for all methods as difficulty rises because harder problems increase the proportion of incorrect examples (a condition to which AUPR is sensitive). Importantly, CRV\u2019s advantage persists despite these shifts, highlighting the robustness of its structural signals across task difficulty and class balance. 4We exclude n = 3 as the model\u2019s high accuracy yields too few incorrect examples for reliable evaluation. 6 n=5 n=7 n=10 Number of Operators 50 60 70 80 90 100 AUROC Score AUROC n=5 n=7 n=10 Number of Operators 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 AUPR Score AUPR n=5 n=7 n=10 Number of Operators 50 60 70 80 90 100 False Positive Rate (%) FPR@95 MaxProb PPL Entropy Temp.

CRV retains a clear advantage as complexity increases. 4.3 Mechanistic Analysis of Error Computations (RQ2) Having demonstrated CRV\u2019s predictive power, we now turn to its key advantage: interpretability. To address RQ2, we dissect our graph representation to identify structural \u201cfingerprints\u201d of error, from high-level feature ablation to fine-grained analysis of the most predictive structures.

Ablation of Feature Families. A leave-one-out abla- tion study on the Synthetic (Arithmetic) dataset reveals a clear hierarchy of feature importance, as summarized in Table 3. The Node Influence & Activation features are demonstrably the most critical; their removal causes the most performance degradation across all metrics, most notably increasing FPR@95 by over 12 points. The Global Graph Statistics also provide a substantial contribution. Interestingly, the Topological & Path- Based features appear least critical for this specific task, suggesting that the state of key local features is a more dominant signal than the holistic graph structure. Nevertheless, the full CRV model, which integrates all three signal types, is required to achieve optimal verification performance. Visualizing the Structural Signatures of Error. To provide qualitative evidence for our hypothesis, we visualize the \u201cstructural fingerprints\u201d learned by our classifier. Figure 4 shows distributions of five highly predictive features for correct versus incorrect GSM8K reasoning steps. Across diverse feature types, from graph topology (e.g., Graph Density) to node statistics (e.g., Total Active Features), distributions are clearly distinct. Similar patterns are observed on our synthetic datasets (see included in Appendix C.4), confirming that the graph representation captures separable structural differences between valid and flawed computations. Correct Incorrect (a) Boolean Correct Incorrect (b) Arithmetic Correct Incorrect (c) GSM8K Figure 3 Distributions of features after PCA for correct (blue) vs. incorrect (red) reasoning steps. While individual features are predic- tive, CRV\u2019s strength lies in their com- bination. To illustrate this, we project the full high-dimensional feature vec- tors into two dimensions via Princi- pal Component Analysis (PCA). Fig- ure 3 reveals that incorrect steps form a dense subset within the broader dis- tribution of correct steps. Crucially, correct steps also occupy a distinct region not shared by incorrect com- putations. This suggests many reasoning failures are computational \u201cnear misses\u201d, structurally similar to valid steps, which explains the overlap.

The visual separation is statistically significant for each feature shown (independent t-test, p < 0.001) and represents a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d). This provides quantitative evidence that attribution graphs contain a clear, separable structural signal of a computation\u2019s integrity. accessible only to correct reasoning. A complementary t-SNE visualization in Appendix C.4 shows the same structure, confirming that CRV succeeds by learning the complex boundary of this zone rather than separating two simple clusters. 4.4 From Diagnosis to Causal Intervention (RQ3) Finally, we conduct an exploratory study to test whether CRV\u2019s diagnostic insights can guide prescriptive interventions. A key advantage of our white-box approach is that failure-predictive graph features can be traced to specific components of the model\u2019s computation. We illustrate this with a case study on the arithmetic task, correcting an order-of-operations error. Given the expression (7*((5+9)+7)), the model incorrectly computed 7*14=98 in its second step (Table 4). CRV flagged this step as incorrect, and feature importance highlighted an unusually high activation of a late-layer transcoder feature. Tracing the signal back to the graph, we found a single highly active last-layer transcoder feature (ID 91814) strongly associated with multiplication. We hypothesized that this premature activation caused the error, and performed a direct intervention. We re-ran the generation up to the point of failure and used a forward hook to manually clamp the activation of this specific multiplication feature to zero. The effect was immediate: as shown in the right column of Table 4, with the premature multiply impulse suppressed, the model correctly generated the next step 14+7=21 and proceeded to the correct final answer. Before Intervention (Incorrect) After Intervention (Correct) Evaluate the arithmetic expression below. ( 7 * ( ( 5 + 9 ) + 7 ) ) To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): 1. Evaluate the expression inside the innermost parenthe- ses: 5 + 9 = 14 2. Multiply 7 by the result: 7 * 14 = 98 3. Add 7 to the result: 98 + 7 = 105 Therefore, the expression evaluates to 105. Evaluate the arithmetic expression below. ( 7 * ( ( 5 + 9 ) + 7", "ses: 5 + 9 = 14 2. Multiply 7 by the result: 7 * 14 = 98 3. Add 7 to the result: 98 + 7 = 105 Therefore, the expression evaluates to 105.

Table 4 Side-by-side comparison of a reasoning trace before and after causal intervention. The highlight indicates the point of divergence where suppressing a single multiplication transcoder feature corrects the model\u2019s computational path. While not a general-purpose solution, this proof-of-concept is a crucial step. Beyond suppressing faulty features, we also corrected an error by amplifying an under-active feature (Appendix C.4). The success of both interventions provides closed-loop evidence that CRV\u2019s structural signatures are causally implicated in errors, opening a promising direction for targeted model interventions. 8 5 Related Work CoT Prompting for Improved Reasoning. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting was introduced by Wei et al. (2022) to elicit more complex reasoning from LLMs through few-shot examples that demonstrate step-by-step problem solving. Subsequent work has expanded this idea in several directions. Kojima et al. (2022) showed that even a simple zero-shot instruction such as \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d can trigger coherent reasoning traces. While this reduces the need for handcrafted prompts, providing structured examples often remains beneficial. To scale this process, recent studies generate CoT exemplars synthetically (Zhang et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025a). Other work leverages test-time compute scaling to extend reasoning chains, enabling longer and more elaborate solutions (Snell et al., 2024). For comprehensive surveys of CoT techniques and their applications, see Chu et al. (2024) and Chen et al. (2025a). Verifying and Improving CoT Reasoning. The transparency of CoT has also made it a focal point for research into model interpretability and reliability. While some work assumes reasoning traces are to some extent faithful representations of the model\u2019s internal process (Wei Jie et al., 2024; Korbak et al., 2025), a significant body of evidence highlights their unreliability (Arcuschin et al., 2025; Bentham et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025b; Turpin et al., 2023). This has spurred a rich field of research dedicated to verifying and improving CoT traces. This research broadly investigates (i) the model\u2019s intrinsic ability to self-evaluate its reasoning steps (Zhang et al., 2025), (ii) how to measure the faithfulness of a reasoning chain to the final answer (Lanham et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2025; Tutek et al., 2025), and (iii) when reasoning steps are needed or useful (Bogdan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). A parallel line of work aims to improve reasoning chains through various forms of neuro-symbolic reasoning (Lyu et al., 2023), correction (Tyen et al., 2024), uncertainty calibration (Ji et", "Tutek et al., 2025), and (iii) when reasoning steps are needed or useful (Bogdan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). A parallel line of work aims to improve reasoning chains through various forms of neuro-symbolic reasoning (Lyu et al., 2023), correction (Tyen et al., 2024), uncertainty calibration (Ji et al., 2025), or by enforcing internal consistency (Xie et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a). A distinct approach involves training auxiliary models, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), to assess step-level correctness and guide post-training (Lightman et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2025). While all these methods aim to improve reasoning outcomes, they primarily operate on the textual or hidden state representations. We are not aware of previous attempts to verify reasoning by analyzing the structural properties of its underlying computational graph. Mechanistic Interpretability of CoT Reasoning. Our work is most directly situated within the field of mechanistic interpretability, which seeks to reverse-engineer the algorithms learned by neural networks, moving beyond the surface- level analysis of CoT traces (Wei Jie et al., 2024; Korbak et al., 2025; Baker et al., 2025). A central tenet of this field is that models develop specialized subgraphs, or circuits, to perform specific computations (Olah et al., 2020). Recent work has begun to apply this lens to reasoning, not just for interpretation, but also to improve performance by eliciting or steering behavioral circuits (Zhao et al., 2025; Ward et al., 2025). A particularly powerful and increasingly popular tool in this area is the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn to decompose a model\u2019s dense activation vectors into a sparse basis of interpretable features (Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2023). Our work builds directly on a variant, the transcoder (Dunefsky et al., 2025), which acts as a functional, interpretable substitute for an MLP module. While prior work has used transcoder-based attribution graphs to qualitatively analyze the faithfulness of CoT reasoning (Ameisen et al., 2025), our work is the first to operationalize this approach for automated verification. We move beyond visual inspection by systematically extracting quantitative, structural features from these graphs and demonstrating that they can be used to diagnose computational failures. 6 Conclusion In this work, we introduced CRV, a white-box methodology for studying the computational structure of reasoning failures. By treating attribution graphs as execution traces of latent circuits, we showed that correct and incorrect reasoning leave distinct structural fingerprints. CRV revealed that these error signatures not only enable accurate verification but are also domain-specific, with failures in different reasoning tasks manifesting as distinct patterns. Moreover, targeted interventions on transcoder features demonstrated that these signatures are causally implicated, allowing us to correct faulty reasoning. Together, these findings establish CRV as a proof-of-concept for mechanistic analysis, showing that shifting from opaque activations to interpretable computational structure enables a causal understanding of how and why LLMs fail to reason correctly. 9 Acknowledgment We are grateful to Edan Toledo and Karen Hambardzumyan for their constructive discussions and insightful feedback on this project.

A.1 Synthetic Dataset Construction To create a controlled environment for studying reasoning failures, we procedurally generated two synthetic datasets: Boolean and Arithmetic. For each, we first generated a ground-truth expression, then prompted our base model (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) to produce a Chain-of-Thought solution towards solving the expression. We provide the prompt template used to generate CoT in Table 5. Once the CoT is generated, we split them into steps using regular expression.

Placeholders for dynamic content are shown in italics. Expression Generation. The complexity of the expressions was controlled by the number of operators, n \u2208 {3, 5, 7, 10}. For the Arithmetic task, we generated expressions with single-digit integers and the operators {+, \u2212, \u00d7}. For the Boolean task, operands were simply {True, False}, and possible operators are {and, or, not}. We gener- ated 10,000 unique expressions for each difficulty level, with the exception of the Boolean task at n = 3, where the number of unique expressions is inherently limited. Table 6 shows examples from these datasets with their associated CoTs generated by Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model. A.2 Labeling Protocol Our primary goal was to create labels of the highest possible quality. For the synthetic datasets, we developed a rigorous two-pronged strategy that leverages both a powerful LLM judge and direct programmatic verification, keeping only the annotations where both methods agree. Method 1: LLM-as-a-Judge. Our first annotation method uses a powerful, external LLM\u2014Llama 3.3 70B Instruct\u2014 as an expert judge. For each reasoning step, the judge model was provided with the full problem context and the generated step, and was prompted to output a binary correctness label and a justification. This method was used for all three datasets including the GSM8K dataset. We provide the prompts used for the judge in Table 7 (Boolean), Table 8 (Arithmetic), and Table 9 (GSM8K). 14 Task Example Boolean (n = 5) Expression: (((True or True) and (True and True)) or (True and False)) Generated CoT: To evaluate the boolean expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): 1. Evaluate the expressions inside the innermost parentheses: * (True or True) = True * (True and True) = True 2. Now the expression becomes: * (True and True) or (True and False) 3. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses: * (True and True) = True * (True and False) = False 4. Now the expression becomes: * True or False 5. Evaluate the final expression: * True or False = True The final answer is True. Arithmetic (n = 7) Expression: ((((-3)+(-6))*(9*6))+(-4)) Generated CoT: To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of", "* (True and False) = False 4. Now the expression becomes: * True or False 5. Evaluate the final expression: * True or False = True The final answer is True. Arithmetic (n = 7) Expression: ((((-3)+(-6))*(9*6))+(-4)) Generated CoT: To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): 1. Evaluate the expressions inside the innermost parentheses: * (-3) + (-6) = -9 2. Multiply 9 and 6: * 9 * 6 = 54 3. Multiply -9 and 54: * -9 * 54 = -486 4. Add -4 to -486: * -486 + (-4) = -490 The final answer is -490. Table 6 Examples of generated expressions and the corresponding CoT generated by our base model for the synthetic datasets. Method 2: Programmatic State Verification (Synthetic Datasets only). For the synthetic tasks, we developed a programmatic method to verify the logical integrity of the entire reasoning trace. This goes beyond simply checking the correctness of a single calculation. After each reasoning step i generated by the model, we use a specially crafted prompt to ask the model to output the current, simplified state of the original expression. For example, if the original expression is (3+5)*2 and the model\u2019s first step is 1. 3+5=8, we then prompt it: \u201cNow the original expression becomes: \u201d. The model is expected to return the reduced expression 8*2. We then programmatically evaluate the ground-truth value of both the original expression and this new, simplified expression returned by the model. A step is labeled \u2018correct\u2019 only if the two values are identical. If at any point the value of the simplified expression diverges from the ground-truth value of the original, that step is labeled \u2018incorrect\u2019. While occasionally the model outputs a reduced expression which evaluates to the same value despite being incorrect, this method filters a significant amount of errors. Final Label Agreement. To create our final, high-fidelity label set for the synthetic tasks, we took the intersection of the labels from both methods. That is, a reasoning step was only included in our final dataset if both the LLM-as-a-Judge and the programmatic verifier agreed on its label. This strict agreement protocol ensures an exceptionally clean dataset by filtering out ambiguous cases or potential errors from either annotation method.5 A.3 Human Validation of LLM-as-a-Judge Labels To validate the quality of our LLM-as-a-Judge annotation pipeline, a subset of 100 randomly sampled Boolean and Arithmetic expressions (\u2248700 steps) was independently annotated by four authors. Each annotator labeled half of the 5While this significantly increases our confidence in the label quality, it also has the effect of making the class distribution more imbalanced, as ambiguous incorrect cases are more likely to be filtered out. 15 Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Prompt Template <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|> You are an expert in logical reasoning and boolean algebra.

Placeholders for dynamic content are shown in italics. set, with every step covered by at least two annotators. To mitigate the rarity of incorrect steps, we upsampled the positive class. Because of the extreme class imbalance, Cohen\u2019s Kappa (\u03ba) can underestimate agreement, so we report both \u03ba and raw percentage agreement to give a fuller view of inter-annotator reliability. The results are summarized in Table 10. The agreement among human annotators was moderate as measured by Cohen\u2019s Kappa (\u03ba = 0.42) but high in simple agreement (87.3%). When comparing the consensus human labels to the LLM-as-a-Judge labels, we found fair agreement by Kappa (\u03ba = 0.26) and similarly high simple agreement (84.1%). A qualitative review of the disagreements revealed a recurring pattern: the vast majority of discrepancies, both among humans and between humans and the LLM judge, occurred on steps that followed an initial reasoning error. This highlights the inherent ambiguity of labeling steps on a corrupted computational path and directly motivates our strict truncation policy, as detailed in the following section. A.4 Handling Error Propagation A key challenge in labeling CoT is handling steps that occur after the first mistake. A model can make a technically correct calculation based on a previously incorrect number or expression. This creates a fundamental ambiguity: should a step be judged on its local correctness or its global contribution to the final answer? To illustrate this problem, consider the flawed CoT trace shown in Table 11. The model correctly evaluates the innermost parentheses in Step 1. However, in Step 2, it makes a critical structural error by incorrectly dropping parentheses, which alters the order of operations. The correct simplification in Step 4 should have been \u201cnot (False or True)\u201d. While subsequent steps like 5 and 7 are arithmetically valid given the new, flawed expression from Step 2, their ultimate correctness is undefined as they exist on a corrupted computational path. To avoid this ambiguity and create a clean, well-defined verification task, we adopted a strict truncation policy. For any given reasoning chain, we only retain the steps up to and including the first incorrect step. All subsequent steps are discarded from our dataset. 16 Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Prompt Template <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|> You are an expert in mathematical", "clean, well-defined verification task, we adopted a strict truncation policy.

For the synthetic datasets, we provide a fine-grained breakdown by difficulty, controlled by the number of operators (n). 19 B Transcoder Training Details Our methodology relies on high-fidelity, sparsely activating transcoders to create an interpretable model. To this end, we trained a TopK-Transcoder for each target MLP module in the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model. Our training protocol is designed for robustness and follows several best practices established in recent literature. The transcoders were trained on a high-quality, 10B token subset of the RedPajama-V2 dataset (Weber et al., 2024). We", "trained a TopK-Transcoder for each target MLP module in the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model. Our training protocol is designed for robustness and follows several best practices established in recent literature. The transcoders were trained on a high-quality, 10B token subset of the RedPajama-V2 dataset (Weber et al., 2024). We pre-processed the entire training corpus by concatenating and chunking all passages into a uniform length, and we explicitly discarded all beginning-of-sequence (BOS) tokens6, which we found to be detrimental to stable transcoder training. The transcoder architecture consists of a simple autoencoder with a single hidden layer and a ReLU activation. For each MLP layer in the base model, the transcoder is trained to take the residual stream before the MLP block as input and reconstruct the residual stream after the MLP\u2019s computation. The input dimension matches the Llama 3.1 8B\u2019s MLP hidden dimension (4096), and the latent feature dimension was set to an overcomplete basis of 131,072. We enforced sparsity structurally using a TopK mechanism, preserving only the k = 128 largest feature activations in the forward pass. We followed several established training techniques to improve feature quality and avoid common pitfalls (Gao et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). The decoder weights were normalized to have unit norm, and we did not tie the encoder and decoder weights. To prevent feature collapse, we implemented a dead neuron revival mechanism: if a feature neuron had not activated in 10 million tokens, its activation was forced with an auxiliary loss (coefficient of 1/32). The transcoders were trained for 4 epochs using the AdamW optimizer. The learning rate was set to 7e-5 with a warmup ratio of 0.5. Training was conducted on 4 nodes, each with 8 Nvidia H200 GPUs, using a total batch size of 4,096. This was achieved with a per-device batch size of 32 and gradient accumulation steps. We found that the training loss generally saturated after approximately 4,000 steps, indicating efficient convergence. We show the training loss on selected layers in Figure 5. Figure 5 Transcoder Training Loss Curves. The x-axis represents training steps. In all cases, the loss converges efficiently, generally saturating after approximately 4,000 steps. B.1 Impact of Training Transcoders on Instruction-Tuning Data Since our base LLM used is an instruct model, a natural hypothesis is that transcoders fine-tuned on instruction-following data might learn features more relevant to CoT reasoning, thereby improving verification performance. To test this, we trained an version of our transcoders with instruction-tuning (IT) data. Starting from our pre-trained base transcoders, we continued fine-tuning for 1 epoch on the LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset (Zheng et al., 2024), using the same hyperparameters 6BOS tokens are retained when generating activations but their activations are removed afterward for training the transcoders. 20 Transcoder Training Synthetic (Boolean) Synthetic (Arithmetic) GSM8K AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 Base 75.87 0.97 79.17 92.47 28.92 37.09 70.17 14.3 79.61 + IT Data 76.04 1.20 66.82 91.39 28.44 38.47 72.01 15.40 83.27 Table 14 Performance comparison of CRV with Base transcoders vs. transcoders", "\u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 AUROC \u2191 AUPR \u2191 FPR@95 \u2193 Base 75.87 0.97 79.17 92.47 28.92 37.09 70.17 14.3 79.61 + IT Data 76.04 1.20 66.82 91.39 28.44 38.47 72.01 15.40 83.27 Table 14 Performance comparison of CRV with Base transcoders vs. transcoders further trained on Instruction-Tuning (IT) data. Arrows indicate preferred direction (\u2191higher is better, \u2193lower is better). as for the base transcoder training. Following the methodology of Lieberum et al. (2024), we prepended and appended the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model\u2019s IT prefixes to the user queries and model responses respectively. However, as shown in Table 14, this additional training on IT data did not yield a consistent or meaningful improvement in verification performance on our tasks. This finding is consistent with recent work by Kissane et al. (2024), who found that SAEs trained on base model activations can also faithfully reconstruct the activations of derived IT models. While a deeper mechanistic investigation into how instruction-tuning affects the underlying feature space is a promising direction, we leave this for future work. For our main experiments, we therefore use the more general base transcoders. B.2 Attribution Graph Computation Implementation Details. We use the implementation from Hanna et al. (2025) to compute attribution graphs. The primary hyperparameters were set as follows: a maximum of 4096 feature nodes, attribution traced from a maximum of 10 logit nodes (selected by a cumulative probability threshold of 0.95), and a batch size of 16 for backward passes. All other parameters follow the repository defaults.

Arrows indicate preferred direction (\u2191higher is better, \u2193lower is better). Ablation on Attribution Position. The attribution graph is computed with respect to a specific token position. The choice of this position is a critical methodological decision, as it determines which computational moment we analyze. We investigate two hypotheses: analyzing the state before a step is generated (the \u201cpre-computation\u201d trace) versus the state after it is complete (the \u201cpost-computation\u201d trace). To test this, we compare two settings: (1) Before: computing the graph at the position of the final token of the previous reasoning step. For the first step of the CoT, this corresponds to the final token of the input question. (2) After: computing the graph at the final token of the current reasoning step, which is the default setting for our main experiments. The results, presented in Table 15, show a clear and consistent advantage for the \u201cAfter\u201d setting across nearly all metrics and domains. We hypothesize that this is because the structural signatures of a flawed computation are most fully consolidated", "reasoning step, which is the default setting for our main experiments. The results, presented in Table 15, show a clear and consistent advantage for the \u201cAfter\u201d setting across nearly all metrics and domains. We hypothesize that this is because the structural signatures of a flawed computation are most fully consolidated in the final token\u2019s representation after the step has been fully executed. The pre-computation state may contain signals of intent or planning, but the post-computation state contains the definitive trace of the executed algorithm, including the evidence of its failure. Based on these results, all experiments in the main body of the paper use the \u201cAfter\u201d (current step) position. 21 C Additional Classification Details C.1 Attribution Graph Features Here we give details about the extracted features for our attribution graphs that we used for our classifier. The feature set is organized into three hierarchical levels: 1. Global Graph Statistics: These features provide a high-level summary of the pruned computational graph. \u2022 Node Counts: The total number of active transcoder features, as well as the count of transcoder feature nodes and residual stream nodes remaining after pruning. This captures the overall sparsity and composition of the influential subgraph. \u2022 Logit Statistics: The probability of the top-ranked token and the entropy of the final logit distribution. These classic uncertainty measures serve as simple but informative baseline features. 2. Node Influence and Activation Statistics: This group of features characterizes the properties of the nodes within the pruned graph, moving beyond simple counts. \u2022 Influence Scores: The mean influence of all nodes in the pruned graph, along with the total and mean influence specifically from the residual stream (\u201cerror\u201d) nodes. This helps quantify how much of the final output is attributed to specific learned features versus the model\u2019s direct pass-through states. \u2022 Activation Statistics: For the pruned transcoder feature nodes, we compute the mean, max, and standard deviation of their activation values. This captures the intensity and distribution of the active, interpretable features. A high maximum activation, for instance, might signal that a single, highly decisive feature was responsible for the step. \u2022 Layer-wise Feature Histogram: A histogram of active transcoder features across the model\u2019s layers. This feature vector characterizes the distribution of computational effort across the model\u2019s depth, allowing us to test hypotheses such as whether errors correlate with the activation of components at specific layers. 3. Topological and Path-Based Features: To capture the structure and efficiency of the information flow, we compute a rich set of topological features on the pruned, directed subgraph. \u2022 Edge and Density Statistics: Aggregate statistics on the edge weights (sum, mean, std), the total number of edges, and the graph density. We hypothesize that a sparse, fragmented graph (low density, few edges) may indicate a breakdown in information flow characteristic of an error. \u2022 Centrality Measures: To identify critical \u201chub\u201d nodes in the computation, we calculate the mean and max for both degree centrality and weighted betweenness centrality. These features assess whether influence is concentrated or diffused. \u2022 Connectivity and Path Lengths: The number of weakly connected components and", "characteristic of an error. \u2022 Centrality Measures: To identify critical \u201chub\u201d nodes in the computation, we calculate the mean and max for both degree centrality and weighted betweenness centrality. These features assess whether influence is concentrated or diffused. \u2022 Connectivity and Path Lengths: The number of weakly connected components and the average shortest path length within the largest component. A highly fragmented graph may suggest a failed computation. A particularly crucial feature is the shortest path length from any input token node to any final logit node. This directly measures how efficiently information from the prompt propagates to the final decision. A long or non-existent path is hypothesized to be a strong signal that the model is \u201cignoring\u201d its instructions or context. C.2 Additional Details on Baselines Here we provide additional implementation details for the baseline methods used in our main experiments, ensuring full reproducibility. Black-Box Baselines. This category includes methods that operate solely on the output logits of the final token for each reasoning step. We use implementations from Wang et al. (2025a). 22 Gray-Box Baselines. This category includes methods that leverage the model\u2019s internal hidden states. For CoE (Wang et al., 2025a) and CoT-Kinetics (Bi et al., 2025), which are training-free, we followed the official implementations and protocols described by their respective authors to compute the verification scores. We set \u03b3 in CoT-Kinetics to 0.8, and use mean pooling for reasoning token aggregation. For our supervised LR Probe baseline, the choice of which layer\u2019s hidden states to use is a hyperparameter. To determine the optimal layer for each dataset, we performed a hyperparameter search, training a separate probe on the average hidden states from each of the 32 layers of Llama 3.1 8B Instruct on a small validation split. This process allowed us to identify the layer that contained the most predictive signal for each distinct reasoning task. The best-performing layers, which were subsequently used for the main results reported in Table 1, were found to be: \u2022 Layer 0 (the token embedding layer) for the Synthetic (Boolean) dataset. \u2022 Layer 9 for the Synthetic (Arithmetic) dataset. \u2022 Layer 0 (the token embedding layer) for the GSM8K dataset.

C.3 Additional Classifier and Their Results To validate our choice of a Gradient Boosting classifier for the main experiments, we benchmarked its performance against several standard alternatives on our curated graph feature set. We evaluated a simple baseline, a linear model, and another tree-based ensemble to understand the trade-offs between model complexity and verification performance. For this analysis and main experiments in this work, we used the", "main experiments, we benchmarked its performance against several standard alternatives on our curated graph feature set. We evaluated a simple baseline, a linear model, and another tree-based ensemble to understand the trade-offs between model complexity and verification performance. For this analysis and main experiments in this work, we used the default hyperparameters from the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) for each classifier, as an initial, non-exhaustive hyperparameter search did not yield any significant improvements, suggesting that the feature set itself provides a strong signal that is not overly sensitive to classifier configuration. The results are presented in Table 16. As expected, the Dummy classifier, which makes predictions based on the training set\u2019s class distribution, performs near chance level (AUROC \u224850). This confirms that our graph features contain a significant predictive signal that is non-trivial to learn. Interestingly, a standard Logistic Regression model achieves competitive performance, yielding the best AUROC on two of the three datasets and the strongest overall results on GSM8K. This indicates that the features are highly informative even with a simple linear model. However, the tree-based ensembles often achieve superior performance on other key metrics. The Random Forest classifier, for instance, yields a substantially higher AUPR and lower FPR@95 on the complex Arithmetic dataset, suggesting its ability to capture non-linear feature interactions is critical for high-precision verification in that domain. Overall, no single classifier is dominant across all domains and metrics. We chose Gradient Boosting for our main experiments as it consistently provides a strong and robust performance profile, but these results highlight that the optimal choice of diagnostic classifier may be domain-specific. C.4 Additional Results for RQs Here we provide additional results for our research questions. We first show distributions of highly predictive features for correct versus incorrect reasoning steps on our synthetic datasets (Figure 6 for arithmetic; Figure 7 for Boolean). Next, we display the distributions of full feature vectors after t-SNE projection in Figure 8. We demonstrate another casual intervention with a concrete case study on the arithmetic task, where we correct a subtle mathematical parsing error not by suppressing a faulty feature, but by amplifying a correct one.

As shown in Table 17, the model initially misinterprets the leading unary minus, treating it as a subtraction from an implicit -1 and producing the incorrect result of -42. Our CRV classifier flagged this step as incorrect, and its feature importance analysis suggested that the error stemmed from the absence of a strong \u201cmultiplication\u201d signal. Hypothesizing that the model failed to recognize the unary minus as a multiplication by -1, we performed a direct intervention. We identified a transcoder feature from the graph whose semantics corresponded to multiplication and, using a forward hook, manually amplified its activation value just before the model generated its erroneous step. The effect was immediate and successful. As shown in the \u201cAfter Intervention\u201d column, this boost was sufficient to steer the model onto the correct computational path. It now correctly multiplies by -1 and arrives at the final answer of -41.

Their role was strictly limited to improving the clarity, conciseness, and grammatical correctness of the text. The authors take full responsibility for all content and any remaining errors. E Limitations Our work introduces a new methodology for the scientific analysis of reasoning, and its limitations are intrinsically linked to its design as a white-box, mechanistic instrument. Computational Intensity. A primary limitation of CRV is its computational intensity. The process, which involves training a suite of transcoders, replacing model modules, and constructing a detailed attribution graph for every reasoning step, is orders of magnitude more resource-intensive than black-box or gray-box verification methods. This cost is a direct consequence of our white-box approach, which prioritizes mechanistic depth over practical efficiency. As such, CRV in its current form is positioned as a scientific tool for deep analysis, not as a scalable, real-time verifier for production systems. Aggregative vs. Feature-Level Analysis. The feature set used by CRV is primarily aggregative; it captures statistical and topological properties of the graph, such as node counts, influence scores, and density. As an early work, it does not yet fully exploit the semantic content of the individual transcoder features that constitute the graph\u2019s nodes. For instance, our current classifier learns statistical correlations over the entire feature set; it does not reason symbolically about whether a specific feature for numerical addition is appropriately activated by numerical inputs. This represents a significant opportunity. A promising future direction lies in developing more sophisticated classifiers or rule-based systems that operate directly on the semantics of these disentangled features, paving the way for a new class of neuro-symbolic verifiers. Generalizability of Error Signatures. Our empirical results are based on a single model family (Llama 3.1) at the 8B scale. Whether the precise structural fingerprints we identified generalize to different architectural paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Experts, or across significant model scales (e.g., 70B and larger) remains an open question. Furthermore, as our cross-domain experiments revealed, the error signatures are highly domain-specific. Our work provides a strong foundation and a methodology for discovering these signatures, but further studies are needed to determine if", "paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Experts, or across significant model scales (e.g., 70B and larger) remains an open question. Furthermore, as our cross-domain experiments revealed, the error signatures are highly domain-specific. Our work provides a strong foundation and a methodology for discovering these signatures, but further studies are needed to determine if more universal principles of computational failure exist. Fidelity of Interpretability Tools. The validity of our analysis is contingent on the quality and fidelity of the underlying interpretability tools. The features identified by our transcoders, while demonstrably useful, represent one possible sparse basis and are not exhaustive. Similarly, the attribution method provides a powerful but ultimately incomplete approximation of the true information flow within the model. Future improvements in these foundational techniques, such as the development of more faithful sparse autoencoders or more precise attribution methods, will directly enhance the resolution and reliability of analyses like ours. 26", "LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL PROMPT DATASETS: AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS Yuanming Zhang*, 1 , Yan Lin*, 2 , Arijit Khan\u2020, 3, 2 , Huaiyu Wan1 1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, China 2 Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark 3 Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, USA 1{ymzhang23, hywan}@bjtu.edu.cn, 2lyan@cs.aau.dk, 3arijitk@bgsu.edu ABSTRACT A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a large lan- guage model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of ap- plications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we\u2013for the first time\u2013have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonali- ties and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt opti- mization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and depen- dency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaning- fulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Prompt-Datasets-7416. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent large language model (LLM) advancements have spurred the proliferation of custom prompts optimized for specific tasks. This trend spans technology communities\u2013from GitHub repositories (e.g., f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts (Ak\u0131n)) and Reddit forums (e.g., ChatGPTPromptGenius (Cha)) to platforms like PromptBase and PromptGenius (Pro, a). AI researchers and domain experts also share prompts to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative innovation (Conover et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). Collectively, these datasets enable detailed analysis of usage patterns and high-performing prompt designs. Notably, prior research has largely neglected comprehensive examinations of available prompt datasets. To address this gap, we apply stringent criteria to select, refine, and evaluate datasets that enable analysis of diverse prompts across multiple sources, content types, and target applications. Our survey encompasses over 1.22 TB of data, comprising more than 673M prompt instances from 129 heterogeneous sources. Our first contribution is a hierarchical taxonomy of LLM prompt datasets that serves as a detailed reference for researchers and informs future studies. Next, we perform multi-level linguistic analysis\u2014lexical, syntactic, and semantic\u2014across seven meticulously selected, large-scale, diverse, and representative prompt datasets. By integrating statistical and machine learning methods, our study reveals key insights into compositional patterns, domain-specific variations, and unique linguistic properties that distinguish these prompts from other text corpora, such as literature and web content. Finally, we propose a prompt optimization method leveraging part-of-speech and dependency embed- dings.

(Liu et al., 2024) discuss broadly the topic of datasets for LLMs, but emphasize more on corpus datasets for training and fine-tuning LLMs rather than providing a detailed analysis of prompt datasets. A few works consider LLM prompt datasets but with a narrower objective compared to ours. For instance, (Zhang et al., 2023) and OpenCodeInstruct (Ahmad et al., 2025a) focus only on datasets for instruction tuning\u2013a technique for fine-tuning LLMs using carefully constructed instruction-response pairs. LLMSecEval (Tony et al., 2023) introduces a prompt dataset specifically designed for evaluating the safety of codes generated by LLMs, whereas Lu et al. (2024) survey datasets for LLMs\u2019 evaluation. Tools and frameworks for prompt engineering. The prompt report (Schulhoff et al., 2024) offers a thorough survey of prompt engineering techniques, providing detailed scheme definitions and corresponding examples. Several works focus on developing tools that streamline prompt construction. Both PromptAid (Mishra et al., 2025) and PromptLandscape (Wang et al., 2024a) present visual support systems to simplify the creation and engineering of prompts. PEPR (Feffer et al., 2024) assesses various prompt combinations to determine the most optimal one for a given scenario. Saletta & Ferretti (2024) introduce a grammar-based evolutionary method to systematically optimize prompts for specific use cases. Promptaware (Chen et al., 2025) integrates software engineering principles into the prompt engineering process. There are also works proposing solutions for generating prompts for specific scenarios. PromptAgent (Wang et al., 2024b) introduces a model that automatically crafts and optimizes prompts with quality on par with those handcrafted by experts. In contrast to previous studies, our work is the first to compile a comprehensive list of prompt datasets and we also extract valuable insights through their analysis. 3 PROMPT DATASETS DISCOVERY AND REFINEMENT Data discovery guideline. We employ a systematic dataset discovery process across multiple sources to compile a diverse repository of prompt datasets. Our objective is to capture real-world, user- generated prompts, instruction-following interactions, and domain-specific scenarios. In particular, our primary objectives for datasets discovery are three-fold: (1) collecting datasets that are composed of prompts, i.e., natural language instructions that describe a certain task the LLM should perform and guide the LLM towards generating a desired output; (2) ensuring that the extracted data cover various domains, including day-to-day scenarios such as travel planning, professional scenarios such as academic writing, and specialized scenarios such as healthcare and finance; and (3) allowing different forms of prompts, e.g., single instruction, conversations, etc. Data discovery process. We collect publicly available datasets from the following four types of sources. First, we consult dataset collection platforms, including Hugging Face Datasets (hug), Kaggle (kag), Google Dataset Search (goo), and Papers with Code (pap). Targeted searches using keywords, e.g., \"prompt dataset\", \"instruction-following dataset\", and \"conversation dataset\" yield", "Data discovery process. We collect publicly available datasets from the following four types of sources. First, we consult dataset collection platforms, including Hugging Face Datasets (hug), Kaggle (kag), Google Dataset Search (goo), and Papers with Code (pap). Targeted searches using keywords, e.g., \"prompt dataset\", \"instruction-following dataset\", and \"conversation dataset\" yield 60 prompt datasets. Second, we review the latest academic publications, specifically papers on prompt engineering, natural language understanding, and dialogue systems, published at NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML between 2023-2024 and identify 73 datasets shared across them. Third, we also examine public repositories by systematically surveying open-source GitHub projects using keywords, e.g., \u201cprompt collection\u201d, \u201cLLM prompts\u201d, and \u201cinstruction dataset\u201d. We identify 21 prompt repositories that typically contain curated prompt lists derived from user interactions or synthesized from public APIs. Some of these repositories are \u201cawesome-lists\u201d, which are curated collections of high-quality prompts or links to prompt datasets. Notable examples include Awesome Instruction Datasets (Nie), Prompt Engineering Guide (Saravia, 2022), and LLMDataHub (Zhao). Finally, we extract 14 datasets from popular websites dedicated to prompt-sharing, including Prompt Genius (Pro, b) and BoredHumans (bor). These platforms feature user-written prompts for practical purposes. Data filtering. We remove duplicate entries (e.g., CVQA (Romero et al., 2024) appears in both Hugging Face and NeurIPS 2024) and then filter the remaining candidates using four quality criteria 2 for inclusion in this paper. First, Dataset size. We prioritize datasets containing at least 1K prompts to ensure robustness in diversity and statistical power. In contrast, due to their generally limited scope, user-shared datasets are filtered with a minimum threshold of 50 prompts. Second, Data quality. We evaluate the quality of prompts based on their cleanliness. Most datasets (e.g., OpenCodeReasoning (Ahmad et al., 2025b)) on data hosting platforms (e.g., Hugging Face and Kaggle) are well-formatted and clean. For the remaining data, we exclude samples with inconsistent formatting or unclear structure. For instance, the Prompt Engineering Guide\u2013a resource that offers both curated prompt datasets and instructional examples\u2013contains many illustrative prompts scattered throughout the material and are thus omitted from our datasets. Third, Data relevance. We assess whether the prompts are aligned with our data discovery guidelines, specifically emphasizing on those that represent common usage scenarios for broad audiences (e.g., Chinese-DeepSeek-R1-Distill-data- 110k (Liu et al., 2025a)), and tasks from various domains (e.g., Medical Verifiable Problems (Chen et al., 2024), OpenMathReasoning (Moshkov et al., 2025)). Datasets that violate our discovery guidelines are omitted. For instance, the PersonaHub dataset (Per) is excluded because it does not meet data discovery guideline (1), which mandates that prompts be linked to specific, well-defined tasks. Although PersonaHub demonstrates the potential of synthetic personas in generating diverse content (e.g., reasoning problems, dialogues, or non-player character behaviors), it predominantly comprises persona descriptions without clear task formulation. Fourth, Accessibility. Datasets must be publicly accessible or retrievable via automated crawling, and their licensing terms must permit research use. After filtering, we identify 129 distinct prompt datasets for taxonomic analysis (\u00a74). 4 DATASET TAXONOMY We categorize our collected prompt datasets across multiple dimensions and hierarchies, creating a detailed taxonomy illustrated in Figure 1. We discuss certain", "or retrievable via automated crawling, and their licensing terms must permit research use. After filtering, we identify 129 distinct prompt datasets for taxonomic analysis (\u00a74). 4 DATASET TAXONOMY We categorize our collected prompt datasets across multiple dimensions and hierarchies, creating a detailed taxonomy illustrated in Figure 1. We discuss certain key aspects in this taxonomy below. Source. We classify prompt sources by publisher, release channel, and generation process. Publisher denotes the source\u2019s identity and intent. We distinguish among end users who share prompts for practical tasks like writing/ coding (e.g., Prompt Genius), LLM researchers who publish prompts for fine-tuning and benchmarking (e.g., OpenMathReasoning by NVIDIA), and domain scientists who use LLMs in their specific fields (e.g., ChatGPT Data Science Prompts (Tang)). Release channel refers to the platform where a dataset is published. Common platforms include data hosting sites such as GitHub, Hugging Face, and Kaggle, where structured prompt formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) dominate. Personal sites or notes (e.g., Notion workspaces) often host informal, user-oriented prompts. Dedicated prompt sharing websites vary from open-access (e.g., QuickRef.ME (Qui)) to commercial marketplaces (e.g., PromptBase). Social media, like Reddit\u2019s r/ChatGPTPromptGe- nius, also plays a key role in community-driven prompt exchange. Generation process describes how the prompts are created. Human-generated prompts are either manually authored (e.g., databricks-dolly-15k (Conover et al., 2023)) or collected from user queries (e.g., ShareGPT (Li)), Model-generated prompts include those created via self-instruct techniques (Wang et al., 2023) (e.g., Self-Instruct), multi-agent simulations (e.g., AI Society (Li et al., 2023a)), or reverse instruction generation (e.g., LongForm (K\u00f6ksal et al., 2023)). Finally, derivative datasets build on existing resources through task expansion or reformatted aggregation (e.g., Flan 2022 (Fla), xP3 (Muennighoff et al., 2022)). Content. Prompt datasets are characterized by distinct linguistic and structural attributes. Linguisti- cally, they may be monolingual or multilingual; in the latter case, datasets are deemed semantically aligned if each entry includes multilingual counterparts with identical semantics, thereby enhancing LLM performance (Li et al., 2023b). In terms of display form, prompts appear either as conversation (e.g., single-round, multi-round, or tree-structured) or instruction (e.g., user prompt, system prompt). The prompt format\u2013ranging from free-form to structured (e.g., JSON, Markdown, HTML), or a combination thereof\u2013substantially influences LLM response quality (Liu et al., 2025b). Finally, datasets differ in their use of placeholders, which allow for text substitution and enable diversified prompt transformations (Shin et al., 2020). Prompt engineering methods are critical for enhancing prompt performance (Sahoo et al., 2025). Common techniques include few-shot (Brown et al., 2020), role playing (Zhang et al., 2018), chain-of- thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), and rephrase-and-respond (Deng et al., 2023).

Moreover, datasets may include extra attributes, including labeled data (e.g., response supervision, safety labels), analytical data (e.g., token count, user behavior), structural information (e.g., timestamp, multi-turn context), and ground truth (e.g., gold answers, attribution references)\u2013as seen in datasets including hh-rlhf (Bai et al., 2022), UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023), and databricks- dolly-15k. Additional tags may indicate usage context, such as associated models, cultural regions, or domain specificity. Finally, datasets vary in dynamicity (i.e., static vs. dynamically updated) and modality (i.e., single-modal vs. cross-/multi-modal). For example, awesome-chatgpt-prompts is a dynamically updated prompts collection, while PLM-Video-Human (Cho et al., 2025) supports multi-modal learning for video understanding. Target. Target defines the purpose and applications of prompt datasets. From cognitive intents and applications perspective, prompts may aim for information retrieval (e.g., databricks-dolly-15k includes information extraction category), text processing (e.g., StrategyQA (Str) requires implicit reasoning steps in the question), analytical decision-making (e.g., medical-o1-reasoning-SFT (Chen et al., 2024) for consultation decision), logical reasoning (e.g., DeepSeek-Prover-V1 (Xin et al., 2024)), creative generation (e.g., No Robots (Rajani et al., 2023) includes generation cat- 4 egory), or emotion-oriented (e.g., empathetic-dialogues-facebook-ai (Emp)) tasks. In terms of downstream tasks, we identify three major categories: data-oriented (e.g., synthetic data genera- tion, data augmentation), model-oriented (e.g., model training, finetuning, benchmarking, RLHF), and prompt-oriented (e.g., prompt composition studies, prompt engineering effectiveness analysis, instruction pattern analysis). Among these, instruction fine-tuning datasets represent a prominent and widely-used subset of prompt datasets (Liu et al., 2024). These datasets comprise instruction-response pairs, where the \"instruction\" serves as a prompt and the \"response\" represents", "finetuning, benchmarking, RLHF), and prompt-oriented (e.g., prompt composition studies, prompt engineering effectiveness analysis, instruction pattern analysis). Among these, instruction fine-tuning datasets represent a prominent and widely-used subset of prompt datasets (Liu et al., 2024). These datasets comprise instruction-response pairs, where the \"instruction\" serves as a prompt and the \"response\" represents the target model output. They are primarily employed for supervised fine-tuning to enhance model capability and controllability. As a result, models trained on these datasets exhibit superior alignment with human intent, improved instruction-following, and increased safety characteristics (Zhang et al., 2023). Furthermore, the instructions in these datasets often reflect real-world user queries, making them both practical for deployment and valuable for prompt-related research. Notable examples are Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), OASST1 (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023), and FLAN 2022. We summarize the key characetristics and metadata attributes\u2013 including sources\u2013of all our collected and filtered 129 prompt datasets in Appendix E. 5 PROMPT DATA ANALYSIS We next conduct an in-depth analysis across three linguistic levels\u2014lexical, syntactic, and seman- tic\u2014of prompts derived from seven distinct sources. Our approach integrates statistical techniques with machine learning methods to identify compositional patterns and inter-source variations. 5.1 DATASET SELECTION In order to ensure reliable analysis of prompt characteristics, we curate multiple prompt-centric datasets with the following selection principles. (1) Language consistency. Only English-language data have been included to ensure uniform linguistic features and avoid cross-linguistic biases. (2) Exclusion of benchmark-style prompts. Prompts designed for LLM performance evaluations (e.g., PHYBench (Qiu et al., 2025)) are excluded to focus on natural usage scenarios. (3) Source and content diversity. To achieve sufficient coverage and reduce sampling bias, we have selected datasets that differ in publisher type (i.e., end user vs. LLM researcher and domain scientist), instruction generation method (i.e., human vs. model generated), and domain scope (i.e., general vs. domain- specific tasks). Following our selection principles, we curated seven representative datasets spanning different user types, instruction methods, and domains. For end users, general-domain prompts include single-turn prompts (BoredHumans) and multi-turn conversations (ShareGPT), while business- domain single-turn prompts are represented by 1100+ ChatGPT Prompts for Business. For LLM researchers, human-generated datasets include databricks-dolly-15k and OASST1, and model- generated prompts are captured by Self-Instruct. For domain scientists, we include model-generated medical prompts from medical-o1-reasoning-SFT. This collection ensures diversity in publisher type, prompt structure, and application domain. \u2022 1100+ ChatGPT Prompts for Business (1.1k-business). A curated dataset of 1 235 prompts oriented toward professional and business-related use cases, such as marketing, productivity, and decision-making. It represents structured, domain-specific prompting behavior (1.1). \u2022 BoredHumans Prompts (BoredHumans). A smaller collection of 964 prompts compiled from publicly shared prompts on the boredhumans.com website. Some of the prompts on this site come from other community shared sources (e.g., awesome-chatgpt-prompts). It reflects community- created content and captures user creativity and experimentation (bor). \u2022 databricks-dolly-15k (dolly-15k). This dataset includes 15 000 human-authored instruc- tion\u2013response pairs covering a range of everyday tasks. It is single-turn and domain-general, curated to support instruction-following models (Conover et al., 2023). \u2022 medical-o1-reasoning-SFT (medical-o1). Synthetic data of 90 120 open-ended questions and GPT-4o generated CoTs and", "and experimentation (bor). \u2022 databricks-dolly-15k (dolly-15k). This dataset includes 15 000 human-authored instruc- tion\u2013response pairs covering a range of everyday tasks. It is single-turn and domain-general, curated to support instruction-following models (Conover et al., 2023). \u2022 medical-o1-reasoning-SFT (medical-o1). Synthetic data of 90 120 open-ended questions and GPT-4o generated CoTs and responses. Open-ended questions are reformatted by GPT-4o based 5 on close-set medical examination questions. The dataset is used to fine-tune HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen et al., 2024). \u2022 OASST1. The Open Assistant dataset (OASST1) contains over 30 000 human-written messages arranged in dialogue trees. It emphasizes cooperative, open-domain assistant behavior and includes branching conversations rather than linear interactions (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023). \u2022 Self-Instruct. A synthetic dataset with 82 646 prompts generated by large language models based on a small seed pool of human-written instructions. For every generation step, it samples 6 human- written tasks and 2 model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity (Wang et al., 2023). \u2022 ShareGPT. A large-scale collection of approximately 90 000 ChatGPT conversation logs shared by users. It represents multi-turn, organically generated interactions and captures diverse user intentions in real-world usage scenarios (Li). We present the key characteristics of these seven datasets in Table 1. Table 1: Key characteristics of the seven datasets selected for analysis, where size represents the number of prompts after preprocessing removes incorrectly extracted or malformed entries.

Initially, all tokens are lemmatized to mitigate inflectional variability, after which we extract 3-gram, 4-gram, and 5-gram sequences to compute their frequency distributions. By analyzing high-frequency n-grams, we identify prevalent instruction templates, keyword combinations, and syntactic patterns, laying the groundwork for subsequent syntactic and semantic investigations. 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 n-grams count / prompts count what be the be able to I want to be go to I do not I want you to please write in english write in english language make sure to cite with the same name please write in english language make sure to cite result sure to cite result use the provide web search result write a comprehensive reply to n-grams 0.0449 0.0282 0.0276 0.0236 0.0228 0.0175 0.0120 0.0120 0.0082 0.0081 0.0120 0.0080 0.0080 0.0080 0.0080 n 3 4 5 (a) Top-5 n-grams of ShareGPT (n=3, 4, 5) 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 n-grams count / prompts count what be the most likely be the most likely diagnosis what be the most appropriate which of the following be of the following be the what be the difference between what be", "n-grams of ShareGPT (n=3, 4, 5) 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 n-grams count / prompts count what be the most likely be the most likely diagnosis what be the most appropriate which of the following be of the following be the what be the difference between what be some of the I want you to act want you to act as you to act as a please write in english language make sure to cite result sure to cite result use the provide web search result write a comprehensive reply to 5-grams 0.1210 0.0641 0.0511 0.0360 0.0284 0.0134 0.0099 0.0077 0.0071 0.0057 0.0120 0.0080 0.0080 0.0080 0.0080 Dataset medical-o1 OASST1 ShareGPT (b) Top-5 5-grams of medical-o1, OASST1, ShareGPT Figure 2: Comparison of 3/4/5-grams in the same dataset and 5-grams across multiple datasets. The ratio is defined as the count of the specific n-gram divided by the count of prompts in the dataset. More comprehensive comparison data and analysis can be found in Appendix F.1. Analysis of results. The n-gram frequency distributions reveal several notable patterns that highlight the distinct functional and stylistic characteristics across datasets. 6 (1) High-frequency n-grams reveal domain and prompt-engineering differences, such as role-playing cues in OASST1 (\u201cyou to act as\u201d) versus medical reasoning in medical-o1 (\u201cwhat be the,\u201d \u201cthe most likely diagnosis\u201d). (2) While 3-grams capture general-purpose queries or commands (e.g., \u201cwhat be the,\u201d \u201cI want to\u201d), longer n-grams (4\u20135) reflect task-specific patterns, as in ShareGPT where frequent 5-grams (\u201cplease write in English language,\u201d \u201cwrite a comprehensive reply to\u201d) highlight its instruction-following orientation. (3) Compared to Google Books 5-grams (e.g., \u201cat the end of the,\u201d \u201cin whole or in part\u201d) that serve narrative or descriptive purposes, prompt datasets exhibit inquiry- or command-focused n-grams, underscoring a clear divergence in linguistic patterns across corpora. 5.3 SYNTACTIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS To gain deeper insights into the linguistic structure of prompts, we perform syntactic analysis from three perspectives: dependency parsing (Nivre, 2003), part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Brill, 1992), and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring (Salton & Buckley, 1988). These features are both descriptive and can be aggregated into vector representations for tasks like prompt classification. For comparative analysis with non-prompt text datasets, we have used Universal Dependencies corpora for English: EWT (Silveira et al., 2014) and ParTUT (Sanguinetti & Bosco, 2014), where EWT contains informal contents\u2013blog, social, reviews, email, and web, and ParTUT contains more formal contents\u2013legal, news, and wiki. Table 2: Top-8 dependency types, with the values indicating their proportions in the dataset. The depen- dency types represent syntactic relationships between words in a sentence: punct\u2013punctuation marks; prep\u2013 prepositions; det\u2013determiners (e.g., \"the\", \"a\"); pobj\u2013prepositional objects; dobj\u2013direct objects; nsubj\u2013nominal subjects; and ROOT\u2013the sentence\u2019s main verb or predicate. Note that spaCy\u2019s (en_core_web_sm) de- pendency labels do not entirely conform to the Universal Dependencies standard; non-conforming labels are represented with a dash (\"-\") in cross-corpus comparisons.

For the EWT and ParTUT corpora, we rely on officially published dependency type annotations. This analysis reveals systematic variations in linguistic style across prompt sources. Additionally, we track verb\u2013object (dobj) pairs to capture the task-oriented diversity of the prompts (see Figure 3). Analysis of Results. Table 2 shows the distribution of eight common dependency types across seven prompt datasets and two reference corpora (EWT and ParTUT), revealing three key findings. 7 Table 3: The top-7 Parts-of-Speech, with each value indicating its proportion in a dataset.

(2) In contrast, the 1.1k-business dataset favors concise, goal-driven imperatives with bare noun phrases as direct objects (dobj, 0.09) and minimal use of determiners (det, 0.05), aligning with its project-planning focus. (3) Verb\u2013noun dependency analysis further distinguishes domains: medical instructions cluster around technical, domain-specific pairs like \u201chave history\u201d and \u201cexperience pain,\u201d while datasets such as ShareGPT use broader, generic pairs like \u201cwrite answer\u201d and \u201cuse code\u201d. These syntactic patterns highlight each corpus\u2019 thematic priorities and inform strategies for domain-aware model training. These findings highlight the stylistic diversity among prompt datasets, where domain and intent directly influence grammatical structure. Medical prompts stress detailed specificity and descriptive richness, while business prompts favor concise, directive clarity, illustrating the functional interplay between form and purpose. 5.3.2 PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING We annotate the datasets with POS tags and calculate the distribution of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Table 3 summarizes the functional composition of prompts, contrasting content and function words. For example, a high verb frequency indicates action-oriented prompts, while a predominance of nouns suggests more objective narratives. These distributional differences reveal stylistic and structural variations across sources. Analysis of results. (1) Domain-specific datasets such as 1.1k-business and medical-o1 exhibit a noun proportion of \u22480.26, surpassing that found in formal corpora like ParTUT. This reflects a concept-driven focus on domain entities and technical terms. (2) Additionally, medical-o1 also registers an unusually high adjective ratio (0.11), indicating a repeated emphasis on specifying medical attributes and conditions, consistent with the descriptive nature of clinical reasoning tasks. 5.3.3 TF-IDF ANALYSIS Table 4: Top-3 tokens with the highest TF-IDF weights per dataset Dataset Top-3 tokens 1.1k-business content (0.308), email (0.284), marketing (0.245) BoredHumans act (0.269), want (0.261), write (0.217) dolly-15k list (0.338), given (0.246), following (0.241) medical-o1 old (0.427), year (0.367), patient (0.256) OASST1 write (0.307), like (0.216), does (0.207) Self-Instruct output (0.766), input (0.292), task (0.243) ShareGPT write (0.190), use (0.180), data (0.157) We analyze lexical patterns across prompt datasets using TF-IDF. Each dataset\u2019s prompts are concate- nated into a single document (yielding seven corpus- level documents), and a TF-IDF vectorizer (with a 5000-word limit and English stopwords removed) computes sparse term importance representations. We then assess inter-dataset lexical similarity via pairwise cosine similarity (Figure 3c) and extract the top three highest-weight tokens per dataset for intra-dataset characterization (Table 4). Analysis of results. (1) Intra-dataset analysis delineates each dataset\u2019s lexical focus and stylistic characteristics. For instance, 1.1k-business emphasizes business-specific terms like \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cemail\u201d, while BoredHumans features imperatives such as \u201cact\u201d, indicative", "cosine similarity (Figure 3c) and extract the top three highest-weight tokens per dataset for intra-dataset characterization (Table 4). Analysis of results. (1) Intra-dataset analysis delineates each dataset\u2019s lexical focus and stylistic characteristics. For instance, 1.1k-business emphasizes business-specific terms like \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cemail\u201d, while BoredHumans features imperatives such as \u201cact\u201d, indicative of role-playing instruc- tions. Similarly, Self-Instruct shows a dominant TF-IDF score for \u201coutput\u201d (0.772), highlighting a structural prompt style based on explicit instruction\u2013response formats. (2) Inter-dataset compari- son. TF-IDF vectors show varying overlaps across datasets. The highest cosine similarity between OASST1 and ShareGPT suggests a similar vocabulary\u2014likely due to shared human-generation processes. In contrast, Self-Instruct is lexically distant from the others, especially 1.1k-business and medical-o1, reflecting stylistic and domain-specific differences. 8 5.4 SEMANTIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS We analyze prompt semantics by encoding each prompt into a 384-dimensional dense vector using Sentence-BERT\u2019s pretrained model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). Each prompt is encoded into a 384-dimensional dense vector that captures its semantic content. These embeddings serve as the foundation for classification, clustering, and visualization analysis. We perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce sentence embeddings to two dimensions. For fair comparison, we uniformly at random sample 500 prompts per dataset and visualize their distribution (Figure 4). 0.5 0.0 0.5 PCA Dimension 1 0.4 0.0 0.4 PCA Dimension 2 Dataset OASST1 ShareGPT dolly-15k (a) human-generated 0.5 0.0 0.5 PCA Dimension 1 0.4 0.0 0.4 PCA Dimension 2 (b) medical-o1 0.5 0.0 0.5 PCA Dimension 1 0.4 0.0 0.4 PCA Dimension 2 (c) Self-Instruct Figure 4: Semantic prompt embeddings distribution. Analysis of results. (1) Wide coverage in Self- Instruct: The Self-Instruct dataset exhibits the most dispersed and evenly distributed semantic space, suggesting a broad topical coverage. This aligns with the self-instruction paradigm\u2019s goal of generating diverse instruction types. (2) Se- mantic cohesion in specific domains: Prompts from medical-o1 and 1.1k-business form more concentrated clusters, indicating domain-specific semantic cohesion. (3) Overlap among human- generated sets: The embeddings of dolly-15k, OASST1, and ShareGPT overlap substantially across both PCA dimensions. This suggests that these datasets share stylistic and semantic character- istics, possibly due to their common reliance on human-LLM interactions for data generation. 6 APPLICATION Building on the above analysis, we propose a new prompt engineering method that leverages structural linguistic features. Specifically, we take the average of the high-dimensional embeddings of POS tags and dependency relations from the analyzed dataset to define a centroid representation. This centroid captures the \u201ccentral\u201d syntactic patterns that are associated with higher-performing prompts. For each target prompt, we first analyze its POS and dependency embeddings to identify deviations from the centroid. Based on this analysis, a modification plan is generated, specifying how the prompt\u2019s syntactic structure should be adjusted. The LLM is then guided to rewrite the prompt according to this plan, producing an optimized prompt whose embeddings are closer to the centroid. This process allows peripheral prompts that initially deviate from effective syntactic patterns to be systematically aligned with the central region of the embedding space. Math: Seating Problem In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with", "optimized prompt whose embeddings are closer to the centroid. This process allows peripheral prompts that initially deviate from effective syntactic patterns to be systematically aligned with the central region of the embedding space. Math: Seating Problem In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side? (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.) How many different ways can we arrange 8 people around a square table, with 2 people seated on each side? Remember, two arrangements are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the table. Optimize based on part-of-speech and dependency embeddings \u2026 In conclusion, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotations as equivalent, is: 5040 \u2717 \u2713 \u2026 Thus, there are 10080 different ways to arrange 8 people around a square table with 2 people seated on each side where arrangements that can be obtained from each other through rotation are considered identical. from OpenAI/PRM800K gpt-4o-mini gpt-4o-mini Figure 5: A case study of prompt optimization To illustrate the practical impact of this approach, we present one representative case study in Figure 5, where our prompt optimization successfully corrected the model\u2019s initial incorrect responses, while another case study and the complete text are provided in Appendix F.4. By aligning prompts with this centroid, our method aims to improve the likelihood that the LLM generates correct or more meaningful responses. 7 CONCLUSIONS We addressed the underexplored challenge of collecting and categorizing LLM prompt datasets into a structured taxonomy. Our lexical, syntactic, and semantic explorations uncover key linguistic patterns, inter-dataset similarities, differences, and distinctions from other corpora such as literature and web content. Our novel application enhances domain-specific prompt filtering pipelines by 9 automatically flagging irrelevant or malformed prompts in an unsupervised, data-driven manner before inference. Future work should leverage these extensive datasets to advance LLM architectures, prompt engineering, and human-AI interactions\u2014including adaptive quality assessments and pricing models in AI prompt marketplaces.

PromptBench: A unified library for evaluation of large language models. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 25(1), 2024. ISSN 1532-4435. 14 A LIMITATIONS AND DISUCUSSION While our analysis offers valuable insights, several limitations remain. Below, we outline these limitations and discuss their potential impact on our findings. Limited Datasets for Analysis To facilitate a focused analysis, we selected seven datasets represent- ing various publisher types, generation methods, display formats, and domain categories. However, the number of datasets in each category is relatively limited, which may affect the representativeness of the results. Additionally, the scope of categories included in our analysis could be further expanded in future work to improve the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. Lack of Evaluation of Prompt Effects Due to the diversity of tasks among our selected datasets, this study does not include an evaluation of prompt effects. Our research primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods, and thus does not leverage Large Language Models to analyze the impact of prompts. We recognize this as a limitation and suggest that future research incorporate prompt-based approaches for a more thorough assessment. The amount of prompt data is growing rapidly. Based on our proposed taxonomy, we encourage further studies to continuously explore and update analyses in accordance with emerging trends. Additionally, we hope that future research will conduct more in-depth experiments on prompt datasets, which could be vital for advancing prompt design. B LLM USAGE LLMs are only involved in this work for grammatical checking and smart auto-completion during code implementation. C ETHICS STATEMENT Our work conforms to the ICLR Code of Ethics by responsibly compiling and analyzing existing prompt datasets rather than collecting new sensitive data. We ensure proper documentation of all datasets analyzed, respect original licenses and sources, and have made our code and datasets publicly available for transparency and reproducibility. The research poses minimal risk for misuse as it focuses on analytical insights rather than creating potentially harmful technologies, and we have documented our methodology thoroughly to enable external scrutiny. D REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We are committed to ensuring the reproducibility of our results. All code used in this research is publicly available through links in our abstract. The repository includes detailed instructions for dataset preprocessing, and running experiments. We also specify the exact", "our methodology thoroughly to enable external scrutiny. D REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We are committed to ensuring the reproducibility of our results. All code used in this research is publicly available through links in our abstract. The repository includes detailed instructions for dataset preprocessing, and running experiments. We also specify the exact versions of dependencies and libraries used in our experiments. All datasets employed in this study are either publicly accessible or their sources are clearly documented. Random seeds are set for all experiments where applicable to minimize variability.

F ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS F.1 TOKEN-LEVEL ANALYSIS In this section, we provide the comparision of 3/4/5-grams for all datasets (except ShareGPT, which is displayed in the main paper) in Figure 6, and the top-5 n-grams comparison across datasets in Figure 7. The conclusions drawn from these figures are consistent with the main paper, for example, high- frequency n-grams phrases mainly show command sentences and topic content. In addition, there are two other findings: 1. The n-grams phrases of some datasets include abnormal content (e.g. \u201cidentify which instrument be string\u201d in dolly-15 and \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d in Self-Instruct), which indicates that there is a lot of repetition in the input content of the template tasks or some instructions used to construct the dataset, which may affect the balance of the dataset. 2. Some n-grams phrases extracted from fixed sentences show convolution-like effects, such as \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d is segmented into 5-grams phrases such as \u201cquick brown fox jump over\u201d, \u201cjump over the lazy dog\u201d, etc. 44 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 n-grams count / prompts count how can we how can I can we use I want to what be some how can

n-grams comparison across datasets F.2 SYNTACTIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS In this section, we present the complete experimental data for all identified dependency types, along with their proportions in the datasets, as shown in Table 5. Additionally, Table 6 lists all detected Part-of-Speech tags and their corresponding proportions. Figure 8 further illustrates the ten most common verbs and their top five direct noun objects found in the prompt datasets except medical-o1 and ShareGPT, which are shown in the main paper. These additional data further support our conclusions. (1) The medical-o1 dataset, which consists of professionally crafted medical prompts, exhibits a relatively high proportion of numerical modifiers (nummod, 0.0276) and passive auxiliaries (auxpass, 0.0101) in dependency analysis, as well as a notably high usage of numerals (NUM, 0.0309) in POS tagging. These features reflect a terminology- dense and precision-oriented language style that emphasizes processes and outcomes rather than agents. (2) In the 1.1k-business dataset, the verb-noun pairs reflect language commonly used in business contexts, such as \u201ccreate plan\u201d and \u201ccreate strategy\u201d. In contrast, the verb-noun pairs observed in BoredHumans, OASST1, and Self-Instruct suggest more generic and broadly applicable usage scenarios. Anomalously, in the dolly-15k dataset, the most frequent verb-noun pairs exhibit a skewed distribution, with the highest-frequency nouns overwhelmingly associated with only the top one or two verbs. Moreover, these frequent verb-noun pairs often lack clear task-specific semantics\u2014for example, \u201ctell i\u201d, \u201cgive list\u201d, and \u201cclassify each\u201d. This pattern may be attributed to the manual generation process, which is susceptible to the individual linguistic habits of annotators. F.3 SEMANTIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS In this section, we show the distribution of sampled embedding points after PCA for all datasets (except for medical-o1 and Self-Instruct, which are shown in the main paper) in", "may be attributed to the manual generation process, which is susceptible to the individual linguistic habits of annotators. F.3 SEMANTIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS In this section, we show the distribution of sampled embedding points after PCA for all datasets (except for medical-o1 and Self-Instruct, which are shown in the main paper) in Figure 9. We can still observe from the results that datasets with more concentrated topical focus (e.g., 1.1k- business) exhibit clear clustering patterns, whereas those with broader thematic coverage (e.g., ShareGPT) display a more dispersed distribution of data points. 46 create use increase develop improve identify provide optimize have include content plan strategy campaign persona analysis medium marketing strategy language tra\ufb03c engagement rate visibility sale strategy plan persona series calendar rate e\ufb00ectiveness ranking performance experience area in\ufb02uencer customer audience point tip list insight datum recommendation content page website email experience trouble experience understanding type blog call insight messaging topic demographics (a) 1.1k-business use provide write create make give have suggest \ufb01nd include input service medium they knowledge you information explanation list i explanation post article script code list plan sense persona content purchase persona move decision statement name example message letter advice conversation piece understanding question dataset strategy improvement resource way recipe keyword solution \ufb02ashlight item question information keyword hashtag history name (b) BoredHumans tell give classify extract write list name use make have i story name point way list summary idea example way each following city item these name list year date type story paragraph letter email poem they result point some name some team book movie city bullet format text passage example list that what money co\ufb00ee day child that money sibling (c) dolly-15k write give provide explain use have make create describe get story program script code essay example list idea summary tip example i list you explanation di\ufb00erence concept it i process it that \ufb00mpeg word python idea access trouble impact that sense decision list it guide script program list plan character process place it di\ufb00erence way job it one error number (d) OASST1 write give \ufb01nd output use contain create have make get function essay letter program output example list output set reason number word sum sentence output index name number they category word it output letter python word number letter information any program list algorithm function output day meaning output list lot list money sentence change story job ait output discount (e) Self-Instruct Figure 8: The top-10 most common verbs and their top-5 direct noun objects in prompt datasets. 47 Table 5: All detected dependency types, with the values indicating their proportions in the dataset. \u2018-\u2019 means the Dependency Type not detected in the dataset.

For each case, we include the prompts used both before and after optimization, as well as the responses generated by the language model for each version. The two questions are selected from PRM800K (Lightman et al., 2023) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024c) # Seating Problem > Source: OpenAI/PRM800K ## Original Prompt In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side? (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.) ## Optimized Prompt How many different ways can we arrange 8 people around a square table, with 2 people seated on each side? Remember, two arrangements are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the table. ## Answer of Original Prompt To solve the problem of seating 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, where configurations that can be obtained by rotation are considered equivalent, we can follow these steps: 1. **Identify the arrangement of people around the table:** The square table has 4 sides and 2 seats on each side, resulting in a total of 8 seats. We need to count the distinct ways to arrange 8 people in these 8 seats. 2. **Consider the rotational symmetry:** Since configurations that can be obtained by rotating the arrangement are considered the same, we need to divide the total arrangements by the number of unique rotations. 3. **Fix one person to eliminate equivalency due to rotations:** We can fix one person in one of the seats to simplify our calculations. Fixing one person creates a reference point and allows us to treat the remaining arrangements as linear (ignoring the rotational symmetry now). 4. **Arrange the remaining people:** With one person fixed, there are 7 remaining people who can fill the other 7 seats. The number of ways to arrange 7 people is given by \\(7!\\): \\[ 7! = 5040 \\] 5. **Result:** Since fixing one person effectively removes any ambiguity due to rotations, we do not need to divide by the", "there are 7 remaining people who can fill the other 7 seats. The number of ways to arrange 7 people is given by \\(7!\\): \\[ 7! = 5040 \\] 5. **Result:** Since fixing one person effectively removes any ambiguity due to rotations, we do not need to divide by the number of rotations ( which was initially 4 for a square). Thus, the total number of distinct arrangements of 8 people around the table is simply \\(7!\\). In conclusion, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotations as equivalent, is: 50 \\[ \\boxed{5040} \\] ## Answer of Optimized Prompt To find the number of different ways to arrange 8 people around a square table with 2 people seated on each side, we need to consider the following steps: 1. **Total Arrangements without Considering Rotations**: First, we calculate the total arrangements of the 8 people without any restrictions on rotations. For 8 people, the total number of arrangements is given by the factorial of the number of people: \\[ 8! = 40320 \\] 2. **Considering Rotations**: Since the table can be rotated, we need to account for these symmetries. The table can be rotated in 4 ways (0, 90, 180, and 270). Therefore, we need to divide the total arrangements by the number of rotations: \\[ \\text{Distinct arrangements} = \\frac{8!}{4} \\] Substituting the value we calculated for \\(8!\\): \\[ \\text{Distinct arrangements} = \\frac{40320}{4} = 10080 \\] Thus, there are \\(10080\\) different ways to arrange 8 people around a square table with 2 people seated on each side where arrangements that can be obtained from each other through rotation are considered identical. The final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{10080} \\] # Swimming Mechanism > Source: TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro ## Original Prompt: What is the major difference between themethodof swimming in a fish such as a tuna, and that of a dolphin? Options: { \"A\": \"Both use side to side tail fin movement for swimming\", \"B\": \"Both species swim using rapid oscillation of their dorsal fins.\", \"C\": \"Tuna use their gills for propulsion while dolphins use their blowhole to aid in swimming.\", \"D\": \"Tuna swim by contracting their bodies and pushing water backwards, while dolphins swim primarily by using their pectoral fins.\", \"E\": \"Dolphins have a flexible backbone that allows for up-and-down movement, while tuna do not have a backbone.\", \"F\": \"Dolphins swim by rotating their entire body in a spiral motion, while tuna swim by flapping their fins only.\", \"G\": \"Tuna propel themselves using jet propulsion by expelling water, whereas dolphins glide through the water without any propulsion.\", \"H\": \"Dolphins use their hind limbs for swimming\", 51 \"I\": \"In tuna, the tail fin is oriented dorso-ventrally and movement is side to side, while in dolphins, the tail fin is oriented laterally with dorso-ventral movement. Dolphins also have vestigial hind limbs and modified forelimbs for balance, unlike tuna.\", \"J\": \"Tuna have modified forelimbs for balance\" } ## Optimized Prompt What is the key difference in how a tuna swims compared to a dolphin? Options: { \"A\":", "the tail fin is oriented laterally with dorso-ventral movement. Dolphins also have vestigial hind limbs and modified forelimbs for balance, unlike tuna.\", \"J\": \"Tuna have modified forelimbs for balance\" } ## Optimized Prompt What is the key difference in how a tuna swims compared to a dolphin? Options: { \"A\": \"Both use side-to-side tail fin movements to swim.\", \"B\": \"Both species utilize rapid oscillations of their dorsal fins for swimming.\", \"C\": \"Tuna propel themselves using their gills, while dolphins rely on their blowhole to assist in swimming.\", \"D\": \"Tuna swim by contracting their bodies and pushing water backward, whereas dolphins primarily use their pectoral fins for movement.\", \"E\": \"Dolphins have a flexible backbone that allows for up-and-down movement, unlike tuna which lack this flexibility.\", \"F\": \"Dolphins swim by rotating their entire bodies in a spiral motion, while tuna mainly flap their fins.\", \"G\": \"Tuna use jet propulsion by expelling water, while dolphins glide smoothly through the water.\", \"H\": \"Dolphins swim using their hind limbs.\", \"I\": \"In tuna, the tail fin is oriented dorso-ventrally and moves side to side, while in dolphins, the tail fin is oriented laterally and moves up and down. Additionally, dolphins have vestigial hind limbs and modified forelimbs for balance, which tuna do not.\", \"J\": \"Tuna have modified forelimbs for balance.\" } ## Answer of Original Prompt The major difference between the swimming methods of a fish such as a tuna and a dolphin can be best captured by option: **D: \"Tuna swim by contracting their bodies and pushing water backwards, while dolphins swim primarily by using their pectoral fins.\"** This option accurately describes the fundamental difference in their swimming mechanics, as tuna are fish that primarily use the lateral movement of their tails (caudal fins) and body contractions to move through the water, while dolphins, being mammals, utilize their pectoral fins along with the up-and-down movement of their tail ( fluke) to propel themselves. ## Answer of Optimized Prompt The key difference in how a tuna swims compared to a dolphin is best expressed by option: **I**: \"In tuna, the tail fin is oriented dorso-ventrally and moves side to side, while in dolphins, the tail fin is oriented laterally and moves up and down. Additionally, dolphins have vestigial hind limbs and modified forelimbs for balance, which tuna do not.\" This option correctly describes the anatomical differences in tail fin structure and swimming mechanics between the two species. 52", "FLRC: Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor for Efficient LLM Inference Yu-Chen Lu1,2, Chong-Yan Chen1, Chi-Chih Chang3, Yu-Fang Hu1, Kai-Chiang Wu1 1National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 2Macronix International Co., Ltd., 3Cornell University Correspondence: yuchen.cs11@nycu.edu.tw Abstract Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enor- mous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank com- pression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and pre- vious methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine- grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank alloca- tion for each layer, and incorporates progres- sive low-rank decoding to maintain text gener- ation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superior- ity of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improve- ment in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compres- sion methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference. 1 Introduction In recent years, large language models (LLM) (Zhang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a) have achieved re- markable progress in text understanding and gen- eration, finding widespread applications in areas ranging from customer service to data analysis. However, the substantial parameter counts and high computational demands of these models pose significant challenges for deployment in resource- constrained environments such as mobile devices and edge servers. To address these challenges, various model com- pression techniques have been proposed to reduce the computational and memory requirements of LLM while maintaining performance. Notable methods include model pruning (Ma et al., 2023; Akhauri et al., 2024) and quantization (Shao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). Among these, low-rank token0 token1 Low-rank model token1 token2 Low-rank model token2 token3 Low-rank model token3 token4 Low-rank model token4 token5 Low-rank model token5 token6 Low-rank model 80% activated ranks token0 token1 Low-rank model token1 token2 Low-rank model token2 token3 Low-rank model token3 token4 Low-rank model token4 token5 Low-rank model token5 token6 Low-rank model 80% activated ranks 70% activated ranks 60% activated ranks Traditional Low-rank Flow Fine-grained Low-rank Flow rn r1 r0 rn r1 r0 Static Low-rank Decoding Progressive Low-rank Decoding Uniform Rank Allocation Layer-wise Rank Allocation Figure 1: The differences between FLRC and traditional low-rank compression. As shown on the left side of the figure, we can determine the optimal number of ranks to preserve for each layer. On the right side, during the decoding stage, our approach gradually reduces the model\u2019s overall activated rank as more tokens are gener- ated, unlike previous static methods, thereby decreasing the parameter usage and computational requirements while maintaining the quality of the generated output. compression methods based on singular value de- composition (SVD) (Yuan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) have shown particular promise in reducing both model size and computational cost. Despite their potential, low-rank compression methods face several challenges that must be ad- dressed. First, each layer (and even each projec- tion) has its own tolerance for compression (c.f. Appendix A). Previous studies (Lin et al.,", "al., 2024) have shown particular promise in reducing both model size and computational cost. Despite their potential, low-rank compression methods face several challenges that must be ad- dressed. First, each layer (and even each projec- tion) has its own tolerance for compression (c.f. Appendix A). Previous studies (Lin et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024) have attempted to assign different, optimal compression rates to each component, but these methods are often time- consuming or insufficiently precise. Another sig- nificant issue is that prior work primarily evalu- ates compressed models on prefill-centric bench- marks, such as perplexity or common-sense reason- ing tasks, which are limited to single-token genera- arXiv:2510.09332v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 tion. Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art SVD-based methods suffer from notable accuracy degradation on tasks that require multiple decoding iterations, such as text summarization. As shown in Figure 1, we propose Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC) to overcome cur- rent limitations. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we develop an efficient, gradient-based rank allocation algorithm that is sig- nificantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. Second, we implement a dynamic low- rank compression paradigm that adjusts the rank allocation during each token generation, starting with a conservative compression rate and progres- sively increasing it to maintain high accuracy at the same overall compression ratio. Experimental results on popular LLaMA model families further validate our approach. In our ex- periments, our rank allocation algorithm reduces search time by up to 49\u00d7 compared to previous methods, and FLRC achieves up to a 17.35% higher ROUGE-L score on summarization benchmarks, setting a new standard for efficient and accurate model compression. 2 Related Works Low-rank compression (Kaushal et al., 2023; Hsu et al., 2022) has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing both parameter counts and computational overhead in neural networks. ASVD (Yuan et al., 2023) mitigates the impact of outlier activations by scaling weight matrices based on activation distri- bution. Additionally, it introduces a rank allocation strategy to assign appropriate parameters ratio to each layer. However, this search method is ex- tremely time-consuming. In contrast, our proposed rank search significantly reduces search time and, under high compression rates, finds rank allocation that deliver superior performance. Another related work, SVD-LLM (Wang et al., 2024), introduces a truncation-aware data whiten- ing method to better correlate singular values with compression errors, allowing the truncation of smaller singular values with minimal impact on error. However, despite these improvements, many low-rank compression methods still perform sub- optimally during the decoding phase of LLM in- ference. To overcome this limitation, we propose progressive low-rank decoding, which maintains high text generation quality even under aggressive compression, thereby improving the practicality of compressed LLM in real-world generation tasks.

A uni- form compression ratio across all layers can thus be suboptimal, as it may overcompress some compo- nents while undercompressing others. To address this issue, we propose the Fisher-based Layer-wise Rank Allocation algorithm, which computes an op- timal rank allocation for each projection, preserv- ing crucial projection ranks while effectively re- ducing overall model size. An overview of our algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. Our method begins by passing a calibration dataset D through the model M and computing the gradients via backward propagation. Let L de- note the set of all layers in the model, and for each layer l \u2208L, let Pl be the set of projections in that layer. For each layer l \u2208L and each projection p \u2208Pl, we denote the corresponding weight vector as Wl,p and its gradient as Gl,p. We then calculate a fisher-based (Abdelfattah et al., 2021) importance value \u03b1l,p, defined as: \u03b1l,p = X i \u0010 Gl,p[i] \u00d7 Wl,p[i] \u00112 , (1) which measures the sensitivity of each projection by incorporating both the gradient and the weight values. Higher \u03b1l,p values indicate that the pro- jection is more critical and should be compressed less aggressively (or potentially left uncompressed), whereas lower values suggest that the projection can tolerate more aggressive compression. For further details on Equation 1, please refer to Ap- pendix B. After computing the importance values for all projections, we sum them to obtain the total im- portance score S. We then allocate the rank for each projection proportionally to its importance by setting: rl,p = round \u0010\u03b1l,p S \u00d7 Rbudget \u0011 , (2) where Rbudget is the overall rank budget target, ad- justable based on the desired level of overall pa- rameter compression. This yields a layer-wise rank allocation {rl,p | l \u2208L, p \u2208Pl} that specifies the number of ranks retained for each projection in each layer, reflecting their relative importance. This adaptive strategy ensures that the available compression budget is efficiently distributed across the model, focusing more resources on the most impactful components. As a result, our rank allo- cation method achieves a better balance between compression and performance compared to", "each projection in each layer, reflecting their relative importance. This adaptive strategy ensures that the available compression budget is efficiently distributed across the model, focusing more resources on the most impactful components. As a result, our rank allo- cation method achieves a better balance between compression and performance compared to meth- ods that apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers. 3.2 Progressive Low-rank Decoding In text generation tasks, earlier tokens play a more significant role in shaping the overall coherence and quality of the output compared to later tokens (c.f. Appendix D). Thus, we propose Progressive Low-rank Decoding, a dynamic compression strat- egy that gradually reduces the model\u2019s overall acti- vated ranks during decoding. As shown in Figure 1, our method progressively decreases the rank as more tokens are generated, increasing the overall compression rate while preserving strong perfor- mance in generation phase. To adapt the rank allocation during decoding, we design a scheduler that determines the over- all rank budget Rbudget to be used for each token. Our scheduler leverages a calibration dataset to identify the optimal schedule based on different target compression levels. Let Rbudget(t) denote the rank budget for token t as determined by the scheduler. Note that Rbudget(t) is non-increasing, meaning that while consecutive tokens may share the same budget, the budget for token t + 1 will never exceed that for token t. Substituting Rbudget(t) for Rbudget in Equation 2 yields the token-specific rank configuration: rl,p(t) = round \u0010\u03b1l,p S \u00d7 Rbudget(t) \u0011 . (3) This yields the configuration {rl,p(t) | l \u2208L, p \u2208 Pl} for the current token. This scheduler-based approach dynamically ad- justs the rank budget during decoding: early tokens benefit from a larger parameter set, while later to- kens are generated with a reduced rank configu- ration. For supplementary details on our method, please refer to Appendix C. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experiments Setup For the decoding stage evaluation, we conduct ex- periments on two summarization benchmarks: Di- alogSum (Chen et al., 2021) and CNN/DM (Her- mann et al., 2015). In addition, to assess per- formance during the prefilling stage, we measure the perplexity on the Wikitext2 (Merity et al., 2016) dataset and evaluate zero-shot accuracy across seven common tasks provided in the LM- Evaluation-Harness (Gao et al., 2021). For experi- mental details, please refer to the Appendix F. 4.2 Evaluation on Generation Tasks As shown in Table 1, our experiments on Llama-3- 8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) reveal that previ- ous low-rank compression methods struggle with generation tasks. In contrast, our approach, which incorporates progressive low-rank decoding, con- sistently maintains strong performance across var- ious compression ratios. Here, the compression rate represents the overall percentage of parame- ter usage saved during the entire generation stage. Notably, under a 20% compression rate1, evalua- tions on the DialogSum benchmark indicate that while competing methods yield ROUGE-L scores 1We define the compression rate as the average percentage reduction in model parameters per token, computed over both the prefilling and decoding stages.

Although earlier low-rank compression tech- niques have shown relatively better performance on Llama-2-7B-Chat, our method still delivers sig- nificantly higher ROUGE-L and BertScore met- rics at high compression rates across both bench- marks. An ablation study of our proposed approach is presented in Appendix E. We also evaluated our method on different model sizes to demonstrate its generalization; see Appendix H for details. 4.3 Evaluation on Understanding Tasks In addition to generation tasks, we evaluate our ap- proach on perplexity and zero-shot accuracy using Llama-3-8B, as shown in Table 2. On the Wikitext2 dataset, our method achieves significantly lower perplexity compared to other low-rank compres- sion techniques. Moreover, the average zero-shot accuracy across various compression ratios consis- tently outperforms that of previous methods. These results indicate that our proposed layer-wise rank allocation effectively mitigates the performance loss typically associated with model compression, ensuring robust language understanding even under aggressive parameter reduction. 4.4 Rank Allocation Search Time We compare our proposed rank allocation search with the ASVD approach. The ASVD method, be- ing perplexity-based, requires substantially more time for the search process compared to our ap- proach. On an A100 GPU, the ASVD method takes approximately 147 minutes to complete the search, whereas our method requires only 3 min- utes, representing a 49-fold improvement in speed. This significant reduction in search time demon- strates that our approach can quickly and efficiently determine an optimal rank configuration for the model, thereby facilitating faster deployment. For additional performance comparison experiments, please refer to Appendix G. 5 Conclusion In this study, we propose", "representing a 49-fold improvement in speed. This significant reduction in search time demon- strates that our approach can quickly and efficiently determine an optimal rank configuration for the model, thereby facilitating faster deployment. For additional performance comparison experiments, please refer to Appendix G. 5 Conclusion In this study, we propose the Fine-grained Low- Rank Compressor (FLRC) to rapidly determine the optimal compression ratio for each layer, thereby mitigating the performance degradation that arises from applying a uniform compression rate across all layers. Additionally, we introduce progressive low-rank decoding to address the poor performance of existing low-rank compression methods during the generation phase. Experimental results demon- strate that, under the same parameter utilization, our approach outperforms other methods on both generation and understanding tasks, indicating a significant performance improvement in low-rank compression. Limitation In this study, we rely on a calibration dataset to perform layer-wise rank allocation and design the scheduler for FLRC. However, the model\u2019s perfor- mance on different benchmarks may vary depend- ing on the choice of calibration dataset, which can lead to discrepancies. To ensure fairness, we use the same calibration dataset for all methods in our experiments. Additionally, our experimental results show that dynamically specifying the number of model pa- rameters used per token can greatly enhance LLM inference efficiency. Nevertheless, optimizing the scheduler for dynamic rank allocation remains a crucial challenge, as it may introduce additional overhead. Consequently, our future work will fo- cus on engineering optimizations and kernel design, specifically reducing the overhead associated with dynamic rank allocation, to further improve the overall efficiency of our approach.

A Importance Score of Different Layers Different layers within a model often exhibit vary- ing degrees of \u201ccompressibility\u201d, implying that uni- form compression ratio can lead to suboptimal re- sults. We can calculate the importance score of each component in the model based on our pro- posed method. As shown in Figure 2, the impor- tance score of the projection in each layer varies significantly. Identifying which layers can toler- ate more aggressive compression and which layers require a more careful approach is crucial to maxi- mizing efficiency while minimizing performance degradation. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 Layer Index 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Importance Score Importance of Llama-3-8B Proj q_proj k_proj v_proj o_proj gate_proj up_proj down_proj Figure 2: The importance score of various projections in Llama-3-8B across different layer indices. Each point represents a projection\u2019s score; higher scores (e.g., \"down_proj\") indicate that less compression should be applied, while lower scores allow for more aggressive compression. B Sensitivity Metrics for Each Projection We use a small calibration dataset and perform back propagation to compute the gradient for each pro- jection. We observed that parameters with larger gradients tend to be more sensitive, and that larger weight values typically indicate higher importance.

In addition to Equation 1, we evaluated two al- ternative metrics. First, we considered only the weight magnitudes: \u03b1l,p = X i \u0010 Wl,p[i] \u00112 , (4) and second, we considered only the gradient val- ues: \u03b1l,p = X i \u0010 Gl,p[i] \u00112 . (5) Using each metric, we computed the importance of every projection and performed rank allocation ac- cordingly. Table 3 presents generative performance comparison on Llama-3-8B-Instruct. It is clear that the metric combining both gradient and weight magnitudes is the most accurate. Consequently, we adopt Equation 1 as our chosen method for estimat- ing the importance of projection. C Supplementary Details on Progressive Low-Rank Decoding Increasing the compression rate gradually during the generation phase is highly compatible with low- rank compression. After decomposing each projec- tion\u2019s parameter matrix into two smaller matrices using singular value decomposition, the channels in these matrices are automatically ordered by im- portance. In other words, rows or columns at lower indices contain the most critical information, while those at higher indices can be safely truncated. This allows us to dynamically decide, at each token generation step, how many of the top k rows or columns to retain, where a smaller k corresponds to a higher compression rate. This inherent prop- erty makes our approach ideally suited for dynamic Method DialogSum ROUGE-L \u2191 Static rank decoding 14.71 Increased rank decoding 8.59 Decreased rank decoding 19.87 Table 4: Comparison of different dynamic rank decod- ing methods on Llama-3-8B-Instruct (ROUGE-L is ex- pressed as percentages). rank allocation, leading to an efficient implementa- tion of progressive low-rank decoding, as we only need to decrement k during token generation. Although dynamic rank adjustment introduces some overhead, when the savings in computation and data transfer are substantial, the overhead of dynamically changing the rank becomes negligible. Moreover, users can also evaluate what level of performance degradation is acceptable in exchange for the corresponding acceleration, as this will vary depending on the specific use case. In our work, the term \u201cschedule\u201d refers to the points during the generation process at which the LLM switches to a higher compression rate. This means we can generate many schedule candidates, each corresponding to an overall compression rate (i.e., the average compression rate used for every token), which we denote as the overall rank budget (Rbudget). We then use a calibration dataset to evalu- ate the performance of each schedule (using metrics like BERTScore), ultimately selecting the sched- ule that best meets our desired overall rank budget Rbudget while achieving optimal performance for running our FLRC. D Progressive Low-rank Decoding Forms In this study, we propose dynamically adjusting the number of ranks used for each generated", "performance of each schedule (using metrics like BERTScore), ultimately selecting the sched- ule that best meets our desired overall rank budget Rbudget while achieving optimal performance for running our FLRC. D Progressive Low-rank Decoding Forms In this study, we propose dynamically adjusting the number of ranks used for each generated token, and we compare three approaches for doing so. The first approach, Static Rank Decoding, applies a fixed rank for every token. The second, Increased Rank Decoding, uses fewer ranks for early tokens and more for later ones. The third, Decreased Rank Decoding, assigns more ranks to early tokens and fewer to later tokens. In Table 4, we compare these methods on the DialogSum summarization task, ensuring that each approach uses the same average number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that Decreased Rank Decoding achieves superior per- formance, which is why we adopt it as our method for Progressive Low-Rank Decoding.

E Ablation Study Our proposed Fine-grained Low-Rank Compres- sor consists of two key components: Fisher-based Layer-wise Rank Allocation (FLRA) and Progres- sive Low-Rank Decoding (PLRD). To quantify the impact of each component, we conducted an abla- tion study on Llama-3-8B-Instruct with a 20% com- pression rate, measuring generative performance. As shown in Table 5, SVD-LLM alone delivers poor results. In contrast, applying either our FLRA or PLRD individually yields substantial gains in generation quality. These findings demonstrate that both components of our method effectively enhance the performance of low-rank compressed models. F Experimental Details Our used datasets and base models were sourced from the HuggingFace (Lhoest et al., 2021) and Transformers (Wolf, 2020) libraries, and all us- age complied with the respective terms and condi- tions. For evaluating zero-shot accuracy, we em- ployed seven common tasks: ARC-Easy, ARC- Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2019), MathQA (Amini et al., 2019) and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). For summarization tasks, we used ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and BertScore (Zhang et al., 2019) as evalu- ation metrics. For the FLRC layer-wise rank allocation, we sampled 256 sequences (each with a length of 2048) from the Wikitext2 training set as our cali- bration dataset, while the scheduler\u2019s calibration dataset was drawn from 500 samples from the Di- alogSum training set. For perplexity evaluation, the input sequence length was set to 2048. The compression rate is computed by first establishing a baseline based on the number of parameters in the q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj, gate_proj, up_proj, and down_proj matrices of the LLaMA model, and then determining the percentage of pa- rameters omitted during each inference. Our experimental pipeline follows the SVD- LLM procedure. First, the model weights are decomposed using SVD-LLM\u2019s truncation-aware data whitening method, after which we apply our proposed layer-wise rank allocation and progres- sive low-rank", "matrices of the LLaMA model, and then determining the percentage of pa- rameters omitted during each inference. Our experimental pipeline follows the SVD- LLM procedure. First, the model weights are decomposed using SVD-LLM\u2019s truncation-aware data whitening method, after which we apply our proposed layer-wise rank allocation and progres- sive low-rank decoding modules. Notably, since our compression strategy is orthogonal to PEFT fine-tuning, we deliberately omit the weight up- dating steps typically included in the SVD-LLM framework. This design choice was made to ensure a fair comparison with SVD-LLM. G Rank Allocation Method Comparison In order to compare our rank allocation method with ASVD\u2019s, we first whiten the model weights and then apply different rank allocation strategies. We evaluate the resulting models on Wikitext2 by measuring perplexity. As shown in Table 6, under the same compression rate, our method achieves lower perplexity, demonstrating that our approach not only speeds up the search process but also finds a more optimal rank allocation for the compressed model.

The rank allocation method we employ is both fast (as detailed in Section 4.4) and yields supe- rior results. Unlike techniques that rely on iterative updates (such as Bayesian Optimization (Ji et al., 2024)) or memory-intensive and slow Hessian- based methods (Shao et al., 2024), our approach avoids these drawbacks. Previous works (Lin et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024) have proposed estimating the im- portance of various model components; however, these approaches are often inefficient or inaccurate and unsuitable for our method. MoDeGPT (Lin et al., 2024) evaluates the importance of different blocks (or layers) using block influence, which re- quires the input and output dimensions to be the same.

Bolaco (Ji et al., 2024) uses Bayesian optimization for rank allocation, which requires multiple itera- tions to converge. Our approach, on the other hand, only needs a single iteration, making it significantly more efficient. PrunerGPT (Shao et al., 2024) uses a Hessian-based approach to identify the impor- tance of each component, which consumes substan- tial memory and computation time. As a result, these methods are less efficient than our proposed method. We integrated the allocation methods from prior works with our progressive low-rank decoding and conducted a generative performance comparison. As shown in Table 7, our fisher-based rank alloca- tion outperforms the other methods and remains highly efficient. H Evaluation on Models of Different Sizes We evaluated our method on 3B and 13B models to demonstrate its generalization capability.

H Evaluation on Models of Different Sizes We evaluated our method on 3B and 13B models to demonstrate its generalization capability. Table 8 clearly shows that FLRC continues to outperform SVD-LLM by a significant margin. The results demonstrate that, although SVD-LLM experiences a significant performance drop, FLRC substantially mitigates the performance degradation at the same compression rate. We also conducted a zero-shot evaluation on the Llama-2-13B model. As shown in Table 9, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse tasks at the same compression rate, highlighting the superiority of FLRC efficacy in preserving models performance. We further evaluated our approach on the Llama- 30B model (i.e., models exceeding 20B param- eters), as presented in Table 10.

More- over, we observe that our technique achieves even greater compression efficiency on larger models, yielding a smaller accuracy drop. I Speedup of End-to-end Decoding We conducted practical speedup experiments on our method. Table 11 is our current acceleration result using the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model with a batch size of 512, a sequence length of 32, and 128 tokens generated. These results still show a tangible speedup. Typically, benchmarks for such work increase the batch size to make the model compute-bound and achieve higher throughput. However, we believe that our proposed progres- sive low-rank decoding is particularly effective for alleviating memory-bound issues as well as situa- tions characterized by low throughput. To further validate this, we conducted an additional experi- ment under offloading conditions. In this setup, us- ing the same Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, our GPU is limited to approximately 8GB of VRAM; hence, the remaining parameter matrices are offloaded to host DRAM and transferred to GPU VRAM when needed for computation. The experimental settings in this case are: a batch size of 1, sequence length of 32, and generating 128 tokens. Table 12 is our experimental result for offloading. Our ap- proach alleviates the memory transfer requirements, thereby accelerating the overall process. Our re- sults clearly demonstrate that our method yields even more significant acceleration when the system is memory-bound. Additionally, in data transfers, larger data tend to experience increased fragmenta- tion compared to smaller ones. This fragmentation means that the data is divided into more segments or fragments, and each fragment often incurs its own processing overhead. Therefore, in strongly memory-bound situations, FLRC may deliver even better acceleration than theoretically predicted. Comp.

As models grow larger and context windows increase, GPU VRAM demand will rise, making offloading scenarios increasingly common for sin- gle user and edge device. Under these conditions, the model\u2019s inherent throughput can become very low. Therefore, FLRC is particularly beneficial in environments that require model offloading. J FLRC on Low-precision Model We conducted our experiments primarily in FP16 precision. As shown in Table 13, our method re- mains equally effective at lower precisions. We evaluated generation task on both Llama-3-8B- Instruct and Llama-2-7B-Chat models using our approach. The results demonstrate that there is no drop in accuracy across various compression rates, even when using lower-precision models.

K Sensitivity Analysis to Calibration Datasets Most existing SVD-based methods rely on calibra- tion datasets. Table 14 shows experimental results obtained by calibrating on different datasets for compressing Llama-3.2-3B. Notably, when cali- brated on Wikitext2, the model exhibits improved perplexity on Wikitext2 but performs worse on C4; conversely, calibration on C4 yields better results on C4 but poorer performance on Wikitext2. This behavior is expected, as models tend to perform bet- ter on data that closely resembles the calibration set. Importantly, our results indicate that FLRC consis- tently achieves lower perplexity than SVD-LLM across different calibration datasets. Therefore, as long as all compared methods are calibrated using the same dataset, the experiments remain fair. In all our experiments, FLRC and the previous methods (ASVD, SVD-LLM) have been calibrated on the identical dataset. Method Comp.

Therefore, numer- ous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative frame- work for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. After- wards, it leverages the LLMs\u2019 nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs\u2019 domain reasoning over retrieved prod- ucts, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions.

Unlike business-to-consumer (B2C) e- commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Walmart), C2C platforms (e.g., Mercari, eBay, Xianyu) cater to individual sellers, featuring a wide array of highly diverse and personalized second-hand products. Due to a lack of experience and awareness of dynamic market conditions, they face unique challenges in making pricing decisions during the product listing process [38]. These issues not only affect listing efficiency but also influence transaction success rates. To address these issues, it is imperative to simplify the pricing process for individual users. By harnessing the extensive product data available on second-hand e-commerce platforms could auto- matically generate high-quality pricing suggestions. As shown in Figure 1, individual sellers can adopt the price with a single click 1Xianyu is China\u2019s largest second-hand e-commerce platform. arXiv:2510.09347v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Wang et al. Manual Product Pricing Intelligent Product Pricing Figure 1: Intelligent Product Pricing on C2C Platforms. or adjust it as needed. By eliminating the manual price entry re- quirement, it can help them make price decisions efficiently and accurately. Leading C2C e-commerce platforms have increasingly explored automated price estimation for second-hand products [13\u201315, 38]. Early works [38, 40, 41] employ traditional machine learning al- gorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and decision trees, to perform category-specific price prediction. Subsequent studies [13, 15, 26, 42, 52] shift towards regression models that predict prices from learned product representations, and progressively ex- tend to more categories. In a practical industrial setting, Xianyu has deployed a pricing system based on Category Property Value (CPV) identification [39], which improves the accuracy of price estimation. The system first assigns each newly listing product to a pre-computed cluster according to identified CPV. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is then applied within the corresponding cluster for price estimation, as shown in Figure 2. Although effec- tive in certain tasks, existing approaches still face challenges in the context of second-hand e-commerce, primarily due to two reasons: Difficulty in Understanding Fine-Grained Product Infor- mation: Unlike brand-new products on B2C platforms, second- hand products exhibit greater diversity and uniqueness due to their complex attributes and varied conditions. Moreover, the colloquial product descriptions from individual sellers compound the chal- lenge for regression models in understanding textual nuances. For example, the price of an iPhone 16 is heavily dependent on its battery health (e.g. 90% vs. 70%). However, previous models with limited representational capacity struggle to understand this crucial pricing information. Even structured CPV-based approach often overlooks key attributes like battery health, thereby compromising pricing accuracy. Limited Flexibility and Generalization: Driven by factors including new product launches,", "heavily dependent on its battery health (e.g. 90% vs. 70%). However, previous models with limited representational capacity struggle to understand this crucial pricing information. Even structured CPV-based approach often overlooks key attributes like battery health, thereby compromising pricing accuracy. Limited Flexibility and Generalization: Driven by factors including new product launches, supply-demand shifts, and market hype, the second-hand market is highly dynamic. For instance, the launch of iPhone 17 sharply reduces the resale value of previous- generation iPhone 16. Morever, different product categories often exhibit distinct attributes (e.g., battery health for phones vs. remain- ing volume for perfumes). Nevertheless, learning-based models that employ a unified feature space fail to account for such cross- category heterogeneity. Therefore, previous models with static pa- rameters cannot adapt to these changes, resulting in poor flexibility over time and generalization across product categories. These challenges highlight the significant hurdles to effectively making pricing decisions in C2C e-commerce platforms, raising a critical question: Can we develop a pricing system that understands fine-grained product descriptions and adapts to market dynamics to provide accurate price suggestions? Fortunately, second-hand e-commerce platforms contain a wealth of product data. The Law of One Price [7, 10, 19] in economics states that homogeneous products will trade at a uniform price in an ef- ficient market. In the context of second-hand e-commerce, this principle implies that products in similar conditions should have comparable prices. Thus, we can retrieve similar products in real time, offering pricing references and insights into market dynamics for target product. Furthermore, autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications [11, 24, 51]. Compared to previous methods, LLMs possess superior language understanding capabilities for unstruc- tured text. This allows them to precisely analyze critical pricing determinants from colloquial product descriptions during inference. Therefore, we can adopt a \"retrieval-then-reasoning\" paradigm, en- abling LLMs to generate both a price suggestion and its supporting rationale, which enhances reliability and interpretability of the generated result. To address the limitations of existing methods, this paper in- troduces the first LLM-based product Pricing system (LLP), aim- ing to improve the accuracy and reliability of price prediction for second-hand products. The system consists of two key steps: simi- lar product retrieval, followed by LLM-based reasoning for price estimation. First, we first construct a dynamic candidate product pool that reflects second-hand market conditions. From this pool, we retrieve relevant products in real-time, which serve as the basis for subsequent pricing decisions [1, 43, 48]. Second, we integrate the information of the listing product with the retrieved products into a prompt, leveraging the powerful language understanding of LLMs to generate price suggestion. To further enhance the rea- soning capabilities of LLMs over retrieved products [18, 20, 22, 45], we post-train them on a dataset constructed through bidirectional reasoning. The training process involves two-stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [5] to guide LLMs to explore more optimal reasoning trajec- tories. Finally, we evaluate the output quality of the LLMs based on the average entropy of generated prices [6, 8, 9, 23], which filters out", "The training process involves two-stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [5] to guide LLMs to explore more optimal reasoning trajec- tories.

LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY 2 Related Work With the proliferation of C2C flea markets, making price decisions for second-hand products has become a core challenge for individ- ual sellers. Numerous studies have sought to automate price pre- diction through algorithms to improve listing efficiency, a goal that closely aligns with our work. Early research focuses on traditional machine learning algorithms. For instance, eBay [38] develops an attribute-based price prediction system for laptop auctions using a feature-weighted KNN algorithm. Sun et al. [40] leverages extensive transaction data of the second-hand car to build and optimize back propagation (BP) neural network for price prediction. Similarly, within this category, Varshitha et al. [41] employ multiple regres- sion models to forecast used car prices based on key features such as year, mileage, and condition. However, these methods are category- specific and lack the versatility, difficult to generalize across the diverse range of product categories on e-commerce platform. Subsequent researchers shift to deep neural networks, encoding heterogeneous product attributes into unified, dense representa- tions to achieve more precise price estimation. Some studies [52, 52] predict property prices with visual features. Han et al. [13] design a price prediction model for second-hand products based on images uploaded by users. Mercari, a Japanese C2C platform, launches a price prediction challenge on Kaggle 2, aiming to provide price sug- gestions based on users\u2019 product descriptions. Unlike these methods rely solely on single-modal information, [14] and Han et al. [15] incorporate both visual and textual product features. More recently, Vedula et al. [42] propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs to produce price prediction distributions by en- coding unstructured text inputs. Xianyu\u2019s prior CPV-based pricing system (Figure 2) first identifies the CPV of target product using TACLR [39], then estimates its price via GMM over the cluster of products sharing the same CPVs. However, trained on specific data, both the regression models and CPV identification model suffer from poor flexibility and generalization. In contrast, LLP reframes price estimation as a generative task through a novel \"retrieval- then-reasoning\" paradigm, effectively addressing the limitations. 3 Preliminaries The task of estimating prices for second-hand products is supported by a vast, readily available database of relevant products. Our core hypothesis is that by leveraging this database as an auxiliary source of knowledge, we can improve the accuracy and reasonableness of price prediction. Mathematically, let M be a LLM, Q a set of products awaiting pricing, and BQ = {(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 a knowledge base of accessible", "products. Our core hypothesis is that by leveraging this database as an auxiliary source of knowledge, we can improve the accuracy and reasonableness of price prediction. Mathematically, let M be a LLM, Q a set of products awaiting pricing, and BQ = {(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 a knowledge base of accessible products, where \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56represents the details of a product (including images, textual description, and condition), \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is its corresponding price and and \ud835\udc41is the total number of products in BQ.

This process, denoted by T, aims to yield an optimized model M\u2032 that achieves a lower pricing error L than the original one. M\u2032 = T (M, BQ),\ud835\udc60.\ud835\udc61., LM\u2032 < LM (3) During the inference phase, to address output uncertainty of LLMs, we introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism.

LLP consists of two key modules: similar product retrieval (Section 4.2) and LLM-based reasoning for price estimation (Section 4.3). First, the retrieval module identifies a set of similar products from a pre-built candidate pool to serve as market references for the query product in real time. Then, the reasoning module leverages the robust understanding ability of LLMs to comprehensively analyze retrieved results and generate the final price suggestion. 4.2 Similar Products Retrieval As shown in stage 1 of Figure 2, LLP begins by retrieving similar items. Its implementation comprises three key components: (1) can- didate product pool construction, (2) offline product representation extraction, and (3) real-time online retrieval. 4.2.1 Candidate Product Pool Construction. We select second-hand products listed on the Xianyu e-commerce platform within the past \ud835\udc61days as our external knowledge base. To balance data recency and candidate diversity, here we set the time window \ud835\udc61to 90, ensuring that the knowledge base effectively reflects market dynamics. Pric- ing accuracy highly depends on the quality of retrieved products. Therefore, we filter out problematic listings, such as those engag- ing in off-platform solicitation, clickbait pricing, and counterfeit products, as they undermine pricing fairness. Specifically, we ana- lyze user interaction data and chat records, applying a rule-based filtering mechanism to remove these fraudulent listings. Further- more, we retain products whose click counts exceed \ud835\udc50% (e.g., c = 70) of the filtered products,", "off-platform solicitation, clickbait pricing, and counterfeit products, as they undermine pricing fairness. Specifically, we ana- lyze user interaction data and chat records, applying a rule-based filtering mechanism to remove these fraudulent listings. Further- more, we retain products whose click counts exceed \ud835\udc50% (e.g., c = 70) of the filtered products, focusing on high-engagement products while reducing long-tail noise. The resulting set constitutes our final candidate product pool. 4.2.2 Offline Product Representation Extraction. To efficiently re- trieve the most similar products from the candidate pool, we first extract a representation for each product. Semantic ID [33, 37, 54] encodes products into a coarse-to-fine hierarchical structure us- ing a compact, fixed vocabulary, facilitating knowledge transfer across similar products and ensuring robust generalization. Unlike Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Wang et al. Figure 2: The Product Pricing Frameworks: Evolving from CPV-based to LLM-based Approach contrastive learning approaches that depend on high-quality neg- ative samples, Semantic ID is trained end-to-end on raw product data, achieving superior semantic discrimination [16]. The Gener- ative Semantic ID (GSID) in Xianyu [50] employs a hierarchical tree structure that integrates multimodal features with collabora- tive signals, from which we extract the fourth-level embeddings as product representations. Given the poor standardization of list- ings by individual sellers, GSID offers more comprehensive depic- tions of products than those based solely on text or images. For all products in the candidate product pool BQ = {(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1, we extract their representations offline and build an index repository E = {\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 = {E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 , which is updated hourly. 4.2.3 Real-time Online Retrieval. For a newly listing product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, we encode it online using GSID, mapping it into the same repre- sentation space and obtaining the query vector \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e= E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e). The semantic relevance between the product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5eand a candidate product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56is then determined by computing the similarity of their embed- dings in real time: sim(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56) = E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e)\u22a4E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56) \u2225E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e) \u2225\u2225E(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56) \u2225. To enable efficient and concurrent computation, we employ Proxima 3, an approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) engine here. Finally, for the query product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, system returns the Top-\ud835\udc58most relevant second-hand products B\ud835\udc5e= {(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57)}\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc57=1 as price references for the subsequent reasoning process. 4.3 LLM-Based Reasoning for Price Estimation Building on the retrieved similar products, as shown in stage 2 of Fig- ure 2, we leverage LLM to generate price suggestions. The settings 3http://github.com/alibaba/proxima of prompt engineering are detailed in Section 4.3.1. Vanilla LLMs often underperform when applied directly, as they lack domain- specific knowledge and are easily misled by distractors in the re- trieved set. Therefore, we post-train the LLM using a specialized two-stage paradigm outlined in Algorithm 1. The first stage involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset constructed via bidirec- tional reasoning to inject essential domain knowledge (Section 4.3.2). In the second stage, we employ retrieval-aware preference optimization to align the model\u2019s generation process with the up- stream retrieval context (Section 4.3.3). Lastly, given the complexity and subjectivity inherent in second-hand product pricing, we intro- duce a confidence-based filtering strategy (Section 4.3.4) to balance precision and recall", "(Section 4.3.2). In the second stage, we employ retrieval-aware preference optimization to align the model\u2019s generation process with the up- stream retrieval context (Section 4.3.3). Lastly, given the complexity and subjectivity inherent in second-hand product pricing, we intro- duce a confidence-based filtering strategy (Section 4.3.4) to balance precision and recall in the last deployment. 4.3.1 Prompt Engineering. To address two critical challenges: (i) interference from irrelevant products in the retrieved set, and (ii) the inability of simple statistical methods to extract crucial pricing cues from colloquial product descriptions (e.g., \"two-year warranty\", \"one earbud missing\"), we leverage the robust text understanding of LLMs to generate accurate price suggestions. The prompt for the LLMs is structured around three core elements: (1) criteria for assessing product similarity, (2) a comprehensive description of the query product, and (3) details and market prices of the retrieved reference products. Full prompt templates are provided in Appendix A.4. The LLMs carefully analyze input context and then generate a price estimate \u02c6\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5ealong with its corresponding pricing rationale R. 4.3.2 Fine-Tuning with Bidirectional Reasoning-based Dataset. To construct a high-quality dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we propose an automated approach named bidirectional reasoning, LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY comprising two stages: backward and forward reasoning. Backward reasoning stage starts from the ground truth price of the query product to identify a subset of strictly similar products among the retrieved candidates. Subsequently, forward reasoning stage leverages this refined subset to guide LLMs, mitigating the influence of distractors and enabling the generation of a reliable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) rationale suitable for SFT. This two-stage process yields more refined and controllable outputs from LLMs. Specifically, in the backward reasoning stage, we first retrieve products similar to the input training sample product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e. The re- trieved set B\ud835\udc5einevitably contains irrelevant products that distract the LLMs from their reasoning. Therefore, given the ground truth price \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5eof \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, we prompt LLMs to identify a subset B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e\u2286B\ud835\udc5e consisting of products that are identical to \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5ewith same key at- tributes (e.g., brand, model and condition). We hypothesize that by anchoring the LLMs\u2019 analysis to this highly relevant subset, they can subsequently generate a more accurate and reasonable price estimate. This stage also functions as a rejection sampling step. An empty B\u2217 \ud835\udc5esuggests that the retrieved set B\ud835\udc5econtains no valid pricing evidence for the product \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, likely due to retrieval shortcomings or ambiguous product characteristics. Such a sample is excluded to ensure the quality and reliability of our training data. B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e= Mbackward(B\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e) (5) Building on the first phase, the second stage, forward reasoning, enables the LLMs to simulate the actual pricing process as a user. The prompt for each training sample provides a complete reasoning context by integrating: the query product (\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e), the initially retrieved candidate set B\ud835\udc5e, and the CoT generated in the backward reasoning stage, which explicitly incorporates the refined subset B\u2217 \ud835\udc5eof highly similar products. Starting from the details of the query product, the LLM focuses their analysis on B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e, thus generating a coherent", "query product (\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e), the initially retrieved candidate set B\ud835\udc5e, and the CoT generated in the backward reasoning stage, which explicitly incorporates the refined subset B\u2217 \ud835\udc5eof highly similar products. Starting from the details of the query product, the LLM focuses their analysis on B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e, thus generating a coherent pricing rationale R and the target price \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e. The prompt templates are provided in the appendix A.4. R, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e= Mforward(B\ud835\udc5e, B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e) (6) Vanilla LLMs lack domain understanding of retrieved products for second-hand product pricing generation. Moreover, irrelevant products in the retrieved set can mislead their reasoning, leading to biased predictions. To address these limitations, we fine-tune the LLMs on the constructed dataset, thereby enhancing their knowl- edge [3, 25, 30, 44, 44] and reasoning capability [4, 53]. In addition, to improve the adaptability of the LLMs to diverse scenarios, we introduce a hybrid training paradigm that augments each training sample with two distinct formats. Specifically, the first format is designed for latency-sensitive applications and formulated as a direct price prediction task. In this setting, the price serves as the only supervisory signal to improve price prediction accuracy. The second format targets applications where interpretability is para- mount. We use rationale R and price \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5efrom the forward reasoning stage as labels to train the same LLM. We employ a standard next- token prediction objective for this SFT process, formally defined as: L\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc47(\ud835\udf03) = \u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc57=1 log \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57|\ud835\udc4b,\ud835\udc661, ...,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\u22121;\ud835\udf03), where \ud835\udc4bdenotes the input context, \ud835\udc66represents the sequence of generated tokens and \ud835\udc47 is the total length. 4.3.3 Retrieval-aware Policy Optimization.

To address this, we turn to reinforcement learning, inspired by its recent success in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and code generation [5, 17, 18, 20, 22, 28, 45]. We adopt Group Relative Policy Optimiza- tion (GRPO) to further align the LLM\u2019s outputs", "reasoning skills, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we turn to reinforcement learning, inspired by its recent success in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and code generation [5, 17, 18, 20, 22, 28, 45]. We adopt Group Relative Policy Optimiza- tion (GRPO) to further align the LLM\u2019s outputs with the retrieval process. Guided by a rule-based feedback mechanism, GRPO guides LLMs toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories, fostering more robust and accurate price predictions. Our reward function is designed to jointly assess the accuracy of the predicted price and the coherence of the reasoning process. It comprises two components: an outcome-based reward and a process-based reward. The outcome-based reward measures the accuracy of the LLMs\u2019 price estimation. It assigns a higher reward to rationales that yield accurate price prediction \u02c6\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e, with the re- ward decreasing as the relative error between the predicted price \u02c6\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5eand ground-truth price \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5eincreases. However, relying solely on price accuracy is insufficient, as the LLM generations are prone to hallucination or under-utilization of the retrieved products. There- fore, the process-based component evaluates how well the model\u2019s reasoning is grounded in the provided evidence. It incentivizes the LLM to base its analysis on the golden subset B\u2217 \ud835\udc5eby measuring the recall of these items within the generated rationale. The final Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Wang et al. reward is the product of these two components: \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51= 1 1 + \ud835\udefc\u00b7 \u0010 \u02c6\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e\u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e \u00112 | {z } price accuracy \u00d7 |{ \u02c6B\u2217\ud835\udc5e} \u2229{B\u2217 \ud835\udc5e}| |{B\u2217\ud835\udc5e}| | {z } similar product recall (7) Following SFT, we further optimize the LLMs using GRPO. Specif- ically, for each product requiring a price estimate with its retrieved set B\ud835\udc5e, GRPO samples a group of outputs {\ud835\udc5c1,\ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc3a} from the old policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51. The policy model \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03is optimized by maximizing the following objective: \ud835\udc3dGRPO(\ud835\udf03) = E\ud835\udc65\u223cD,{\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc56=1\u223c\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03old (\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) \u0014 1 \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc3a \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \u0010 min \u0000\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udf03)\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56, clip(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udf03), 1 \u2212\ud835\udf16, 1 + \ud835\udf16)\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56 \u0001 \u2212\ud835\udefdD\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03||\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53) \u0011\u0015 (8) where the importance weight is \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc65) , \ud835\udf16and \ud835\udefdare hyper pa- rameters, and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56denotes the advantage computed from rewards {\ud835\udc5f1,\ud835\udc5f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a} corresponding to the outputs within the group. The last term is a KL divergence that penalizes an excessive deviation of the current policy from the reference model \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53. A practical challenge on second-hand e-commerce platforms is data homogeneity, often caused by sellers listing the same item across multiple accounts. This can lead to retrieved sets contain- ing near-duplicate products, causing the LLM to generate highly similar outputs. Consequently, the intra-group rewards for GRPO become uniform, diminishing the learning signal. To mitigate this issue, we employ a rejection sampling strategy [5]. Specifically, we employ the Jaro distance to measure textual similarity between product descriptions within each retrieved set. Samples exhibiting excessively high internal similarity are filtered out, ensuring that the model learns from a more diverse range of complex pricing scenarios. 4.3.4 Precision-Recall Balance Based on Confidence Level. Due to the subjectivity of individual sellers and variations in product condi- tion, LLMs often struggle to generate reliable", "set. Samples exhibiting excessively high internal similarity are filtered out, ensuring that the model learns from a more diverse range of complex pricing scenarios. 4.3.4 Precision-Recall Balance Based on Confidence Level. Due to the subjectivity of individual sellers and variations in product condi- tion, LLMs often struggle to generate reliable price estimates when the retrieved set is limited in size or displays substantial price disper- sion. Recent work [8, 9] suggests that the entropy of the next-token probability distribution serves as a proxy for uncertainty of LLMs, with higher entropy corresponding to lower confidence. Formally, for a token generated at position \ud835\udc56in a sequence, the entropy \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc56 over the model\u2019s predicted probability distribution \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56is defined as: \u2212\u00cd \ud835\udc57\u2208V \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc57) log \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc57), where V is the vocabulary of LLMs, and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc57) is the probability of the \ud835\udc57-th token. Since a price estimate \u02c6\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5einvolves multiple tokens , we quantify the model\u2019s confidence by computing the average entropy of these tokens as \u00af H. Lower entropy corresponds to higher confidence in the price prediction, whereas higher entropy reflects greater uncertainty. Based on it, we propose a simple, plug-and-play method that leverages the average token-level entropy of the predicted price as an uncertainty proxy to dynamically filter low-quality suggestions. This effectively bal- ances precision and recall in practice, as illustrated in Stage 3 of Figure 2. Specifically, we set an entropy threshold \ud835\udf03H, and retain only predicted prices whose average entropy falls below this value. 5 Experiments 5.1 Settings Datasets. Our experimental data are collected from a large-scale, real-world e-commerce platform, Xianyu. To evaluate the efficacy of our LLP, we construct a test set by randomly sampling 80,000 second-hand products from the top 55 categories, ranked by Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), on a specific day. This initial set man- ually removes anomalous listings, such as those with severely in- complete descriptions, to form the final test set. Furthermore, to assess the generalization capability of our model, we create an ad- ditional dataset comprising 210,267 products sampled from another 611 distinct categories. To prevent data leakage, the training set uses the same top 55 categories but listed 5 days prior to the test set collected date, constructed by bidirectional reasoning (Section 4.3.2). Detailed statistics are presented in Table 1. Our training set contains approximately 620,000 samples, of which 580,000 are used for su- pervised fine-tuning (SFT). The remaining products are reserved for subsequent GRPO. Standardized products [27] refer to items with clear brand and models like smartphone while Non-Standardized products usually have no obvious identifiers. Further details are provided in Appendix A.2. Table 1: Dataset Size Distribution. \"Cats.\" denotes Categories. Split Subset TOP 55 Cats. Other 611 Cats.

These metrics are selected to emphasize relative prediction error over absolute error, which is more indicative of performance in price estimation tasks. Unlike SAR, DAR employs a dynamic relative error threshold that becomes progressively stricter as the product price increases. This property makes the metric more tolerant of errors for low- value products while imposing tighter accuracy requirements for high-value ones.

We benchmark LLP against five representative baseline methods: (a) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a classical algorithm that operates on product text representations [38]; (b) Vision-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained exclusively on visual representations [13]; (c) Multimodal-based DNN that leverages both visual and textual representations [15]; (d) Fine-tuned LLM, a standard LLM directly fine-tuned on the task-specific dataset; (e) Xianyu\u2019s Previous CPV-based Pricing System, firstly identify CPV of the target product using TACLR [39], and then estimate price by GMM. Models. Our experiments utilize a diverse range of Large Language Models (LLMs), encompassing both closed-source models, such as GPT-4.1-Mini [32] and Claude 3.5-Haiku, and leading open-source models, including the Qwen2.5 [36] and Qwen3 [49] series. We assess the performance of these models across different scales. A detailed analysis is available in Appendix A.3.1. Parameters.

We assess the performance of these models across different scales. A detailed analysis is available in Appendix A.3.1. Parameters. During the retrieval phase, we retrieve the 50 most similar products listed within the candidate pool to serve as con- text of prompt for price estimation. Our training pipeline begins with full-parameter SFT, followed by the GRPO where we sample 8 trajectories per prompt. For the inference phase, we select the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model to generate price suggestions, which is distilled from the larger Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using bi-directional reasoning. To ensure reproducibility, we set the generation tempera- ture to 0 and fix the maximum token length at 8192. All experiments are conducted on a cluster of 64 NVIDIA H20 (96GB) GPUs. 5.2 Results As shown in Table 2, our proposed LLP outperforms all baselines across every evaluation metric on the second-hand price prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority. Specifically, vision-based DNN exhibits the weakest performance, with an over- all SAR of only 14.3%, substantially underperforming its multimodal counterpart. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of relying on a single modality for a complex task like price estima- tion. Notably, the fine-tuned LLM also performs poorly, achieving an overall SAR of 24.20%. This suggests that without an effective retrieval and reasoning mechanism, forcing a generative model to simply memorize product information fails to leverage its capabil- ities and can lead to performance degradation due to issues such as hallucination and inherent knowledge bias. LLP demonstrates significant gains on both product types. For standardized products, it achieves a DAR of 66.9%, an improvement of 22.6% compared to the Xianyu\u2019s CPV-based pricing system. On the more challenging non-standardized products, LLP reduces the RMSLE to 0.714 from the baseline of 1.177, a substantial reduction of 46.3%. These results demonstrate that LLP is a robust and practical solution with signif- icant potential for real-world e-commerce pricing applications. 5.3 Analysis 5.3.1 Ablation Study. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to validate the contribution of each component in LLP, with the results presented in Table 3. Both the vanilla LLM and its SFT vari- ant exhibit poor performance in price prediction due to a lack of domain knowledge and the limitations of generative models in re- gression tasks relying on memorization. In contrast, augmenting the LLM with retrieved information as supplementary knowledge yields a significant performance boost. For instance, the SAR on standardized products increases over 3x from 19.7% to 61.0%. This validates the criticality of incorporating external market references. Building on this foundation, subsequent SFT and GRPO steps fur- ther refine the model\u2019s capabilities, culminating in an overall SAR of 65.2%. Together, these results provide strong empirical support for the design rationale of LLP. 5.3.2 Generalization Performance. To evaluate the generalization performance of our framework, we apply model checkpoints trained on the top 55 categories to an independent test set comprising 210,267 products across 611 previously unseen categories. As shown in Table 4, LLP significantly outperforms all baseline methods on every", "rationale of LLP. 5.3.2 Generalization Performance. To evaluate the generalization performance of our framework, we apply model checkpoints trained on the top 55 categories to an independent test set comprising 210,267 products across 611 previously unseen categories. As shown in Table 4, LLP significantly outperforms all baseline methods on every metric. Traditional multimodal-based DNN and the baseline fine-tuned LLM exhibit overfitting to the 55 training categories, re- sulting in limited generalization capability across novel categories. For example, the SFT-only LLM achieves an SAR of only 5.96% on this unseen dataset. In contrast, incorporating similar products retrieved dynamically yields a substantial improvement, achiev- ing an SAR of 34.6%. Moreover, our proposed post-training phase further enhances the LLM\u2019s ability to effectively utilize the con- text: SFT boosts the SAR to 39.4%, and the final GRPO stage yields the best generalization performance with an SAR of 42.9%.

We validate the effectiveness of our confidence-based price filtering mechanism by analyzing its performance on the mobile phone category. Figure 3 presents the Precision-Recall (PR) curve, generated by varying the entropy threshold used for filtering. At a specific threshold \ud835\udf03H, our LLP framework achieves a precision of 78% at 70% product coverage. Ambiguous input or retrieved information leads to higher output entropy, signifying low confidence of LLMs (e.g., \u00af\ud835\udc3b2), which auto- matically triggers filtering of the estimated price. This uncertainty reaches its maximum when no relevant products are retrieved, a condition visualized by the darkest orange point in Figure 3. With a high AUC of 0.77, our approach demonstrates strong discrimina- tive capability, enabling flexible control over the precision-recall trade-off to meet practical requirements in industrial applications. More categories are detailed in the Appendix A.5. 5.3.4 Deployment.", "are retrieved, a condition visualized by the darkest orange point in Figure 3. With a high AUC of 0.77, our approach demonstrates strong discrimina- tive capability, enabling flexible control over the precision-recall trade-off to meet practical requirements in industrial applications. More categories are detailed in the Appendix A.5. 5.3.4 Deployment. For real-world validation, we evaluate LLP us- ing traffic replay simulations and online A/B testing. In the traffic replay experiment, we evaluate LLP on a sample of 100,000 products previously pricing by the CPV-based pricing method (Section 5.1). LLP achieves the SAR of 65.9%, a 15.9% improvement over the pre- vious method. In online testing, previous CPV-based method fails to identify all product attributes (e.g., new brands or models). As a result, it achieves low product coverage, with only 30% recall and 40% SAR on products for which prices can be estimated. In contrast, LLP achieves a SAR of 72% at the same product coverage in the Figure 3: Confidence-based PR Curve of the Mobile Phone Category. The depth of a token\u2019s orange background shading positively correlates with its entropy value. online testing. Even at a 90% recall, LLP maintains a strong SAR of 47%. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLP in a real-world deployment on the Xianyu e-commerce platform. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce LLP, the first generative price predic- tion system tailored for second-hand products on C2C e-commerce platforms. Inspired by the Law of One Price and recent advance- ments in LLMs, LLP adopts a \"retrieval-then-reasoning\" paradigm, effectively overcoming the poor generalization and flexibility of pre- vious regression models. By leveraging real-time retrieval of similar products as dynamic market references and LLMs\u2019 nuanced text understanding of unstructured product descriptions, LLP enhances pricing accuracy and interpretability. We further improve vanilla LLMs\u2019 domain understanding of retrieved products by first perform- ing SFT and then applying GRPO on the dataset constructed via bidirectional reasoning. During inference, LLP filters low-quality price suggestions based on confidence, ensuring its reliability for industrial deployment. Extensive experiments validate the effective- ness of LLP, which substantially outperforms all baselines across various evaluation metrics. Our method offers a new perspective for intelligent product pricing in a generative manner. Future work will explore the applications of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with image token pruning to enhance generation quality within a controlled inference overhead.

Standardized products refer to items with clear specifications, models, and functions that typically adhere to recognized industry standards. Non-standardized prod- ucts, conversely, are defined by an emphasis on individual attributes and subjective appeal rather than uniform standards. Consequently, consumer decisions are driven more by factors such as style, design, and brand identity, leading to lower price sensitivity. The top 55 categories, comprising both standardized and non-standardized product types, are detailed in the Table 5. A.3 Additional Analysis A.3.1 Analysis on Various LLMs. Table 6 provides a detailed per- formance comparison of various open-source and closed-source LLMs on the task of price prediction for second-hand products. We observe a clear Scaling Law: as the number of model parameters increases, the accuracy of the LLMs\u2019 price prediction also improves.

Furthermore, the experi- mental results indicate that the open-source Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct exhibits superior performance over GPT-4.1-mini and Claude 3.5- Haiku across all metrics. Consequently, we ultimately selecte the Qwen2.5 series for pricing tasks.

In this section, we investigate the impact of different product representations on the LLMs\u2019 price prediction. We conduct this analysis using the vanilla Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for all experiments. Table 7 shows that retrieval based on product image representations leads to better performance compared to text representations. This suggests that product images carry essential information as well. More impor- tantly, using multimodal representation of Generative Semantic ID leads to a substantial improvement in the LLMs\u2019 pricing prediction, yielding a nearly 16% decrease in RMSLE relative to using single image or text.

Overall, as the number of retrieved products varies from 0 to 100, the per- formance of our LLP first increases and then declines. Nevertheless, leveraging retrieved similar products as a basis for reasoning con- sistently outperforms LLMs without external knowledge, which validates the effectiveness of the retrieval module. Initially, with a small number of retrieved products, the LLMs\u2019 price prediction accuracy are constrained by a lack of relevant information, so it rises as more products are added. The performance drops when retrieving a large quantity of products (e.g., 100). This can be at- tributed to interference from irrelevant products, and the LLMs\u2019 sensitivity to token positions [21, 29, 34, 35, 47], a phenomenon known as position bias, which arises from thi position encoding. Ultimately, considering the trade-off between inference overhead and performance, we select 50 products as the market references for the LLMs in our practical deployment.

The trends are similar to those observed in the mobile phone category, demonstrating the approach\u2019s generality and ro- bustness across diverse product categories. On the top 10 categories, it achieves over 80% pricing accuracy at 60% product coverage, demonstrating strong reliability in real-world deployment. Even under full coverage, where every product can be price, LLP still sus- tains a pricing accuracy near 70%. In the single handbag category, At 20% product coverage, SAR approaches 100%, demonstrating high pricing accuracy. At the expense of partial product coverage, the system delivers a dramatically improved user experience, while enabling dynamic trade-off between precision and recall. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Recall 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 Precision (SAR) Precision-Recall Curve of Handbag PR Curve (AUC = 0.81) (a) Handbag Category 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Recall 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 Precision (SAR) Precision-Recall Curve of Top10 Categories PR Curve (AUC = 0.77) (b) Top10 Categroy Figure 4: Confidence-based PR Curve of the Handbag and Top 10 Categories.", "RETRACEQA: Evaluating Reasoning Traces of Small Language Models in Commonsense Question Answering Francesco Maria Molfese, Luca Moroni, Ciro Porcaro, Simone Conia, Roberto Navigli Sapienza University of Rome {molfese, moroni, porcaro, conia, navigli}@diag.uniroma1.it Abstract While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on an increasingly wide array of commonsense rea- soning benchmarks, current evaluation prac- tices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those an- swers. To address this issue, we introduce RE- TRACEQA, a novel benchmark that introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense rea- soning tasks. Our expert-annotated dataset re- veals that in a substantial portion of instances (14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overes- timated by evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models (LLMs) as au- tomated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than answer-only metrics, SLM perfor- mance drops significantly across all models and datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%. 1 Introduction Recent work in language modeling has led to ef- fective SLMs with impressive performance lev- els across various benchmarks (Qwen et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024; Fourrier et al., 2024). However, current evaluation prac- tices rely almost exclusively on final answer ac- curacy, i.e., counting an instance as correct when the model\u2019s prediction matches the ground truth, regardless of the reasoning process. This answer- centric approach overlooks a fundamental factor: models can arrive at correct answers through in- valid reasoning paths, artificially inflating perfor- mance metrics and masking important weaknesses in their actual reasoning capabilities. To this end, the research community has recently proposed several benchmarks to examine \u201creason- ing traces\u201d \u2013 the step-by-step explanations gener- ated by language models to arrive at their final answers \u2013 in a more systematic way (Zheng et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024a,b; Tyen et al., 2024a). These benchmarks are necessary for the develop- ment and evaluation of automatic approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs) (Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024b; Lightman et al., 2023) and LLM-as-a-judge (Gu et al., 2025), aimed at identifying the specific location of errors within rea- soning traces and not just the correctness of the fi- nal answer (Zheng et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024a,b; Tyen et al., 2024a). However, contemporary work faces two key limitations. First, existing bench- marks focus primarily on mathematics and science, leaving reasoning processes in other areas like com- monsense reasoning largely underexplored, despite requiring fundamentally different capabilities. Sec- ond, specialized PRMs and LLMs employed as judges are typically used to optimize task perfor- mance through feedback during fine-tuning or Best- of-N sampling, rather than evaluating whether rea- soning traces that reach correct answers contain intermediate errors, potentially leading to inflated performance assessments. Therefore, our research question is: how can we effectively evaluate reason- ing processes in commonsense, and to what extent do current answer-only metrics misrepresent SLM capabilities?", "or Best- of-N sampling, rather than evaluating whether rea- soning traces that reach correct answers contain intermediate errors, potentially leading to inflated performance assessments. Therefore, our research question is: how can we effectively evaluate reason- ing processes in commonsense, and to what extent do current answer-only metrics misrepresent SLM capabilities? To address these limitations, we provide the fol- lowing contributions: \u2022 We introduce RETRACEQA, the first bench- mark for evaluating reasoning traces of SLMs in commonsense reasoning tasks, including a set of 2,421 reasoning traces manually anno- tated with step-level error locations and quali- tative error categorizations; \u2022 Quantitative evidence that up to 24% of flawed reasoning traces still produce the cor- rect final answer, demonstrating how current 1 arXiv:2510.09351v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 answer-only evaluations significantly overes- timate model capabilities; \u2022 Comprehensive reference-based evaluation of both closed and open-source LLMs as judges, revealing that while models can often detect whether a trace is correct as a whole, they struggle to identify the exact location of rea- soning errors; \u2022 Reference-free evaluation of LLM-as-a-judge and mathematical PRMs applied to common- sense reasoning, revealing substantial perfor- mance degradation when transferring across domains. Our findings show that answer-only metrics sub- stantially overestimate SLM performance, with scores dropping by up to 25% when accounting for reasoning correctness, also highlighting the need for reasoning-aware evaluation beyond STEM do- mains. RETRACEQA provides both a practical benchmark and strong evidence that current evalu- ation practices can misrepresent reasoning in com- monsense question answering tasks. 2 Related Work Process-Based Evaluation Approaches. The re- search community has introduced two main ap- proaches to assess reasoning quality beyond fi- nal answers: Process Reward Models (PRMs) and LLM-as-a-judge. PRMs are specialized mod- els fine-tuned to evaluate the correctness of rea- soning steps, in contrast to Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which focus solely on final an- swers (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022). PRMs specifically aim to identify the first erro- neous step in a reasoning trace, enabling both tar- geted feedback for model training and quality filter- ing in Best-of-N selection scenarios (Wang et al., 2024b; Pan et al., 2023). PRMs can be built and trained in several ways: Lightman et al. (2023) used human-labeled data for error detection, while Wang et al. (2024b) and Li et al. (2023) employed Monte Carlo estimation to determine the probabil- ity of a chain of steps to be correct. More recent work by Zhang et al. (2025) and Hosseini et al. (2024) leverages larger LLMs as automated judges to generate training signals for PRMs, creating a teacher-student paradigm for reasoning evaluation. In parallel to specialized PRMs, general-purpose LLMs prompted as judges have emerged as an ef- fective \u2013\u2013 albeit expensive \u2013\u2013 alternative approach. These models assess reasoning trace validity with- out task-specific training, providing both binary correctness judgments and localized error identifi- cation (Zheng et al., 2024). While more flexible than PRMs, judges may lack the specialization that targeted training provides. Benchmarks for Reasoning Evaluation.

While more flexible than PRMs, judges may lack the specialization that targeted training provides. Benchmarks for Reasoning Evaluation. Sev- eral benchmarks have been developed to evaluate models\u2019 abilities to identify errors in reasoning traces, each with distinct characteristics. Process- Bench (Zheng et al., 2024) specifically targets rea- soning error identification by requiring models to indicate the exact location of incorrect steps within mathematical reasoning traces. MR-Ben and MR- GSM8K (Zeng et al., 2024a,b) offer more compre- hensive meta-reasoning assessment, including error localization, error explanation, and suggested cor- rections. Findings from these benchmarks consis- tently demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect reasoning error locations accu- rately, though they show potential for providing helpful corrections once errors are explicitly identi- fied (Tyen et al., 2024b; Huang et al., 2024). Limitations and Research Gaps. Despite progress in process-based evaluation, existing work presents three key limitations. First, PRMs and judge models are primarily used for Best-of-N se- lection, thus ranking multiple outputs to improve generation rather than as tools for validating rea- soning traces during evaluation. Second, current benchmarks are largely restricted to mathemati- cal domains, overlooking reasoning types found in commonsense tasks that involve qualitatively differ- ent inference. Third, the implications of reasoning- aware evaluation on SLM assessment remain un- derexplored, particularly how final answer metrics can misrepresent underlying reasoning quality. 3 ReTraceQA In this section, we introduce RETRACEQA, our novel gold benchmark designed to assess the abil- ity of LLMs to determine whether a reasoning trace of a SLM is correct, or to identify the specific step where an error occurs. Specifically, Section 3.1 provides the formal task definition, Section 3.2 de- scribes the datasets selected for the benchmark, Section 3.3 explains how reasoning traces are gen- erated using a range of SLMs, Section 3.4 explains how we divide the reasoning traces into discrete steps, Section 3.5 details the human annotation pro- 2 ANNOTATION EXAMPLE Question: When ice buildup is on a sidewalk, the ice may be reduced by Choices: A. adding salt B. adding litter C. adding sand D. adding water Raw Model Output: To answer this question, we need to consider the effect of each choice on ice buildup on a sidewalk [...] \\n\\n A.

Figure 1 shows the whole pipeline together with an example of annotation. 3.1 Task Definition Given a commonsense reasoning question, the goal is to evaluate the validity of an SLM-generated reasoning trace by identifying the earliest step at which an error occurs, if any. Formally, let q denote the input question (with an optional set of choices C), and let S = [s0, s1, . . . , sn] represent the step- by-step reasoning trace. The task is to predict an index i \u2208{\u22121, 0, . . . , n}, where i = \u22121 signifies that all reasoning steps are correct, and i \u22650 indi- cates that the first error occurs at step si. This for- mulation is in line with state-of-the-art benchmarks like ProcessBench (Zheng et al., 2024), in which the authors note that, for steps after the first error, the meaning of their correctness may become am- biguous or debatable. Indeed, derivations based on incorrect premises can make sense, but still remain on a globally incorrect reasoning path (Lightman et al., 2023). Based on this assumption, we choose to focus on identifying the earliest-occurring error in the reasoning traces. 3.2 Dataset Selection To construct our benchmark, we source questions from four widely-used datasets in commonsense reasoning: CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019, CSQA), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018, OBQA), QASC (Khot et al., 2020), and Strate- gyQA (Geva et al., 2021), all of which are multiple- choice or binary question answering datasets that provide a question along with a set of candidate answers. These datasets primarily target common- sense reasoning grounded in general world knowl- edge, but also feature questions involving ency- clopedic and subject-specific knowledge, as well as reasoning over spatial, temporal, or causal re- lationships. When test set labels are not publicly available, we follow standard practice and instead sample from the development sets (Molfese et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023); this applies to CSQA and QASC. Collectively, these datasets span a range of reasoning challenges across commonsense do- mains, making them well-suited for evaluating the correctness and robustness of reasoning traces. 3.3 Solution Generation For each instance in our selected datasets, we gen- erate step-by-step reasoning traces using SLMs from the widely used Qwen, LLaMA, and Phi fam- ilies of open-source language models (Qwen et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024). We follow standard practice and define a", "Solution Generation For each instance in our selected datasets, we gen- erate step-by-step reasoning traces using SLMs from the widely used Qwen, LLaMA, and Phi fam- ilies of open-source language models (Qwen et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024). We follow standard practice and define a SLM as any language model with no more than 10 billion parameters (Wang et al., 2024a; Fu et al., 2023). Specifically, we use the following instruction- tuned variants: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, Qwen2.5- 3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B- 3 Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B- Instruct, and Phi-4-mini-instruct. This selection enables us to examine performance variation within model families as model size increases (with the exception of Phi, which is only available in a sin- gle size under 10 billion parameters), while also capturing differences across architectures. We gen- erate traces by prompting models with a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) setup (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2023), which encourages step-by- step reasoning without conditioning on specific examples. Initially, we collect a total of 3,334 original questions distributed across the datasets as follows: 1,221 questions from CSQA, 500 ques- tions from OBQA, 926 questions from QASC and 687 questions from StrategyQA. For each original question, we generate reasoning traces using 7 dis- tinct SLMs, resulting in an initial pool of 23,338 total reasoning traces. Then, we perform careful sampling from this initial pool to ensure three fac- tors simultaneously: (i) balanced representation of correct and incorrect traces in terms of final answer accuracy, (ii) balanced representation of each model and (iii), uniqueness of each question. This sampling step reduces the dataset to a total of 2,779 unique instances (i.e., each instance is a unique question associated with exactly one rea- soning trace). Details about the generation of rea- soning traces can be found in Appendix A, while details about the method used to classify instances as correct/incorrect depending on their final answer can be found in Appendix B. 3.4 Solution Reformatting A key step in building RETRACEQA involves ensuring that model-generated reasoning traces are segmented into coherent, interpretable steps. In mathematical domains, prior work has shown that automatic solutions often require post-hoc re- segmentation due to formatting inconsistencies and unclear boundaries between reasoning steps (Zheng et al., 2024). In contrast, we find that for common- sense reasoning tasks, step segmentation emerges more naturally. When using standard prompting strategies, models tend to produce clearly delin- eated reasoning traces, with each step expressed as a complete and self-contained sentence, making further reformatting unnecessary.1 1We split reasoning traces at \"\\n\\n\". 3.5 Human Annotation To construct a benchmark that enables both binary reasoning evaluation and fine-grained error local- ization, we annotate a diverse set of SLM-generated reasoning traces with step-level error information. The annotation task follows the setup described in Section 3.1: for each reasoning trace, annotators are asked to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or to indicate that the entire trace is correct. Additionally, annotators are asked to assign one of three available labels classifying the nature of the error. Specifically, a step is considered erroneous if it falls in", "reasoning trace, annotators are asked to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or to indicate that the entire trace is correct. Additionally, annotators are asked to assign one of three available labels classifying the nature of the error. Specifically, a step is considered erroneous if it falls in one or more of the following categories: \u2022 Hallucination errors. The model generates unverifiable or false facts (e.g., \u201cwolves are not found in arctic regions\u201d), makes incorrect assumptions, or hallucinates information not inferable from the question or context. \u2022 Reasoning errors. The model fails to rea- son coherently within or across steps. This includes logically unsound or commonsense- violating inferences, contradictory reasoning, and incorrect final selections. For example, stating \u201cwhite is a light color\u201d then claiming \u201cit does not reflect light\u201d. \u2022 Misinterpretation errors. The model misun- derstands the question, choice meanings, or task requirements. This includes misrepresent- ing previous steps, referencing non-existent choices, or providing multiple answers. An example of annotated instance can be found in Figure 1, while examples for each of these cate- gories and detailed annotation guidelines are pro- vided in Appendix C and D, respectively. Three expert annotators with PhD-level back- grounds in computer science or linguistics perform the annotation. Each annotator is given the SLM- generated reasoning trace, the original question, optional answer choices and supporting facts, and the gold answer from the dataset, and is instructed to judge correctness based solely on the reason- ing trace, not on the final answer alone. Annota- tors are also asked to flag problematic instances using a dedicated INVALID tag. These include: ambiguous questions with multiple plausible an- swers, grammatical or structural issues that impair interpretation and labeling inconsistencies in the original dataset (e.g., an incorrect gold answer). To safeguard the quality of the final benchmark, we 4 CSQA OBQA QASC StrategyQA Final samples (error) 296 184 219 271 Final samples (correct) 603 244 245 359 Total samples 899 428 464 630 Process errors (%) 16.3 14.7 16.6 24.0 Invalid instances 238 20 46 54 Avg. steps (error) 8.2 8.1 8.0 6.9 Avg. steps (correct) 8.2 7.8 7.9 6.8 Error Type Distribution (%) Hallucination 41.9 46.7 47.5 62.5 Reasoning 34.0 34.7 35.4 27.9 Misinterpretation 24.1 18.6 17.1 9.6 Table 1: RETRACEQA statistics.

Error type distributions are calculated over all erroneous traces. exclude all flagged instances. This results in a to- tal of 2,421 clean and fully annotated examples in RETRACEQA. To evaluate annotation consistency, we randomly sample 25 instances from each of the four datasets in the benchmark (100 total). All three annotators independently label this subset following the same guidelines. Inter-annotator agreement, measured via Fleiss\u2019s kappa, yields a score of 84.4%, indi- cating an \u201calmost perfect\u201d agreement according to standard interpretation (Landis and Koch, 1977). 3.6 Benchmark Statistics Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the reason- ing traces across each subset, including the number of samples that reach a correct or incorrect final answer, the proportion", "a score of 84.4%, indi- cating an \u201calmost perfect\u201d agreement according to standard interpretation (Landis and Koch, 1977). 3.6 Benchmark Statistics Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the reason- ing traces across each subset, including the number of samples that reach a correct or incorrect final answer, the proportion of process errors (instances with correct answers but flawed reasoning), the percentage of instances falling in each of the avail- able error categories and descriptive statistics on reasoning trace length. A key observation is that a non-trivial percentage of responses, averaging to 17.9% across datasets, arrive at the correct final answer despite containing a reasoning error. This pattern is consistent with findings from mathematical reasoning benchmarks (Zheng et al., 2024), in which even strong lan- guage models are able to reach the correct answer while making mathematical mistakes, and high- lights a critical limitation of standard evaluation practices, which often overlook flawed intermedi- ate reasoning when only final answers are assessed. As a result, leaderboard metrics may overestimate the true reasoning capability of language models. Moreover, we can see a consistent distribution of error types across the four subsets of our bench- mark. Specifically, hallucination errors constitute the majority of failures (41.9%\u201362.5%), followed by reasoning errors (27.9%\u201335.4%) and misinter- pretation errors (9.6%\u201324.1%). This suggests that SLMs struggle primarily with factual grounding, frequently generating unverifiable claims or incor- rect assumptions, though logical coherence issues also remain prevalent, accounting for roughly one- third of all errors. The lower proportion of misin- terpretation errors indicates that models generally understand task requirements and question seman- tics, but fail both in anchoring their reasoning in ac- curate world knowledge and in maintaining sound logical inference chains. Individual statistics for each model are provided in Appendix E. 4 Experimental Setup Our benchmark evaluates LLMs along two axes: (1) reference-free assessment of SLM reasoning trace validity to determine whether models can reli- ably provide fine-tuning feedback or perform Best- of-N selection without ground truth labels, and (2) reference-based assessment where models judge reasoning traces using both the correct answer and reasoning process, extending evaluation beyond fi- nal answer correctness alone. In the following, we list the models used for our experiments (Section 4.1) and the evaluation metrics for both reference- free and reference-based settings (Section 4.2). 4.1 Models LLM-as-a-judge. We follow recent work on au- tomated evaluation (Zheng et al., 2023) by prompt- ing LLMs to assess SLM reasoning traces. The prompt is slightly adapted from prior work (Zheng et al., 2024) to better suit commonsense reasoning tasks (Appendix F). We evaluate the following set of open-weight and closed models: Mistral-Small- 24B-Instruct-2501 (Mistral, 2025), Llama-3.3-70B- Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-72B- Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025), Gemini-2.0-Flash (DeepMind, 2025), DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI et al., 2024a), GTP-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024a) and o1-mini (Ope- nAI et al., 2024b). Greedy decoding is used for all models except o1-mini and DeepSeek-R1, for which we report performance using a sample at temperature 1.0 due to API constraints. Process Reward Models. We evaluate several publicly available PRMs by extracting their", "GTP-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024a) and o1-mini (Ope- nAI et al., 2024b). Greedy decoding is used for all models except o1-mini and DeepSeek-R1, for which we report performance using a sample at temperature 1.0 due to API constraints. Process Reward Models. We evaluate several publicly available PRMs by extracting their step- wise correctness predictions and identifying the 5 first step flagged as incorrect. The evaluated models fall into three groups: (1) math-shepherd- mistral-7B (Wang et al., 2024b), which uses empirical correctness likelihoods over reasoning steps; (2) Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B and Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-7B (Sky- work, 2024), which output raw scalar scores; (3) Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K and Qwen2.5-PRM- 7B (Zheng et al., 2024), fine-tuned respectively on the PRM800K dataset and on synthetic data derived from LLM-as-a-judge annotations. For models in groups (1) and (3), trained with sigmoid activations over each step, we determine step correctness by rounding predictions to the near- est integer (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect). For models in group (2), we select a threshold that maximizes F1 on a validation split of CSQA, following Zheng et al. (2024), and use it to round scalar scores. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics Reasoning Trace Evaluation. For both reference-free and reference-based settings, we evaluate models using two complementary metrics: correct, measuring accuracy in identifying fully valid traces (human-labeled as \u22121), and error, measuring accuracy in localizing the first erroneous step in flawed traces (human-labeled as i, where i \u22650). These metrics assess whether LLMs can provide targeted feedback to SLMs during training and quantify their reliability for Best-of-N scoring during evaluation. Following prior work (Zheng et al., 2024), we report the harmonic mean (F1) of correct and error to balance overly permissive versus overly critical model behaviors. Downstream SLM Evaluation. To assess the im- pact of reasoning-aware evaluation on SLMs using LLM-as-a-judge, we employ the best-performing judge from the reference-based evaluation on RE- TRACEQA under two configurations: (1) answer- only evaluation (simulating standard approaches) and (2) full trace validation (accepting predictions only when both reasoning and answers are correct). We measure performance using accuracy (correctly distinguishing valid from invalid traces: i = \u22121 vs. i \u0338= \u22121) and error recall (identifying flawed traces where both model and human annotations indicate i \u0338= \u22121). We evaluate seven SLMs with the same judge under the two settings across four common- sense datasets, generating diverse reasoning traces at temperature 0.7 to ensure variety while avoiding overlap with our annotated benchmark. 5 Results In this section, we first present LLM performance on reference-free and reference-based evaluation on RETRACEQA (Section 5.1). We then report downstream SLM evaluation results, where the best-performing LLM-as-a-judge on RETRACEQA is used to assess SLM-generated outputs across multiple benchmarks (Section 5.2). 5.1 Reasoning Trace Evaluation Reference-free Evaluation. Table 2 highlights substantial limitations of LLM-as-a-judge and PRMs when asked to assess SLM reasoning traces in commonsense reasoning tasks under reference- free evaluation. Overall, F1 scores across all four datasets remain relatively low, even for the strongest judges, suggesting that reliably evaluat- ing the soundness of reasoning traces remains a challenging task. While state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and o1-mini outperform others with F1", "reasoning traces in commonsense reasoning tasks under reference- free evaluation. Overall, F1 scores across all four datasets remain relatively low, even for the strongest judges, suggesting that reliably evaluat- ing the soundness of reasoning traces remains a challenging task. While state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and o1-mini outperform others with F1 scores exceeding 60% on some datasets, the aver- age F1 across models hovers around 54\u201356%, indi- cating considerable room for improvement. These results underscore a key challenge in deploying LLM-as-a-judge in reinforcement learning or Best- of-N selection settings: their current inability to robustly identify and reward correct intermediate reasoning without having access to the correct la- bel limits their usefulness for guiding reasoning- focused learning objectives. Additionally, PRMs originally developed and trained for mathematical tasks perform signifi- cantly worse across all datasets, with average F1 scores often below 25%. This performance gap em- phasizes the PRMs\u2019 limited generalization capabil- ities when transferred to commonsense reasoning. Reference-based Evaluation. Table 2 (bottom) reports reference-based evaluation results across the four subsets in RETRACEQA. Most models achieve moderate to strong performance in identi- fying globally correct reasoning traces, but accu- rately localizing specific error steps remains sub- stantially more challenging. Model size corre- lates positively with performance. For instance, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms Mistral-Small- 24B-Instruct by +35.5% F1 on average.

Moreover, we can see that a consistent pattern emerges: models detect trace correctness better than localizing er- rors. For instance, o1-mini achieves 74.3% error classification on OBQA, still lagging behind its cor- rectness detection ability. Figure 2 compares error position distributions between human annotations and o1-mini predictions. Errors most commonly occur at steps 3-4, suggesting that while early con- text establishment succeeds, errors emerge during mid-level inference. We can see that o1-mini\u2019s pre- dictions mirror human patterns well, particularly on CSQA and QASC, but show heavier tails, indi- cating over-assignment of blame to later steps, po- tentially capturing error consequences rather than origins. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge systems: while stronger models align well with human evaluations of overall correctness, precisely identifying error origins remains an open challenge. 5.2 Downstream SLM Evaluation While the reference-based evaluation results in Sec- tion 5.1 show that current LLMs employed as au- tomated judges may not reliably localize errors for fine-tuning feedback, their strong performance in assessing overall trace correctness suggests poten- tial for more faithful SLM evaluation. Here we in- vestigate whether reasoning-aware judges that con- sider both trace validity and final answers provide more accurate assessments than standard answer- only evaluation.

This empha- sizes the importance of process-aware evaluation for faithful SLM assessment. Building on this finding, we evaluate multiple SLMs under both paradigms to quantify the discrep- ancy between answer-only and reasoning-aware evaluation. Table 4 reveals a consistent 18.6 per- centage point average drop when using reasoning- aware evaluation, demonstrating how traditional metrics overestimate SLM capabilities. Even high- performing models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct show substantial drops (81.0% to 67.5%). These results align with our benchmark analysis (Section 3.6) showing 17.9% of instances reach correct answers through flawed reasoning, and re- inforce that o1-mini as a judge better aligns with human assessments. The findings underscore the critical need for reasoning-aware evaluation frame- works that move beyond final answer correctness to accurately reflect SLM reasoning capabilities. 6 Conclusions In this work, we introduced RETRACEQA, a new gold benchmark for evaluating reasoning traces of SLMs through step-level annotations, includ- ing error type locations and categorizations.

Our manually annotated benchmark reveals that stan- dard answer-only metrics consistently overestimate SLM performance: on average, 17.9% of the time, SLMs arrive at correct answers via a reasoning that contains at least one significant error. Moreover, introducing reasoning-aware evaluation shows that their scores are inflated by up to 25%. Our manual error analysis shows that SLMs struggle primarily with factual grounding (hallucinations account for 41.9-62.5% of errors), though logical coherence issues are also significant (27.9-35.4%). Although our work demonstrates that commer- cial LLMs are strong judges and can distinguish correct vs. incorrect traces effectively, they still struggle with precise error localization. Addition- ally, open PRMs trained on math reasoning fail to transfer to commonsense tasks, highlighting domain-specific gaps and the need for non-math process-level benchmarks like RETRACEQA. We hope RETRACEQA encourages broader adoption of reasoning-aware evaluation protocols for more faithful assessment of language models. 8 Limitations Our work provides valuable insights into reason- ing trace evaluation for commonsense reasoning, though some limitations should be taken into ac- count. First, our benchmark focuses exclusively on English-language commonsense reasoning tasks. Extending this evaluation framework to multilin- gual settings would be valuable for understanding whether reasoning patterns and error distributions vary across languages. Second, while we selected four diverse datasets for commonsense reasoning and extended reasoning trace evaluation beyond mathematics and science, it would be valuable to extend current work on benchmarks capturing rea- soning patterns required in other domains such as procedural reasoning or narrative comprehension. Future work should extend this evaluation frame- work to a broader range of reasoning modalities to establish more comprehensive benchmarks. Fi- nally, our results demonstrate that PRMs trained on mathematical reasoning transfer poorly to common- sense domains, with performance degrading sub- stantially. This domain transfer limitation suggests that reasoning evaluation techniques may require domain-specific adaptations rather than assuming general transferability across reasoning tasks, mo- tivating the need to develop specialized PRMs for other domains beyond mathematics and science. Overall, while our work provides a solid foun- dation for reasoning trace evaluation, addressing these limitations will be crucial for advancing the field and developing more robust reasoning models.

A Solution Generation Prompts Table 5 and 6 show the prompts used in our work to generate the solutions for the multiple-choice and binary commonsense reasoning benchmarks, respectively. Specifically, we use the standard zero- shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2023) to elicit explicit model reasoning. B Answer Extractor Details To ensure that our benchmark contains a balanced number of model outputs reaching a correct or in- correct solution, we use a state-of-the-art LLM- based answer extractor (Yu et al., 2025, xFinder). We select this answer-extraction method rather that relying on simple regular expressions because of its higher agreement with human judgment in scenar- ios involving free-form text generation (Molfese et al., 2025). Specifically, we adopt xFinder- llama38it,2 the best-performing variant based on Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. We prompt xFinder by providing it with the input question, the optional set of choices and the model output. We then ex- tract its generated output and compare it against the correct answer. We deem an instance as correct if it reaches the correct answer and incorrect otherwise. 2https://huggingface.co/IAAR-Shanghai/ xFinder-llama38it SYSTEM You are an expert in commonsense question answering.

The first two examples illustrate hallucination er- rors, where the reasoning traces contain incorrect or non-verifiable statements, such as: \u201cbowling al- ley is not the typical location for throwing a ball at pins\u201d and \u201cleaves are the primary source of nectar for honey production.\u201d The third and fourth exam- ples show reasoning errors. In the third example, the model correctly states that \u201cthe word \u2018being still\u2019 (A) implies that the person is not moving\u201d but then incorrectly concludes that this \u201cwould make it harder to hear movements,\u201d which is not logically valid. Similarly, the fourth example contains an illogical statement: \u201cwould not provide much heat- reflecting,\u201d derived from the correct observation that \u201cecru: This color is very light.\u201d The last two examples represent misinterpretation errors. In the fifth example, the model fails to relate the meaning of the answer choices to the question, while in the sixth example, it selects label \u201cE,\u201d which is not among the provided choices. 11 SYSTEM You are an expert in commonsense question answering.

USER Question: {question} Table 6: Prompt for the StrategyQA dataset. D Annotation Guidelines D.1 Task Overview The goal of our annotation process is to evaluate the step-by-step reasoning traces generated by SLMs in response to questions requiring commonsense reasoning. Annotators are tasked to identify the earliest point in the reasoning trace where an error occurs. Importantly, the final answer produced by the model may be correct even if the intermediate reasoning steps are flawed. As such, annotations focus solely on the reasoning trace rather than final output alone. Each annotation instance includes the question, optional answer choices (for multiple- choice tasks), the ground truth answer, and the model-generated reasoning trace broken into dis- crete steps.3 In some cases, additional contextual facts drawn from the original datasets are provided to assist the annotator. D.2 Annotation Objective Annotators are instructed to read each step in the reasoning trace and identify the first step that con- tains an error. The task is framed as a classification problem, where annotators assign an integer index to indicate the position of the first erroneous step. Step indices are zero-based (i.e., 0 refers to the first step), and a value of \u22121 is used to", "the first step that con- tains an error. The task is framed as a classification problem, where annotators assign an integer index to indicate the position of the first erroneous step. Step indices are zero-based (i.e., 0 refers to the first step), and a value of \u22121 is used to denote that all steps in the reasoning trace are correct. Moreover, annotators are tasked to categorize the nature of the error using one of three available labels: hallucina- tion, reasoning, and misinterpretation errors. 3In the following, we use the terms \u201csteps\u201d and \u201cpara- graphs\u201d interchangeably. D.3 Error Definition We define three categories of errors that annotators use to classify erroneous reasoning steps: Hallucination Errors. This category covers er- rors where the model generates unverifiable or false facts. Examples include stating that \u201cwolves are not found in arctic regions\u201d or claiming that \u201cleaves are the primary source of nectar for honey produc- tion\u201d (when flowers are the actual source). This category encompasses: \u2022 Incorrect facts or assumptions that are not gen- erally valid \u2022 Hallucinated information that is not inferable from the question or context Example: A model stating \u201crejection is the most likely outcome of an interview\u201d presents an incor- rect fact that is not generally valid, constituting a hallucination error. Reasoning Errors. This category covers errors where the model fails to reason coherently. For in- stance, stating \u201cwhite is a light color\u201d (correct) but then claiming \u201cit does not reflect light\u201d (incorrect) represents incoherent reasoning. This category in- cludes: \u2022 Logically unsound or commonsense-violating inferences \u2022 Contradictory or internally incoherent reason- ing \u2022 Ruling out the correct option or selecting a final answer that does not match the ground truth Example: For the question \u201cWhere spiders might be found among tools?\u201d, a model stating \u201ca garage may store tools\u201d but then ruling out garage as \u201cnot the most likely place\u201d with unsound reasoning com- mits a reasoning error. Misinterpretation Errors. This category in- cludes scenarios where the model misinterprets the question objective, the meaning of answer choices, or the task requirements. This encompasses: \u2022 Misinterpreting the question or misrepresent- ing previous steps \u2022 Referencing non-existent answer choices 12 \u2022 Selecting multiple answers when only one is required \u2022 Misunderstanding the task objective Example: For the question \u201cWhy would you take a bus to work?\u201d with choice A being \u201ccommute,\u201d a model ruling out this correct option because \u201cthe question asks why someone would take a bus, not what a bus is used for\u201d demonstrates misinterpreta- tion of the question\u2019s objective. D.4 Non-errors Not all irregularities in reasoning traces qualify as errors. Annotators are explicitly instructed not to flag the following as erroneous: \u2022 Minor grammatical issues or unusual phrasing that do not affect semantic content. \u2022 Verbose, redundant, or overly detailed reason- ing that remains logically sound. D.5 Annotation Procedure The annotation process involves six key steps: 1. Read the question, any associated answer choices, and any additional supporting facts. 2. Consult the ground truth answer to understand the correct resolution. 3. Examine each reasoning step in sequence. 4. Determine whether", "reason- ing that remains logically sound. D.5 Annotation Procedure The annotation process involves six key steps: 1. Read the question, any associated answer choices, and any additional supporting facts. 2. Consult the ground truth answer to understand the correct resolution. 3. Examine each reasoning step in sequence. 4. Determine whether each step is sound follow- ing the provided guidelines. 5. Record the index of the first erroneous step, or \u22121 if all steps are correct. 6. Categorize the error type (hallucination, rea- soning, or misinterpretation) if an error is found. Importantly, annotators are instructed to mark only the earliest point in the trace where an er- ror occurs, as later steps may be incorrect solely due to propagation from a previously erroneous step (Zheng et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2023). This process ensures that annotations are consis- tent, fine-grained, and focused on evaluating the internal validity of reasoning traces rather than their final outcomes alone. D.6 Identifying Invalid Instances During the annotation process, some instances may be identified as problematic due to flaws in the orig- inal question or labeling. To maintain the quality of the benchmark and avoid propagating errors from upstream datasets, annotators are asked to flag such examples with a special INVALID tag. The follow- ing conditions qualify an instance for exclusion: (i) the question contains severe grammatical issues that compromise its interpretation; (ii) multiple an- swer choices are semantically identical or equally valid; (iii) the dataset\u2019s annotated ground truth is demonstrably incorrect based on commonsense or factual knowledge; and (iv) the instance lacks a unique, clearly correct answer. Instances tagged as INVALID are excluded from the analysis. E Individual Model Statistics Figure 3 shows the individual process error rates of the seven SLMs listed in Section 3.3 (we omit \u201cInstruct\u201d tags for readability), measured as the per- centage of instances in which an incorrect reason- ing trace leads to the correct final answer. In par- ticular, we can see that the trend is approximately the same for each subset of RETRACEQA: smaller models correspond to higher process error rates, with the latter decreasing as model size increases.

We first investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding- time approach, THINKLOGIT, which utilizes logit arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long rea- soning using a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model, a setup we refer to as THINKLOGIT-DPO. Our ex- periments demonstrate that THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO achieve a relative improve- ment in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill- Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x smaller. Moreover, we find that THINKLOGIT remains effective when the guider and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to post- training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised distillation or re- inforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield stronger large models, offering a practi- cal path to unlock long reasoning in large-scale models without costly post-training.1 1 Introduction Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), Ope- nAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024), and Qwen3 (Qwen Team, 2025), have significantly advanced reasoning by leveraging inference-time compute (Snell et al., * Correspondence to yunxiang@umich.edu 1Our code is publicly avaiable at https://github.com/ yunx-z/ThinkLogit. 2024; Brown et al., 2024). These models generate very long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces involving planning, reflection, and self-correction (Gandhi et al., 2025). It is widely believed that such be- haviors require specialized training, either through reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable re- wards (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024) or supervised distilla- tion (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025) from other LRMs. However, such training is costly for large models with long generations and many pa- rameters. Meanwhile, existing training-free long CoT elicitation methods (Pang et al., 2025; Muen- nighoff et al., 2025; Zou et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025) still remain limited, as they often lengthen outputs without reliably inducing genuine long reasoning and further require domain- specific supervision or white-box access. While the training costs are often prohibitive for large mod- els, small models can be trained with modest com- pute (Dang and Ngo, 2025; Luo et al., 2025a). This observation motivates our central research ques- tion: Can a small reasoning model elicit long CoT behavior in a large non-reasoning model at infer- ence time, without training the large model? We address this question with a decoding-time method, THINKLOGIT, which elicits long CoT", "Ngo, 2025; Luo et al., 2025a). This observation motivates our central research ques- tion: Can a small reasoning model elicit long CoT behavior in a large non-reasoning model at infer- ence time, without training the large model? We address this question with a decoding-time method, THINKLOGIT, which elicits long CoT reasoning in a large non-reasoning model as the target. At each decoding step, we use logit arith- metic (Liu et al., 2021, 2024; Mitchell et al., 2024) by computing the logit difference between a small guider model trained for long reasoning and its base version, and add the resulting shift to the tar- get logits. This token-by-token guidance transfers long reasoning signals from the small model to the large one without requiring any training of the tar- get. Furthermore, since the output distributions of long and short CoTs differ substantially, we align them by training the small guider to correct errors made by the target model while maintaining the strengths of the target model. This training pro- 1 arXiv:2510.09354v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 cess uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) on mixed preference pairs sampled from both the guider and target models, thereby making THINKLOGIT more on-policy, and then applies logit arithmetic using the fine-tuned guider. We refer to this approach as THINKLOGIT- DPO and show that such training can further boost performance compared to THINKLOGIT. We evaluate our methods on five challenging benchmarks covering mathematical and scientific reasoning. Our results show that fusing the logits of a small reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill- Qwen-1.5B) with those of a large target (Qwen2.5- 32B) yields 24.5% and 29.1% relative accuracy gains with THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO, respectively, over the frozen target baseline. We fur- ther show that our method remains effective even when the target and guider models come from dif- ferent families. Specifically, we show that a Qwen- based guider can drive long reasoning from a Llama target, highlighting cross-family generalization. We further demonstrate that THINKLOGIT can emu- late reinforcement learning in large frozen models by leveraging small RL-trained guiders, sidestep- ping the prohibitive cost of direct RL at scale. Our ablation study shows that gains of THINKLOGIT- DPO arise only when preference pairs combine the strengths of both the guider and target models. Our approach is particularly favorable when training the target is infeasible: extreme-scale mod- els beyond practical fine-tuning budgets (Dettmers et al., 2023), black-box models limited to logit access (Ormazabal et al., 2023),2 or privacy- preserving settings where an on-device guider steers a centralized model without exposing pri- vate data (McMahan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2024). In these important scenarios, it enables efficient reasoning transfer without full-model fine-tuning. 2 Related Work Eliciting Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 (OpenAI, 2024, 2025), DeepSeek- R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), and QwQ (Team, 2025), outperform standard LLMs on logic, math, and programming tasks, with the ability to revisit earlier steps and leverage extra test-time computa- tion to generate longer reasoning chains.

A com- mon way to elicit long reasoning is reinforcement 2For example, the OpenAI API exposes a logit_bias parameter that lets users alter token probabilities at inference by boosting or suppressing specific tokens (OpenAI, 2025). learning (Lambert et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025), which optimizes the model for outcome-based correctness rewards. A complementary line of work demonstrates that the same capability can be acquired with data- efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Distilled long CoTs from stronger teacher models allow a student to extend its reasoning length and improve accuracy with as few as one thousand training ex- amples (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). However, applying either RL or SFT to large models requires signif- icant resources (e.g., 16 H100 GPUs for SFT a 32B model reported by Muennighoff et al. (2025)), making these approaches infeasible for many prac- titioners. Our THINKLOGIT framework emulates the benefits of SFT or RL on large targets without incurring this heavy training cost. Finally, training- free methods exploit the fact that pretrained LLMs already exhibit long CoT behaviours (Liu et al., 2025; Gandhi et al., 2025). Tang et al. (2025) in- ject contrastive long-versus-short CoT representa- tions into hidden states via representation engineer- ing (Zou et al., 2023), whereas Zhao et al. (2025) amplify a handful of key neurons at inference. Both techniques, however, require domain-specific long/short CoTs and white-box access, limiting their applicability in out-of-domain or black-box settings. In contrast, our flexible methods do not require domain-specific supervision, or parameter access to the target model. Logit Arithmetic. Logit arithmetic is a decoding- time technique that blends token-level output distri- butions from multiple models (Liu et al., 2021; Ormazabal et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024), and has been applied to emulate pre- training (Mitchell et al., 2024), task-specific fine- tuning (Liu et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024), knowl- edge unlearning (Huang et al., 2025), and overrid- ing safety filters (Zhao et al., 2024). In these appli- cations, the guiding signal typically induces rela- tively shallow adjustments, such as shifting style, steering toward domain-specific vocabulary, or sup- pressing certain behaviors, with only modest distri- butional divergence from the target. In contrast, our setting demands bridging a larger gap: the guider produces long CoTs that not only exceed the tar- get\u2019s short reasoning in length but also introduce substantially more complex cognitive behaviors, in- cluding systematic backtracking, verification, and self-reflection (Gandhi et al., 2025). To our knowl- 2 Figure 1: Overview of our proposed THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO approaches to elicit long chain-of- thought reasoning from a large non-reasoning model that is frozen. edge, THINKLOGIT is the first to demonstrate that logit arithmetic can elicit such behaviors in large non-reasoning models.

THINKLOGIT-DPO fur- ther introduces a novel alignment strategy that mit- igates distribution mismatch between long- and short-CoT reasoning for better performance. 3 Methodology Our goal is to elicit long CoT reasoning capabili- ties from a large, frozen, non-reasoning language model without expensive training. We introduce two lightweight decoding-time techniques (see Fig- ure 1): THINKLOGIT, which transfers long CoT behaviors from a small guider via simple logit arith- metic (Liu et al., 2024), and THINKLOGIT-DPO, which further refines the guider using Direct Pref- erence Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) to align its guidance with the target model. 3.1 THINKLOGIT Let z1:t = z1, . . . , zt be the partially decoded se- quence of reasoning tokens at step t. For any lan- guage model f, denote its pre-softmax logits at the next step by \u2113(f) t+1 = f(z1:t) \u2208R|V|, where V is the vocabulary. We assume three models during inference: \u2022 large (target) L, a pre-trained LLM lacking long CoT capability; \u2022 small base S0, a pre-trained model without long reasoning fine-tuning; \u2022 small reasoning (guider) S, obtained via long CoT post-training to S0. At decoding step t+1, the fused logits are com- puted as \u02dc\u2113t+1 = \u2113(L) t+1 + \u03b1 \u0000\u2113(S) t+1 \u2212\u2113(S0) t+1 \u0001 , where \u03b1 \u22650 controls the guidance strength. The delta term \u2113(S) \u2212\u2113(S0) encodes the probability shift that turns a short-CoT model into a long-CoT one. Intuitively, adding this delta to L induces analo- gous long reasoning behaviors without altering its weights. Warm-up for Stable Decoding. We empirically observe that directly applying logit arithmetic at each decoding step would cause many repetitive generations in the long CoT outputs. To stabilize generations, we defer inference-time guidance for long CoT until a prefix of length T: \u02dc\u2113t+1 = ( \u2113(L) t+1, t + 1 \u2264T, \u2113(L) t+1 + \u03b1 \u0000\u2113(S) t+1 \u2212\u2113(S0) t+1 \u0001 , t + 1 > T, (1) 3.2 THINKLOGIT-DPO The effectiveness of THINKLOGIT can be con- strained by distribution mismatches between the guider and target. To address this, we further train the small model as a stronger guider that corrects target reasoning errors while retaining the target strengths, using a mixture of two types of prefer- ence pairs sampled from both the target L and the guider S outputs: 3 Type-1: (x, yL\u2713, yS\u00d7) \u2014 The large model\u2019s cor- rect (short) CoT is preferred over the small model\u2019s incorrect (long) one. This encourages the guider to preserve the correctness of the target model and avoid introducing new errors.

Let \u03b8 denote the parameters of the preference-optimized guider, initialized from S. We train \u03b8 with a DPO objective function that mixes the two pair types: LDPO(\u03b8) = \u03bb E(x,yL\u2713,yS\u00d7)\u223cD1 \u2113\u03b8 \u0000x; yL\u2713, yS\u00d7\u0001 +(1 \u2212\u03bb) E(x,yS\u2713,yL\u00d7)\u223cD2 \u2113\u03b8 \u0000x; yS\u2713, yL\u00d7\u0001 , (2) where \u2113\u03b8 \u0000x; y+, y\u2212\u0001 = log \u03c3 \u0000r\u03b8(x, y+) \u2212 r\u03b8(x, y\u2212) \u0001 , \u03c3 is the sigmoid function, r\u03b8(x, y) = \u03b2[log \u03c0\u03b8(y | x) \u2212log \u03c0ref(y | x)] is the implicit re- ward of output y, and \u03bb \u2208[0, 1] balances the two datasets D1 (Type-1) and D2 (Type-2). We use \u03bb= |D1| |D1|+|D2| by default, directly concatenating two datasets as DPO training data without further rebalancing. After fine-tuning, we replace S in THINKLOGIT with the optimized guider to obtain THINKLOGIT-DPO. 4 Experimental Setup Benchmarks. We evaluate models on five widely used reasoning benchmarks for LRMs. Four of them are competition math problems sources from AIME2024 (30 problems), AIME2025 (30 prob- lems), AMC23 (40 problems), and a subset of 134 hard problems (level 5) from MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2024). We also evaluate on another scien- tific reasoning dataset GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), consisting of 198 PhD-level science ques- tions in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. For each dataset, we independently sample 8 completions with a decoding temperature of 0.6 and maximum output length of 8192, and then compute their aver- age accuracy as Avg@8 for our primary metric. Models. Our primary target model is Qwen2.5- 32B (Yang et al., 2024a). We guide it using R1- Distill-Qwen-1.5B (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), a 1.5B parameter model based on Qwen2.5-Math- 1.5B (Yang et al., 2024b) that has been supervised fine-tuned on 800K long CoT examples distilled from DeepSeek-R1. In our main experiment setup (Section 5.1), the target, guider, and its base model all come from the same Qwen family and share an identical tokenizer, allowing their output logits to be directly combined arithmetically. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we investigate several alternative model configu- rations. First, to demonstrate robustness across heterogeneous model families, we employ R1- Distill-Qwen-1.5B as the guider of Llama-3.3-70B- Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) for long reasoning (Section 5.3). Second, we show that THINKLOGIT can emulate the benefits of RL on larger models without resource-intensive training by evaluating its effectiveness with two guiders produced via RL rather than distillation (Section 6.1): One-Shot- RLVR-1.5B3 (Wang et al., 2025) and DeepScaleR- 1.5B-Preview (Luo et al., 2025b). Unless other- wise noted, THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO use T=100 warmup steps and a guidance strength of \u03b1=1 as the default hyperparameters. Preference Data Construction. We use the level 4\u20135 subset of the MATH training set (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and sample 5 completions for each question from both the guider", "Unless other- wise noted, THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO use T=100 warmup steps and a guidance strength of \u03b1=1 as the default hyperparameters. Preference Data Construction. We use the level 4\u20135 subset of the MATH training set (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and sample 5 completions for each question from both the guider model (S) and the target model (L). Each completion is checked for final-answer correctness against the gold label.4 The target model L yields 12,412 correct com- pletions (yL\u2713) and 16,448 incorrect ones (yL\u00d7), whereas the guider S produces 18,651 correct (yS\u2713) and 10,209 incorrect (yS\u00d7) completions. Forming the Cartesian product for each question gives 11,974 Type-1 preference pairs \u0000yL\u2713, yS\u00d7\u0001 and 43,209 Type-2 pairs \u0000yS\u2713, yL\u00d7\u0001 , for a total of 55,183 pairs. We then randomly select 10K preference pairs from the total 55K pairs for the DPO training. To save training compute, we apply LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) with a rank size of 64 for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the guider model. More training details are in Appendix A. 3We use the checkpoint released at https: //huggingface.co/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR-Qwen2. 5-Math-1.5B-pi1_pi13. 4We robustly extract answers from \\boxed{} and compute exact match with ground-truths based on this script https://github.com/openai/prm800k/blob/main/ prm800k/grading/grader.py by (Lightman et al., 2024). 4 Model # Trainable Params AIME 2024 AIME 2025 AMC 23 MATH Level 5 GPQA Diamond Average (Guider) R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B - 16.2 18.8 51.2 47.5 28.9 32.5 (Target) Qwen2.5-32B - 14.6 8.3 57.2 44.7 36.9 32.3 No Fine-tuning of the Target Target + THINKLOGIT 0 22.5 +6.3 19.2 +0.3 62.2 +5.0 55.3 +7.8 41.8 +4.9 40.2 +7.7 Target + THINKLOGIT-DPO 78M 22.1 +5.9 21.7 +2.9 63.7 +6.5 58.5 +11.0 42.4 +5.5 41.7 +9.2 Full Fine-tuning of the Target s1.1-32B 32B 32.9 25.4 70.0 72.2 51.9 44.5 R1-Distill-Qwen-32B 32B 45.8 35.0 76.9 72.7 55.6 57.2 Table 1: Comparison of avg@8 performance across five reasoning benchmarks. The yellow cells highlight the improvement of our methods over the stronger baseline model (Target or Guider). We show that THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO provide substantial gains over the baselines and partially recovers the benefits of full-model fine-tuning without any training of the large target model. 5 Experiment Results 5.1 Main Results Table 1 presents the avg@8 accuracies for all sys- tems. We highlight two key observations. First, THINKLOGIT consistently boosts reasoning accu- racy upon both the target and the guider model, and THINKLOGIT-DPO raises it further. Combining the logits of the 32B target with those of the 1.5B guider (THINKLOGIT) raises the average accuracy by 24.5% relative to the frozen target and by 23.7% relative to the guider. Replacing the vanilla guider with the DPO-trained guider (THINKLOGIT-DPO) brings the relative improvement to 29.1% over the target model, without any extra inference cost. Second, our approach significantly narrows the performance gap with full-parameter fine-tuning while modifying only a small subset of weights. With LoRA, we adjust only 78M adapter parame- ters, yet THINKLOGIT-DPO closes 77% of the avg@8 gap between the frozen 32B target and the fully fine-tuned s1.1-32B (Muennighoff et al., 2025), which updates all 32B parameters.

Al- though our pipeline uses a 1.5B guider (R1-distill- 1.5B) fine-tuned on 800K distilled examples, this training is 21\u00d7 cheaper in FLOPs than directly tun- ing a 32B target model (R1-distill-32B). Overall, the cumulative data and compute requirements of our pipeline remain well below those of fully fine- tuning large models, while still delivering substan- tial accuracy gains. 5.2 Comparison with Training-Free Baselines A natural question is whether existing training- free techniques are sufficient to elicit long CoTs, or if specialized methods are required.

While these approaches increase verbosity, their accura- cies are generally lower and can even degrade, whereas THINKLOGIT consistently produces longer reasoning that delivers the best performance. contrasts our approach against two such base- lines. First, the budget-forcing heuristic introduced by Muennighoff et al. (2025) replaces the end-of- sentence token with a placeholder string like \u201cWait\u201d to artificially increase output length. Although this yields longer completions, the gains are limited compared to our method, indicating that mere ver- bosity does not translate into deeper reasoning.5 Second, inserting a single long CoT exam- ple in the prompt (sampled from the s1.1-1K dataset (Muennighoff et al., 2025)) for in-context learning (ICL; Brown et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2024) also degrades performance de- spite longer outputs from the target model. In con- trast, THINKLOGIT uses logit-level guidance from a small reasoning model to steer the decoding to- 5For budget forcing, we report results using Qwen2.5-32B- Instruct, since applying it to the base Qwen2.5-32B led to low-quality outputs and degraded performance. This choice is consistent with the setup in Muennighoff et al. (2025). 5 AIME2025 AMC23 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Avg@8 +4.7 +1.3 +3.2 +2.0 Qwen2.5-72B (Target) R1-distill-1.5B (Guider) Target + ThinkLogit Target + ThinkLogit-DPO (Transfer from 32B) Figure 3: Avg@8 for eliciting long CoT in a 72B target model with our methods.

This shows that our improvements stem from the qual- ity of the guidance being applied, rather than the quantity of tokens generated. 5.3 Generalization Across Scales and Families A key strength of our framework is that once trained, a small reasoning guider can be reused far beyond its original training setting. First, pref- erence signals learned", "from the qual- ity of the guidance being applied, rather than the quantity of tokens generated. 5.3 Generalization Across Scales and Families A key strength of our framework is that once trained, a small reasoning guider can be reused far beyond its original training setting. First, pref- erence signals learned on smaller targets gener- alize to larger models within the same family. As shown in Figure 3, a guider optimized on Qwen2.5- 32B outputs transfers effectively to Qwen2.5-72B, where the DPO-trained variant (THINKLOGIT- DPO) still outperforms the vanilla THINKLOGIT. Second, the guider can also be applied to tar- get models from different families. Although logit arithmetic typically assumes a shared tokenizer, we overcome this constraint by aligning vocabular- ies with a minimum edit distance mapping (Wan et al., 2024). In practice, this is a one-time, offline step that introduces no inference overhead. Us- ing this strategy, we guide Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with the R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. As shown in Ta- ble 2, both THINKLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO improve accuracy over the Llama baseline, with THINKLOGIT-DPO yielding a larger +5.5 point gain. The guided models also produce substantially longer CoTs. Manual inspection of their outputs confirms the emergence of self-correction behav- iors such as \u201cWait, no.

Together, these results highlight the broad ap- plicability of our approach: a single specialized guider can be reused for larger models within or across families, offering a scalable way to unlock long reasoning without retraining each target. 6 Additional Analyses 6.1 Emulating Reinforcement Learning with THINKLOGIT RL with verifiable rewards is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of lan- guage models (Lambert et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024), but it is often prohibitively expensive. For example, training even a small 1.5B model with RL for long reasoning can require thousands of GPU hours (Luo et al., 2025a), an expense that becomes prohibitive for large-scale models. Table 3 shows that THINKLOGIT enables the emulation of RL effects on a large target model without training it. First, we simulate a Zero-RL (applying RL di- rectly on a base model; DeepSeek-AI et al.,", "of GPU hours (Luo et al., 2025a), an expense that becomes prohibitive for large-scale models. Table 3 shows that THINKLOGIT enables the emulation of RL effects on a large target model without training it. First, we simulate a Zero-RL (applying RL di- rectly on a base model; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025) pipeline to enhance a large non- 6 reasoning model, Qwen2.5-32B. We apply reason- ing from the One-Shot-RLVR-1.5B (Wang et al., 2025) guider, which is RL-trained on only one ex- ample from a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B base. Second, we simulate an SFT-then-RL pipeline to further improve an already supervised fine-tuned reason- ing model like R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. We apply guidance from the DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview (Luo et al., 2025a) guider, which is trained via dis- tributed RL from an R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B SFT base. Both emulated pipelines deliver consistent performance gains over the target large model and RL-trained small guiders, while avoiding the pro- hibitive cost of applying RL training directly to the large target model. This confirms that our method is an orthogonal technique that can directly benefit from advances in small-model post-training (e.g., distillation or RL), offering a flexible and efficient mechanism to transfer the benefits of powerful but expensive training paradigms to larger models. 6.2 Ablation Study of THINKLOGIT-DPO To further investigate the design choices in THINKLOGIT-DPO, we ablate both our mixed-pair data construction and preference-based learning ob- jective (DPO) against single-source or supervised fine-tuning alternatives. Results in Table 4 answer the following research questions. Are preference pairs sourced from both the tar- get and the guider necessary to maximize perfor- mance? We construct the same amount of 10K preference pairs using only the guider\u2019s correct vs. incorrect outputs, i.e., (x, yS\u2713, yS\u00d7). DPO on this data underperforms markedly on AMC23 (58.8 vs. 63.7 by our THINKLOGIT-DPO), confirming that mixing pairs which highlight both the target\u2019s and guider\u2019s strengths is crucial for maximal gains. Is training on both types of pairs necessary for the effectiveness of THINKLOGIT-DPO? We next ablate by training on only one type of pref- erence pairs at a time: using only Type-2 pairs (x, yS\u2713, yL\u00d7) (i.e., \u03bb = 0 in Equation 2) yields an avg@8 of 57.2, while using only Type-1 pairs (x, yL\u2713, yS\u00d7) (i.e., \u03bb = 1 in Equation 2) drops further to 51.9. Both are substantially below the 63.7 achieved by the full mixture, indicating that both Type-2 pairs (which teach the guider to cor- rect target errors) and Type-1 pairs (which enforce preservation of the correct reasoning of the target) provide complementary signals necessary for better alignment.

Our dual-source, mixed-pair DPO performs the best, demonstrating the necessity of complementary preference signals and preference-based alignment. Can supervised fine-tuning replace prefer- ence-based alignment of the guider? We eval- uate SFT against DPO by training the guider on three equally sized sets of high-quality comple- tions: Option 1: the target model\u2019s correct out- puts yL\u2713; Option 2: the guider\u2019s own correct out- puts yS\u2713(also known as rejection-sampling fine- tuning (Yuan et al., 2023)); Option 3: R1-distilled completions yR1\u2713. Although SFT on Options 1 and 2 makes the guider a stronger standalone reasoner, none of these variants match the performance of the DPO-aligned guider. This gap highlights that optimizing with pairwise preference comparisons yields a better guider than optimizing solely for cor- rectness. While SFT on Option 3 adapts the guider toward the target\u2019s short CoT reasoning style and thus reduces the distributional gap, it also tends to overwrite the guider\u2019s native strengths of long reasoning. In contrast, DPO preserves the guider\u2019s intrinsic reasoning capabilities while selectively aligning it to the target\u2019s preferences through pair- wise comparisons. 6.3 Inference-Time Scaling Properties Scaling the number of generations at test time is a well-established strategy to improve reasoning per- formance (Brown et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024), as drawing more samples increases the likelihood of finding a correct solution. To quantify this ef- fect, we use the pass@k metric (Chen et al., 2021), which measures the probability that at least one 7 1 4 8 16 k 10 20 30 40 50 Pass@k AIME2025 Target + ThinkLogit-DPO Target + ThinkLogit R1-Distill-1.5B (Guider) Qwen2.5-32B (Target) Figure 4: Inference-time scaling on AIME2025.

Figure 4 plots pass@k for k = 1\u201316 on AIME2025, the bench- mark where the 32B target performs weakest and scaling effects are most pronounced. Both THIN- KLOGIT and THINKLOGIT-DPO exceed the tar- get\u2019s pass@16 accuracy with only four samples, representing a fourfold improvement in sample effi- ciency. The gap further widens as k increases: at k = 16, the DPO-aligned guider surpasses the tar- get by roughly 17 points. These results demonstrate that inference-time guidance consistently improves reasoning and that the gains compound with larger sampling budgets. 6.4 Impact of Key Hyperparameters In THINKLOGIT, two hyperparameters play a crit- ical role: the warm-up length T and the guidance strength \u03b1 (Eq. 1). We evaluate their effects on the AMC23 benchmark, which presents a suitable mix of problem difficulties and clearly exhibits both stability and", "larger sampling budgets. 6.4 Impact of Key Hyperparameters In THINKLOGIT, two hyperparameters play a crit- ical role: the warm-up length T and the guidance strength \u03b1 (Eq. 1). We evaluate their effects on the AMC23 benchmark, which presents a suitable mix of problem difficulties and clearly exhibits both stability and guidance effects. To assess warm-up, we vary T over {0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000} with \u03b1 fixed to 1 (Figure 5). When T=0, guidance is applied from the first decoded token, which empiri- cally leads to more repetitions, lower output qual- ity, and the lowest accuracy. Allowing 50\u2013200 to- kens of unguided generation stabilizes the chain-of- thought, improving accuracy over both target and guider models.

With T fixed at 100, we sweep \u03b1 over {0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5} to control how strongly the guider\u2019s delta-logits modify the target\u2019s distri- bution (Figure 6 in Appendix B). At \u03b1=1.0, we observe the highest avg@8 together with moderate generation length, indicating an optimal trade-off between the guider\u2019s corrective signal and the tar- get model\u2019s own priors. Crucially, all experiments in earlier sections except this hyperparameter study use the same hyperparameters (T=100 and \u03b1=1.0) as a robust default, demonstrating that our method achieves strong performance without extensive hy- perparameter tuning. 7 Conclusion We present THINKLOGIT, a training-free, decoding-time framework for eliciting long chain-of-thought reasoning in large non-reasoning models through logit-level guidance from a much smaller reasoning model. Its enhanced variant, THINKLOGIT-DPO, leverages preference optimization to align the guider with the target model, achieving stronger improvements. Across five reasoning benchmarks, our approach delivers up to 29.1% relative accuracy gains using a guider 21\u00d7 smaller than the target. THINKLOGIT demonstrates that a single guider can generalize across target models of different sizes and architectures, while also emulating the benefits of reinforcement learning through the reuse of small RL-trained guiders. Overall, our results establish 8 inference-time guidance as a practical and flexible alternative to costly post-training, opening a path toward modular reasoning systems where small, specialized models can endow large frozen models with advanced reasoning capabilities.

Table 5 in Ap- pendix B compares the inference efficiency of THINKLOGIT with the frozen target alone. De- ploying THINKLOGIT requires hosting the large target together with two smaller models, the base model S0 and the DPO-aligned guider S. In our primary setup (a 32B target guided by a 1.5B model), this increases the total parameter count by about 1.1\u00d7 relative to the target alone, while still fitting on the same number of GPUs. Profil- ing on NVIDIA L40S GPUs shows a moderate slowdown of roughly 25% fewer tokens per second compared to the target in isolation. THINKLOGIT- DPO does not introduce any extra overhead, since it simply replaces the guider in THINKLOGIT with a preference-optimized model of identical size. The observed throughput reduction stems from our pro- totype implementation, which queries the three models sequentially at each decoding step. In a production environment, logits from all three mod- els can be computed concurrently across distributed GPUs. This would largely mitigate the slowdown, making the throughput, in principle, comparable to that of the target model alone. Limited Domains of Evaluation. Our experi- ments focus on math- and science-oriented reason- ing tasks. A broader evaluation suite, including coding (Jimenez et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2025), planning (Zheng et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2024), and tool-use (Huang et al., 2024; Patil et al., 2025), is needed to understand failure modes that may emerge in less structurally similar settings. Offline Alignment. The guider is aligned with the target via Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) on a fixed set of preference pairs. This offline formulation cannot adapt once deployment uncovers new error patterns or distribution drift. In- corporating online reinforcement learning (Schul- man et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2024) that updates the guider from streamed on-policy samples could, in principle, reduce this brittleness. However, on-policy RL introduces training efficiency and stability challenges that remain open research prob- lems. References Bradley C. A.

Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frame- works and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM- based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation- accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller- parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts. Impact Statement\u2014To our knowledge, NL2GenSym is the first framework to achieve a successful end-to-end integration of LLMs with SOAR. It comprehensively covers the entire pipeline, from framework design to robust experimental imple- mentation and validation. Through its novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism, the framework not only translates natural language directly into executable symbolic rules but also This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62306329), the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2023JJ40676), the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) Youth Talent Supporting Program (Grant No. 2024-JCJQ-QT-034), and Independent Innovation Foundation of National University of Defense Technology (Grant No. 24-ZZCX-JDZ-50).

INTRODUCTION T HE pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has long been a central goal in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Cognitive Architectures (CAs) have emerged as foundational tools for this endeavor [1], [2]. By emulating human cognitive processes((e.g., learning, reasoning), CAs provide unified frameworks for developing general intelligent agents [3], [4]. As exemplified by SOAR [5], their integration of structured knowledge representation, explicit reasoning, and adaptive learning (e.g., chunking [6]) have been proven advantageous in complex problem-solving, cognitive simula- tion, and agent behavior generation [7], [8]. However, CAs including SOAR require rules to be coded in their specialized symbolic languages, which poses a significant hurdle for users. Traditional manual coding process is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also demands extensive experience and deep domain knowledge. Furthermore, It becomes even less feasible when tackling novel tasks for which no prior knowledge or expertise exists. In recent years, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought revolutionary breakthroughs to the field of AI [9], [10], [11]. Pre-trained on massive text cor- pora, LLMs have acquired powerful natural language under- standing, generation and learning capabilities, demonstrating impressive performance on a variety of tasks [12], [13], [14]. Consequently, LLMs offer the potential to efficiently gen- erate symbolic rules directly through natural language inter- action. Researchers have begun to explore leveraging LLMs to empower SOAR, aiming to construct more robust and general AI systems. For instance, Laird et al. [15] explored the potential integration of Transformers as a learning and memory component of SOAR. Kirk et al. [16] identified three conceptual integration patterns for using LLMs as knowledge sources in cognitive systems. Wu et al. [17] presented the arXiv:2510.09355v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 2 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020 design and development process for an ACT-R/SOAR model utilizing LLMs as interactive interfaces. While these works predominantly concentrate on conceptual framework develop- ment and integration pattern proposals, often accompanied by only preliminary experiments. At present, robust experimental validation is largely absent, and as a result, the field has yet to see established, impactful results from LLM-assisted cognitive architecture modeling. This presents the following key challenges for realizing the potential of LLM-empowered SOAR: 1) Existing theoretical frameworks for LLM-SOAR inte- gration lack robust experimental validation, as the clash between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the deter- ministic syntax of SOAR hinders their practical viability.

This presents the following key challenges for realizing the potential of LLM-empowered SOAR: 1) Existing theoretical frameworks for LLM-SOAR inte- gration lack robust experimental validation, as the clash between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the deter- ministic syntax of SOAR hinders their practical viability. The first challenge is therefore how to successfully transition from the traditional manual coding approach towards the automated generation of executable sym- bolic rules from natural language. 2) While generating executable rules addresses the initial barrier of entry, it does not guarantee their efficiency. The second challenge is therefore how to facilitate continuous optimization of generated rules and the emer- gence of novel, high-performance rules. To tackle these challenges, we propose Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that effectively integrates LLMs with SOAR to enable the au- tomated generation and continuous optimization of executable symbolic rules from natural language. NL2GenSym operates through a closed-loop, Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism, comprising an LLM-based Generator and a re- flective LLM-based Critic. Both modules leverage a self- evolving domain knowledge base via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [18], [19]. We construct this knowledge base to provide essential SOAR syntax, semantics, and a dynamically updated cases pool enriched by optimal \u201cseed\u201d rules from SOAR execution. The Generator first translates natural language into symbolic rules, which are immediately executed in the SOAR environment to provide execution- grounded feedback. The Critic then analyzes this feedback to generate targeted guidance, enabling iterative rule refinement in subsequent cycles. Our work provides a tangible and viable solution to effec- tively integrate LLMs with SOAR. The technical contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 1) Execution-Grounded, Closed-Loop Framework for Integrating LLMs with SOAR. We introduce a novel framework that automates the generation of executable SOAR rules directly from natural language descriptions. This is achieved through our core execution-grounded generator\u2013critic mechanism. By doing so, our frame- work fundamentally lowers the barrier to using SOAR, empowering users without SOAR-specific expertise to effectively utilize the system. 2) Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base and Reflec- tive Critic Module. To operationalize our framework, we design and implement two core technical compo- nents: (1) The Domain Knowledge Base is comprised of two critical elements. The first is a repository of foundational knowledge, including essential SOAR syn- tax, semantics and examples, which we have specifically structured to ensure the LLM adheres to SOAR; The second is the dynamic case pool. This pool automatically accumulates optimal \u201cseed\u201d rules from successful execu- tion cycles, providing the Generator with a continuously improving repository of high-quality exemplars. (2) The Critic Module analyzes detailed execution traces from SOAR to generate structured, interpretable natural lan- guage feedback. This feedback is crucial for guiding the Generator toward effective and efficient rule refinement. 3) Robust Experimental Validation and Emergent Ca- pabilities. We provide the first robust, end-to-end exper- imental validation of an LLM-SOAR integration. Our results demonstrate that NL2GenSym not only achieves a high success rate (>86%) in generating function- ally correct rules but, more importantly, facilitates the emergent discovery of novel, high-efficiency heuristic rules.

Our results demonstrate that NL2GenSym not only achieves a high success rate (>86%) in generating function- ally correct rules but, more importantly, facilitates the emergent discovery of novel, high-efficiency heuristic rules. This leads to a significant performance improve- ment: solving steps are reduced to near-optimal levels (1.98\u00d7 the theoretical optimum), while outperforming baseline methods by a factor of 1000. Furthermore, the framework enables smaller-parameter models to surpass their larger counterparts, highlighting that well-designed architectures can outweigh sheer model scale. The remaining sections of this paper are outlined as follows: Section II provides theoretical background. Section III intro- duces our proposed NL2GenSym framework in detail. Sec- tion IV presents a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results. Subsequently, Section V discusses the limitations of our current approach, Section VI reviews related work in the field. Finally, in Section VII, we conclude this paper and discuss directions for future work. II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Problem Space Computational Model (PSCM) It is a general theory of decision-making and problem-solving pro- posed by Newell et al. [20]. The core idea of this model is that an agent\u2019s behavior manifests as a series of decision- making processes, utilizing its available knowledge to select appropriate actions (i.e., \u201coperators\u201d) to transition from an initial state to a goal state within a \u201cproblem space\u201d. The SOAR cognitive architecture is built upon the principles of PSCM, providing a concrete computational implementation for this theoretical framework [1], [2]. PSCM emphasizes understanding and constructing intelligent behavior through states, operators, and search, where knowledge is used to guide operator selection and the construction and navigation of the problem space. SOAR Cognitive Architecture SOAR delineates the relation- ships between states, operators, and results. Conceived as an architecture for \u201cuniversal intelligence\u201d, the principal research focus is on exploring knowledge, cognition, intelligence, and memory as they manifest in human cognitive processes [1]. SOAR supports such intelligent behavior through a series of fixed computational mechanisms and structures, with its basic yuan et al.: NL2GENSYM: NATURAL LANGUAGE TO GENERATIVE SYMBOLIC RULES 3 composition typically including interacting memory modules and computational processes [2], as illustrated in Figure 1. Fig. 1: Basic architecture of the SOAR cognitive model [2]. Figure 1 shows the structure of SOAR, which consists of interacting task-independent modules. Working Memory (WM) maintains an agent\u2019s situational awareness, including perceptions, goals, reasoning states and so on. Long-Term knowledge is stored in three memories. These include proce- dural memory (\u201cif-then\u201d knowledge); semantic memory (facts about the world and the agent); and episodic memory (memo- ries of experiences). Procedural knowledge drives behavior by responding to the contents of WM and making modifications to it. Automatic learning mechanisms are associated with procedural and episodic memories [2], [21]. The solving process of SOAR entails a continuous cycle of selecting operators, applying operators, and changing states until the desired goal is attained. This iterative procedure is commonly referred to as the \u201cdecision cycle\u201d [22]. It solves problems through the activation of production rules, offering a foundation for interpretable, human-like decision-making.

This iterative procedure is commonly referred to as the \u201cdecision cycle\u201d [22]. It solves problems through the activation of production rules, offering a foundation for interpretable, human-like decision-making. When SOAR encounters insufficient knowledge during its decision-making process (e.g., inability to select a unique operator, or unresolvable conflicts between multiple operators), an \u201cimpasse\u201d arises [23]. At this point, SOAR automatically creates a substate or subgoal, and within this substate, it employs the same decision cycle to attempt to resolve the im- passe. This recursive, goal-driven problem-solving mechanism is key to the ability of SOAR to exhibit human-like deliberative behavior. Theoretically, this nesting of substates can proceed indefinitely, greatly enriching cognitive capabilities. Decision Cycle Case Study We use the Water Jug Problem (WJP) as a case study, with its problem space comprehensively visualized in Figure 2. Then, we elaborate on the five execution phases of the decision cycle, as detailed in Figure 3: 1) Input phase. This phase processes data and adds that information to the associated buffers in WM. For the WJP, this involves representing the initial state in the jugs, e.g., (0, 0) for two empty jugs, and the target goal is 1 L. 2) Elaboration phase. This phase is where rules fire that elaborate the situation, propose operators, and evaluate operators. For example, within the WJP, rules would 1,0 1,3 0,1 5,1 0,0 Step1 Step2 Step3 Step4 Step5 Fill(3) Pour 3 to 5 Pour 3 to 5 Fill(3) Fig. 2: Problem space representation of the WJP. Each square (x, y) represents a state, corresponding to the water volume in the 5 L and 3 L jugs, respectively. The initial state (0,0) is denoted by the blue square, and a target goal state (any state containing 1 L) is indicated by the green square. The colored arrows depict the state transitions performed by dis- tinct Operators. These Operators include Fill (jug) (to fill a jug to its volume), Empty (jug) (to empty its contents), and Pour (jug from, jug to) (to pour water between jugs until the source is empty or the destination is full). The path highlighted by dashed arrows illustrates the optimum solution, corresponding to five decision cycles in SOAR. propose the fill, empty, and pour operators, and assign preferences of acceptable (+=), better (+>), and worse (+<), respectively. 3) Operator Selection phase. SOAR then selects one op- erator from the proposed candidates based on their preferences. In the WJP, if the fill (j) operator receives the highest (e.g., \u201cbest\u201d or uniquely \u201cbetter\u201d) preference value among all proposed operators, it would be priori- tized for selection. If no operator is uniquely preferred, SOAR automatically creates a substate or subgoal to resolve the impass. Once an operator is definitively chosen, either directly or through impasse resolution, it is designated as the current operator for the next phase. 4) Application Phase. The selected current operator is executed. Specific apply rules for this operator fire, modifying the state in WM. For the", "to resolve the impass.

For the WJP operator fill (j), an apply rule would update volume of j jug to its contents (e.g., 5 L), transforming state (0, 0) to (5, 0). 5) Output phase. Once the application phase completes, the output phase sends any structures created in buffers to their respective modules. After the output phase, processing returns to the Input Phase. For the WJP, the system then re-enters the Input Phase with the new state (e.g., (5, 0)), ready to evaluate and select subsequent operators like pour (j, i). 4 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020 Input phase Elaboration phase Operator Selection phase Application Phase Output phase <j> ^volume 5 ^contents <jcon> <i> ^volume 3 ^contents <icon> <goal> ^contents 1 Proposal & Evaluation 1.<s> ^operator <o> + = <o> ^name empty ^empty-jug <j> 2.<s> ^operator <o> +> <o> ^name fill ^fill-jug <j> 3.<s> ^operator <o> +< <o> ^name pour ^fill-jug <j> 2.<s> ^operator <o> +> <o> ^name fill ^fill-jug <j> state <s> ^name water-jug ^operator <o> ^jug <j> <o> ^name fill ^fill-jug <j> <j> ^volume <volume> ^contents <contents>) --> <j> ^contents <volume> <contents> - <j> ^volume 5 ^contents 5 <i> ^volume 3 ^contents 0 Fig. 3: The decision cycle in SOAR. III. METHOD In this section, we detail the NL2GenSym framework that operates within a closed loop feedback to facilitate iterative rules generation and refinement. We begin by elaborating on the design and operational workflow of its core Execution- Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. Following this, we present the detailed construction of the Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base. Finally, we delve into the specific design and implementation of the two key components: the Generator and the Critic modules. A. Overview To effectively integrate LLMs with SOAR for the auto- mated generation and continuous optimization of executable symbolic rules from natural language, we have developed the NL2GenSym framework, illustrated in Figure 4. The framework is architected around two core pillars: a Self- Evolving Domain Knowledge Base an Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The knowledge base furnishes SOAR essential syntax, semantics, and a dynamically updated pool of \u201cseed\u201d cases, forming a critical support structure. The Generator-Critic mechanism then leverages this foundation. Its NL2GenSym-Generator (NGS-G) is responsible for pars- ing high-level natural language instructions and transforming them into structured symbolic rules. These generated rules are then executed within SOAR to rigorously validate their correctness and evaluate their performance. Subsequently, the NL2GenSym-Critic (NGS-C) analyzes these execution outcomes and the performance data, providing optimization suggestions as feedback to guide the iterative refinement of the rules by the NGS-G. These suggestions serve as direct input for subsequent rule generation cycles. B. Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base Despite being trained in vast text corpora on the Internet and thus possessing broad general knowledge, LLMs often exhibit limitations in terms of depth and", "the iterative refinement of the rules by the NGS-G. These suggestions serve as direct input for subsequent rule generation cycles. B. Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base Despite being trained in vast text corpora on the Internet and thus possessing broad general knowledge, LLMs often exhibit limitations in terms of depth and precision when applied to highly specialized domains such as CAs. To bridge this gap and ensure that LLMs can effectively process tasks related to the SOAR and accurately generate the corresponding rules, we have specifically designed and constructed a Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base (in Figure 4a). The Base is structured into two main components: Basic Knowledge Base and Case Knowledge Base. The data sources cover primarily two major categories: \u2022 Official and Academic Resources: These are primarily derived from the official SOAR website1, which includes its extensive tutorials, classic example programs, and published research case studies. \u2022 Generated Data: These data exhibit a \u201cself-evolving\u201d nature, dynamically updated and enriched with high- quality \u201cseed\u201d rules generated through execution cycles. These components systematically provide both the NGS-G and NGS-C with essential background information, detailed operational specifications, and evolving high-quality rule ex- amples. 1) Basic Knowledge Base: The Base is designed to provide foundational theoretical explanations and structural knowledge pertaining, intended to assist LLMs in deepening their under- standing of the SOAR and to facilitate subsequent efficient knowledge retrieval. These contents, which encompass core definitions, operational principles, syntactic specifications, and the functional characteristics of key components along with their interaction mechanisms, are organized into a total of 13 distinct knowledge modules (as detailed in Table IV, Appendix A). The construction process for this Base initially involves the systematic extraction of relevant document resources from the official website, followed by data cleaning and pre-processing. Subsequently, utilizing predefined structured templates and prompts, the processed knowledge data is classified and organized according to knowledge modules and knowledge points/elements. 2) Case Knowledge Base: The Base is designed to provide high-quality rule exemplars, aimed at helping LLMs master rule-coding paradigms and acquire generalizable rule construc- tion techniques. The Base is divided into two sections: the Functional Module and the Complete Case. The Functional Module Section focuses on providing mod- ular rule fragments. These rules are primarily derived from some examples provided by the official website.

Natural language WJP descriptions are processed by NGS-G (b), using the Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base (a) via RAG, to produce symbolic rules. These rules undergo N execution cycles in the SOAR. Comprehensive feedback\u2014including execution traces, performance data, the generated rules, and the original problem description\u2014is then analyzed by NGS-C (c), which also leverages the Knowledge Base (a) via RAG. The NGS-C (c) outputs natural language optimization suggestions that are fed back to NGS-G (b). Additionally, the case knowledge is iteratively updated by storing currently optimal historical cases from SOAR execution as high-quality \u201cseed\u201d rules within the Knowledge Base (a). the WJP has various strategic approaches, including basic operational rules, such as the Fill operator detailed in Table I, policy optimization using Reinforcement Learning, Look- Ahead Search and Chunking mechanism. We deconstruct and organize these rules based on core functionalities, forming a collection of 22 distinct categories of independent, reusable functional modules. This organizational approach is intended to enable LLMs to understand and learn how to flexibly apply mechanisms of SOAR to construct solutions, thereby enhancing the richness and diversity of paths explored when generating novel rules.

The Complete Case Section aims to provide executable rule exemplars, with a core focus on demonstrating the complete problem-solving process and rule organization structure from an initial state to goal achievement. Notably, this section is a continuously self-optimizing memory pool. During the operation of framework, the cases within this pool are iter- atively updated: currently optimal historical cases identified from SOAR execution are curated as high-quality \u201cseed\u201d rules and integrated back into this section of the Knowledge Base (the iteration process can be seen in Figure 4a). This section stores a series of evolving rule cases, denoted as: Ccases = {(Ri, ei)}N i=0 (1) - Ri denotes rules capable of completely solving the target problem, which, for i > 0, is generated by the NGS-G in the i-th iteration. - ei is the performance evaluation metric obtained after executing the rules Ri, such as the number of decision cycles required to complete the WJP (a lower value typically indicates superior rule performance). - When i = 0, (R0, e0) represents the initial case. These R0 are typically sourced from standard problem-solving solutions provided by the official source or predefined by domain experts. These rules serve as the foundational input during its initial inference (cold-start phase), aiming to substantially improve the ability of framework to generate effective and structurally valid complete rules during the initial stages, 6 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020 TABLE I: Functional Module Rule example. This rule ex- emplifies the fill operator functional module. It comprises two components: the propose rule and the apply rule, which together define a complete operator lifecycle. The propose rule identifies if the current state meets the preconditions for activating the fill operator. Subsequently, the apply rule defines the specific actions of operator: setting the content volume of a designated jug to its maximum capacity, thereby altering the system state. Functional Module Rule: Fill Operator sp{water-jug*propose*fill (state <s> \u02c6name water-jug \u02c6jug <j>) (<j> \u02c6empty > 0) \u2212\u2212> (<s> \u02c6operator<o> +=) (<o> \u02c6name fill \u02c6fill-jug <j>)} sp{water-jug*apply*fill} (state <s> \u02c6name water-jug \u02c6operator <o> \u02c6jug <j>) (<o> \u02c6name fill \u02c6fill-jug <j>) (<j> \u02c6volume <volume> \u02c6contents <contents>) \u2212\u2212> (<j> \u02c6contents <volume> <contents> -)} thereby mitigating the inherent uncertainty and inefficiency associated with the cold-start problem. C. NL2GenSym-Generator NGS-G (in Figure 4b) translates natural language problem descriptions (x) into executable SOAR symbolic rules (R). To optimize rule generation accuracy and efficiency, we design a comprehensive multi-source LLM prompt containing the following key components: 1) Task Instructions and Structured Template (Ptask): A predefined structured prompt template that incorporates specific task instructions. It serves to clearly define the generation objective while standardizing the structure of rules for compliance with SOAR syntax. 2) Retrieval-Augmented Domain Knowledge (rretrieved): The RAG mechanism retrieves Base Knowledge Base and Functional Module content highly relevant to prob- lem x, equipping the LLM with necessary domain context. 3) Optimal Historical Cases (coptiaml): From the Equation 1,", "objective while standardizing the structure of rules for compliance with SOAR syntax. 2) Retrieval-Augmented Domain Knowledge (rretrieved): The RAG mechanism retrieves Base Knowledge Base and Functional Module content highly relevant to prob- lem x, equipping the LLM with necessary domain context. 3) Optimal Historical Cases (coptiaml): From the Equation 1, we select one or more complete rule sets that exhibited optimal performance in prior iterations as coptiaml, based on predefined performance metrics ei (e.g., minimizing the number of decision cycles). These high-quality suc- cessful cases are injected into the prompt as few-shot cases. For the initial rule generation, the initial cases R0 from Ccases are used as contextual input. 4) Optimization Suggestions from NGS-C (Sopt): Natural language feedback generated by the NGS-C to guide rule refinement. The generation process and content specifi- cations of these suggestions are detailed in Section III-D. Therefore, during the generation phase, the generated rules R by NGS-G can be mathematically represented as follows: R = NGS-G(x, Ptask, rretrieved, coptiaml, Sopt) (2) This design enables NGS-G to dynamically leverage the accumulated knowledge and historical optimal data within the framework, thereby generating more precise and task- compliant rules. D. NL2GenSym-Critic NGS-C (in Figure 4c) evaluates the rules R generated by NGS-G through a multidimensional analysis framework and subsequently produces optimization suggestions Sopt. The design leverages a customization prompt for LLMs, based on multi-dimensional information analysis, which empowers the NGS-C to conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted assessment for the generated rules. Primary inputs include: 1) Structured Evaluation Template (Pcritic): Utilizing a pre-designed template, NGS-C is directed to evaluate across specific dimensions (e.g., correctness, complete- ness, efficiency, redundancy, readability, and adherence to SOAR best practices), generating structured outputs of evaluation results and optimization suggestions. 2) Relevant Knowledge Context (rretrieved): Reference in- formation retrieved via a RAG mechanism from the Basic Knowledge Base and the Functional Module, specifically for the currently generated rules R. 3) Execution Trace (Texec): Detailed procedural data gen- erated when the rules R are executed within SOAR, sequence of changes in WM, and impasses generation and resolution processes. This trace provides NGS- C with a micro-level perspective to analyze dynamic behavior and potential issues within the rules. 4) Performance Metrics (ei): Performance indicators (e.g., ei as described in Section III-B2, such as task success rate, total decision cycles, and runtime) provide a macro- level foundation for assessing the overall utility and efficiency of the rules. Therefore, during the evaluation phase, the optimization suggestions generated by NGS-C can be expressed in the following form: Sopt = NGS-C (x, Pcritic, R, r\u2032 retrieved, Texec, ei) (3) This design enables continuous learning through feedback, progressively enhancing rule accuracy. Ultimately, NGS-C drives closed-loop optimization within NL2GenSym by trans- forming evaluation insights into actionable refinements for NGS-G. IV.

An ablation study is then conducted to assess the impact of individual components. Furthermore, representative case studies demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate novel and efficient symbolic rules. A. Experimental Setup 1) Dataset: Many complex, real-world planning tasks are conceptualized as search processes within a problem space, which is a foundational paradigm in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. The WJP serves as a canonical example of such tasks, providing a mathematically tractable abstraction of planning and reasoning challenges. As detailed in Section II, we previously formalize problem space of the WJP and its execution through SOAR decision cycles. In our experiments, we use natural language descriptions of the WJP as inputs. The typical formulation [24] follows: The problem is to deliver a specific amount of water using opaque containers that have no graduated markings. The amount of water that needs to be delivered will generally differ from the full capacities of the containers. As a specific example, how can you bring exactly 1 L of water from the river when you have only two containers, a 3 L jug and a 5 L jug, to measure with? For clarity of exposition, we formally define a WJP case as (V1, . . . , Vn \u2192Vgoal)/Min.DC. Here, V1, . . . , Vn represent the contents of n jugs (with n = 2 for the classic WJP), all initially empty. Vgoal denotes the target content of water to be measured in one of the jugs. Min.DC denotes the minimum decision cycles required to achieve this target state, with the initial state counted as the first decision cycle. Evidently, an increase in Min.DC is known to cause a super-linear expansion of the problem space, significantly ele- vating complexity of the problem. To evaluate the generaliza- tion capabilities of our framework under varying complexities and structural differences, we also include a WJP variant involving three jugs (n = 3). Based on these considerations, we construct a WJP dataset comprising 100 distinct cases. These cases are stratified into four distinct categories based on difficulty level, as determined Min.DC: 25 easy (within 5 steps), 25 medium (between 5 and 10 steps), 30 hard (over 10 steps but not exceeding 20 steps), and 20 variant (with n = 3). Table V in Appendix B contains all 100 cases. 2) Evaluation Metrics: The experimental evaluation em- ploys Success Rate (SR) and Decision Cycles (DC) metrics, inspired by recent approaches [25], [26]. SR, the primary measure of correctness, quantifies the ability of framework to transform natural language descriptions into executable symbolic rules. Specifically, it is the percentage of the 100 cases successfully converted. DC measures efficiency by cap- turing the number of decision cycles. For each successfully generated rules, we execute it 100 times in SOAR and record the", "the ability of framework to transform natural language descriptions into executable symbolic rules. Specifically, it is the percentage of the 100 cases successfully converted. DC measures efficiency by cap- turing the number of decision cycles. For each successfully generated rules, we execute it 100 times in SOAR and record the Average Decision Cycles (Avg.DC) as the quantitative efficiency metric. To provide a benchmark for evaluating Avg.DC, we define the minimum number of decision cycles required to solve each problem instance, averaged across cases, as Average Minimum Decision Cycles (Avg.Min.DC). 3) Baseline Methods: To comprehensively evaluate the ef- fectiveness of our framework, we design three baseline exper- iment categories for comparative analysis. All symbolic rules generated by these baselines and NL2GenSym are executed uniformly within SOAR, with execution results meticulously recorded. 1) Manual Encoding. Establishes a fundamental benchmark using simple and basic symbolic rules crafted manually. This represents traditional rule-based problem solving. 2) LLM Zero-Shot. Evaluates the inherent capability of LLMs to translate natural language task prompts di- rectly into executable symbolic rules without exemplars. Assesses novel rule generation potential without prior examples. 3) LLM One-Shot. Enhances zero-shot generation by incor- porating a single exemplar (identical to Manual Encod- ing rules) with the task prompt. Measures the ability of LLMs to improve rule quality and efficiency through contextual guidance. B. Implementation details All experiments in this paper are conducted on a laptop. It is equipped with an i9-13980HX CPU and an GeForce RTX 4060, running Windows 11. To reinforce the practical imple- mentation of our work, we elucidate the following aspects: 1) Manual Rules. The manual encoding rules employed in the Manual baseline represent a fundamental, non- optimized rule set. Crucially, this same rule set serves dual purposes: as the exemplar case for the LLM- OneShot experiment, and as the initial case for our proposed framework\u2019s experiments. 2) Execution Termination and Failure Adjudication. Ex- periments reveal that rules with high minimum cycle requirements (Avg.Min.DC > 10) exhibit heightened susceptibility to infinite execution loops. These cases compromise both practical runtime feasibility and com- parative analysis validity. We therefore implement a strict termination protocol: any execution exceeding 500,000 decision cycles without achieving the target state (e.g., 1L in 5L jug) is terminated and record as a failure. 3) RAG Implementation Details. Our RAG implementation uses DPR dual encoders [27] with FAISS indexing [28] for efficient retrieval from the Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base. For each query (NGS-G/NGS-C), we retrieve top-5 chunks from the Basic Knowledge Base and top-10 chunks from the Functional Module Section, augmenting the LLM prompts accordingly. 4) LLMs Configuration. Model selection prioritized state- of-the-art capabilities based on Hugging Face\u2019s Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. We select top-ranked representa- tive Gemini and Qwen series models.

Specific versions and temperature configurations are provided in Table VI, Appendix B. C. Comparisons with Baselines To assess the efficacy of the proposed NL2GenSym frame- work, we conduct a comparative analysis against three estab- lished baselines. This evaluation primarily focuses on two key performance metrics detailed in Section IV-A2: Success Rate (SR) and Average Decision Cycles (Avg.DC), with compre- hensive results summarized in Table II. Building upon these findings, we subsequently analyze the mechanisms driving the observed phenomena. 1) Manual Baseline Performance Analysis: The Manual Encoding method achieves success in easy, medium, and variant cases but exhibits markedly low execution efficiency. Its Avg.DC consistently far exceeds the Avg.Min.DC: on the overall dataset, the former is typically over 1000\u00d7 greater than the latter; even for easy cases, Avg.DC often exceeds Avg.Min.DC by more than 10\u00d7. This efficiency bottleneck becomes critical in hard cases, where the method frequently fails due to exceeding the computational limit (500,000 deci- sion cycles, as detailed in Section IV-A3), resulting in an SR of only 46.67%. Experimental data for the Manual Encoding baseline reveal a sharp increase in decision cycles with rising case com- plexity. This directly reflects core problem-solving mechanism of SOAR: abstraction as search within a problem space. Consequently, as the minimum required decision cycles (i.e., the optimal steps) increase, the problem space expands super- lineally. This exponential growth causes traditional manual encoding methods to fail in converging to solutions within acceptable timeframes for complex problems. Performance consequently becomes critically dependent on: (1) developers\u2019 depth of domain-specific knowledge, and (2) their understand- ing of problem-space intricacies. Performance improvements require iterative manual", "problem space expands super- lineally. This exponential growth causes traditional manual encoding methods to fail in converging to solutions within acceptable timeframes for complex problems. Performance consequently becomes critically dependent on: (1) developers\u2019 depth of domain-specific knowledge, and (2) their understand- ing of problem-space intricacies. Performance improvements require iterative manual optimization, which constitutes a labor-intensive process with poor scalability. These limitations expose fundamental scalability and adaptability constraints while highlighting prohibitive knowledge engineering barri- ers and human capital requirements. 2) LLMs (Zero-Shot & One-Shot) Baseline Performance Analysis: In zero-shot experiments, the employed LLMs con- sistently fail to translate natural language descriptions into executable symbolic rules. The introduction of an exemplar in one-shot experiments yield discernible improvements in task comprehension, elevating SR to 55%\u201366%. However, this performance gain prove insufficient for hard cases, where SR declines to as low as 20%. More critically, successful one-shot executions fail to improve efficiency, with Avg.DC maintaining parity with manual baseline performance. Experimental data from LLM baselines validate their profi- ciency in natural language understanding yet reveal significant limitations when applied to domains requiring specialized structured knowledge. This challenge originates in their core design: as sequence transducers and probabilistic predictors, LLMs rely on statistical correlations rather than formal logic [29]. Consequently, when generating outputs demanding strict syntax and operational logic (e.g., SOAR rules), these models frequently produce non-compliant or ineffectively ex- ecutable results [30]. yuan et al.: NL2GENSYM: NATURAL LANGUAGE TO GENERATIVE SYMBOLIC RULES 9 3) NL2GenSym Framework Performance Analysis: NL2GenSym demonstrates robust capabilities in both generating executable rules from natural language and optimizing their efficiency. The framework achieves 86%+ SR across the WJP dataset, indicating strong capacity for producing syntactically correct and structurally complete rules. Compared to the One-Shot baseline, NL2GenSym shows >25% SR improvement overall, with particularly notable gains (56.67% increase) on hard cases using Gemini models. In rule optimization, NL2GenSym significantly outperforms all baselines. While manual and LLM methods exhibit Avg.DC orders of magnitude above optimal levels, our framework consistently constrains Avg.DC within 2\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC. In hard cases, efficiency improves further as the framework achieves an Avg.DC consistently lower than 1.5\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC. The performance superiority of NL2GenSym originates in its architectural design, which overcomes limitations of direct LLMs generation and manual encoding. Significant SR improvements derive from: (1) RAG-enabled Self-Evolving Domain Knowledge Base that supplies NGS-G with critical SOAR context/exemplars, reducing rule-generation flaws; (2) The NGS-C, through its closed-loop interaction with SOAR execution, validates rules and provides targeted natural lan- guage feedback for iterative correction and integrity enhance- ment. The iterative Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic opti- mization cycle is also responsible for the remarkable reduction in Avg.DC. NL2GenSym facilitates an emergent learning process. In this process, the NGS-C analyzes execution- grounded feedback from the SOAR environment, guiding the NGS-G to discover and internalize novel, high-efficiency heuristic rules. The continuous, data-driven strategy optimiza- tion, largely absent in baseline methods, explains their compar- atively poor efficiency. A detailed analysis of such generative symbolic rules for two representative cases is presented in Section IV-E, further substantiating this emergent optimization capability. 4) The Potential of NL2GenSym to Mitigate Model Scale Dependencies:", "The continuous, data-driven strategy optimiza- tion, largely absent in baseline methods, explains their compar- atively poor efficiency. A detailed analysis of such generative symbolic rules for two representative cases is presented in Section IV-E, further substantiating this emergent optimization capability. 4) The Potential of NL2GenSym to Mitigate Model Scale Dependencies: A key finding stems from an experiment highlighting the power of structured guidance: We com- pare our NL2GenSym framework using the smaller-parameter model (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) to the standard one- shot prompting baseline using the significantly larger Gemini- Pro model (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25). As Table II demon- strates, a performance inversion occurs. Despite its smaller scale, the Gemini-Flash model guided by our framework achieves 86% SR and near-optimal reasoning efficiency (1.76\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC). This significantly surpasses the re- sults from the larger Gemini-Pro using one-shot prompting, which achieves only 55% SR with an efficiency of 2500\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC on the overall dataset. This outcome reveals that the performance leap is not solely attributable to model scale but significantly stems from the structured guidance of the NL2GenSym architecture. The Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic optimization cycle ef- fectively overcomes the inherent limitations of smaller models. Crucially, this finding (while preliminary) suggests that for problems requiring verifiable, structured symbolic outputs, a well-designed neuro-symbolic framework can be more impactful than sheer model scale. It therefore highlights a promising path towards developing high-performance, more efficient, and accessible AI systems, offering an attractive alternative to the widespread reliance on resource-intensive ultra-large-scale models. D. Ablation Study To evaluate the contribution of core components in our NL2GenSym framework, we conduct ablation studies on three key elements: (1) the Basic Knowledge Base, (2) the Case Knowledge Base (with initial case intentionally retained to ensure a foundational baseline, as LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot settings\u2014see Section IV-C), and (3) the NGS-C. Ex- perimental configurations are detailed in Table VI, Appendix B, with ablation results present in Figure 5 and Table III. We find that the ablation of the NGS-C exerted the most substantial impact on performance of the framework. The removal of the Critic yields the most pronounced decrease in SR, with a 23% reduction observed across the overall dataset. Concurrently, its Avg.DC increases markedly, ex- ceeding 1,000\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC. Furthermore, this SR degra- dation proves especially acute for challenging and variable cases, where the SR drops by 37%. This result underscores the pivotal importance of the feedback mechanism driven by the NGS-C. This mechanism comprehensively evaluates the entire rule generation lifecycle\u2014from initial inputs and generated rules to SOAR execution traces and performance metrics\u2014while providing targeted refinement guidance. This end-to-end evaluation proves fundamental for optimizing final solution quality. Without this effective feedback loop, the NGS-G consistently struggles to autonomously produce novel, high-quality symbolic rules. Ablating the Basic Knowledge Base yields a less severe SR impact than removing the NGS-C, yet still causes a notable performance decline\u2014manifested by a 17% SR reduction. In decision efficiency metrics, the absence of the Basic Knowl- edge Base does not reduce Avg.DC, maintaining values around 1,000\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC. Critically, however, this foundational domain knowledge gap hinders the learning of effective opti- mization strategies. These results collectively underscore", "causes a notable performance decline\u2014manifested by a 17% SR reduction.

Critically, however, this foundational domain knowledge gap hinders the learning of effective opti- mization strategies. These results collectively underscore the role of Basic Knowledge Base as the essential cornerstone for symbolic rule construction. Similarly, ablating the Case Knowledge Base yields a comparable SR reduction of 14%, even when retaining the initial case. Moreover, the absence of experiential guidance from the Case Knowledge Base diminishes solution space exploration efficiency, with Avg.DC remaining unoptimized at approximately 1,000\u00d7 Avg.Min.DC. These results collectively confirm the efficacy of case-based learning and experience transfer in accelerating and refining symbolic rule discovery. In summary, these ablation studies affirm that the Basic Knowledge Base, Case Knowledge Base and the NGS-C operate not merely as additive components but as synergis- tic elements. The Basic Knowledge Base provides essential SOAR-specific grounding that improves rule correctness; the 10 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020 Case Knowledge Base offers crucial experiential guidance to accelerate effective pattern discovery; and the NGS-C drives iterative refinement necessary for both error correction and high-efficiency heuristic generation. Together, these compo- nents form an indispensable triad that underpins efficacy in rule generation and achieved efficiency in problem-solving within the NL2GenSym framework. 91.00 96.00 92.00 87.00 90.00 77.00 88.00 80.00 63.33 80.00 74.00 84.00 84.00 56.67 75.00 67.00 80.00 68.00 50.00 75.00 0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 80.00 100.00 Overall easy medium hard variant SR (%) EvoNL2Sym wo Basic Knowledge Base wo Case Knowledge Base wo EvoNL2Sym-Critic Fig. 5: Results of ablation studies for Success Rate (%) metrics.

Representative Case Studies Our experimental findings demonstrate that NL2GenSym framework can effectively generate and optimize problem- solving strategies through its iterative process. This leads to the emergence of novel optimization methods that significantly enhance solution efficiency. To illustrate this capability, we present an analysis of two representative cases. The detailed optimization suggestions formulated by NGS-C and the cor- responding generated rules are provided in Appendix C. Case 1: Using the Gemini model for problem (7,9\u21921)/13 (Case 70), the strategy generated by the framework in the 17th iteration optimizes the average decision cycles to 17.5 (1.35\u00d7). This strategy integrates rules for calculating the distance between the current state and the goal state, as well as rules for predicting the resultant states after operator execution (e.g., fill, empty, pour). Crucially, it leverages these predictions to prohibit transitions to previously visited state configurations, thereby effectively pruning the search space. Concurrently, it employs a goal-oriented heuristic to prioritize operators capable of achieving the target state in a single step. Case 2: Using the Qwen model for problem (4,9\u21922)/11 (Case", "empty, pour). Crucially, it leverages these predictions to prohibit transitions to previously visited state configurations, thereby effectively pruning the search space. Concurrently, it employs a goal-oriented heuristic to prioritize operators capable of achieving the target state in a single step. Case 2: Using the Qwen model for problem (4,9\u21922)/11 (Case 53), the strategy generated in the 9th iteration optimizes the average decision cycles to 13 (1.18\u00d7). This strategy employs a heuristic-based operator proposal and preference selection mechanism, assigning differential preference levels to various operations: e.g., prioritizing filling the smaller capacity jug, as- signing neutral preference to \u201cpour\u201d operations, and discourag- ing the emptying of the larger capacity jug. This well-designed preference hierarchy guides the decision-making mechanism towards more promising solution pathways, thereby reducing ineffective exploration of suboptimal branches. Furthermore, this strategy further prunes the search space by explicitly rejecting invalid operations (e.g., attempting to empty an already empty jug), eliminating irrational action sequences. These cases concretely illustrate the capacity of NL2GenSym to autonomously discover diverse and sophisticated heuristics, from direct search-space pruning (e.g., \u201cvisited-state avoidance\u201d) to strategic preference setting. This ability is particularly promising for real-world engineering applications, as these emergent strategies mirror fundamental efficiency principles such as preventing redundant operations in logistics or design processes. V. DISCUSSION While NL2GenSym demonstrates significant efficacy, we acknowledge several limitations that warrant discussion. Firstly, our validation on the WJP, a well-defined theoretical task, may not fully capture the complexities of real-world ap- plications, which often involve ambiguous problem statements and noisy, dynamic contexts. Bridging this theory-to-reality gap is a critical next step. Secondly, the iterative nature of our Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic loop, while powerful, incurs substantial computational costs and does not always yield a linear or monotonic improvement in rule quality. This highlights a core challenge in optimizing the efficiency and predictability of the refinement process. Finally, while NL2GenSym enables LLMs to generate functional SOAR rules, the depth of their genuine comprehension of the under- lying principles of SOAR remains an open question. Although our case studies demonstrate the potential of the framework to produce optimized and interpretable heuristics, a more comprehensive analysis is required to fully substantiate this capability across a broader range of problems. VI. RELATED WORK LLMs for Cognitive Architectures The advent of LLMs [31], [32], [33] has revitalized CAs by offering novel solutions for knowledge acquisition and human-like interaction [34]. Re- searchers are actively integrating LLMs with CAs like SOAR and ACT-R in several key ways. One approach employs LLMs as \u201cfront-ends\u201d or \u201cknowledge augmentation modules\u201d: Laird et al. [15] further proposed integrating Transformers, trained online using an agent\u2019s experiences, as a novel learning and memory component within a CA like SOAR, aiming to learn context-sensitive, similarity-based predictive knowledge from internal agent experiences rather than just external language. Kirk et al. [16] investigated LLMs as external knowledge sources, with their STARS strategy analyzing, repairing, and selecting LLM responses to acquire knowledge consistent with an agent\u2019s context. Wray et al. [24] explored using LLMs yuan et al.: NL2GENSYM: NATURAL LANGUAGE TO GENERATIVE SYMBOLIC RULES 11 to translate natural language problem descriptions into semi-", "investigated LLMs as external knowledge sources, with their STARS strategy analyzing, repairing, and selecting LLM responses to acquire knowledge consistent with an agent\u2019s context. Wray et al. [24] explored using LLMs yuan et al.: NL2GENSYM: NATURAL LANGUAGE TO GENERATIVE SYMBOLIC RULES 11 to translate natural language problem descriptions into semi- formal problem space specifications, thereby assisting CAs in establishing initial task models. Another significant direction utilizes LLMs for higher-level reasoning and planning within CA-driven systems. Yao et al. [35] proposed ReAct framework for synergizing reasoning and acting in large language models. Liu et al. [36] developed GM-Agent, where LLMs process textualized world models and utilize generative memory for task planning. Sharma et al. [37] presented a novel Voice in Head (ViH) framework, that integrated LLMs and the power of semantic understanding to enhance robotic navigation and interaction within complex environments. Zargarzadeh et al. [38] proposed a multi-modal LLM integration in robot- assisted surgery for autonomous blood suction. These research showcased the potential of LLMs as abstract \u201cthinkers\u201d and \u201cplanners\u201d. Furthermore, LLMs are being explored to as- sist in CA model development itself, Wu et al. [17], [39] demonstrated their use as conversational interfaces for ACT- R/SOAR model creation, highlighting the necessity of iterative prompting and debugging due to LLM challenges with CA- specific syntax/semantics, and proposed prompt patterns for improved interaction. While prior works primarily use LLMs to assist CAs, our framework integrates the LLM at a deeper level, empowering it to generate the core executable logic of the CA. Crucially, this integration is not one-way; it forms a closed-loop where execution feedback from the CA drives the iterative refinement of the generative process in the LLMs. This approach moves beyond mere augmentation, enabling emergent discovery of optimized cognitive strategies. LLMs for Symbolic Knowledge Generation The remark- able generative capabilities of LLMs have spurred significant interest in their application to symbolic knowledge generation, extending beyond natural language text to more structured domains such as semantic parsing [40], [41]. While con- ventional approaches often relied on fine-tuned generative models paired with grammar-based parsers for symbolic out- puts [42], [43], recent efforts increasingly leverage LLMs directly. For instance, Wang et al. [44] presented CodeT5, an identifier-aware unified model that excels at generating code by understanding its semantics. Another line of work employs LLMs to generate synthetic data containing symbolic knowledge to train other models. Considering the difficulty in designing grammar to sample useful symbolic forms in complex domains, Yang et al. [45] assumed access to an unlabeled corpus of symbolic language, which was represented in canonical forms, and simulates natural language inputs via LLMs. Rosenbaum et al. [46], with their CLASP method, used an LLM to create data for few-shot cross-lingual semantic parsing, thereby enhancing smaller model performance. These advancements highlighted potential of LLMs in automating the creation of diverse symbolic knowledge, though challenges in ensuring correctness, consistency, and adherence to complex constraints remain critical areas of research. A central challenge in this domain is ensuring the functional correctness and constraint adherence of the generated sym- bols. Our framework directly confronts this by using", "in automating the creation of diverse symbolic knowledge, though challenges in ensuring correctness, consistency, and adherence to complex constraints remain critical areas of research. A central challenge in this domain is ensuring the functional correctness and constraint adherence of the generated sym- bols. Our framework directly confronts this by using the SOAR execution environment itself as a dynamic, post-generation validator. This execution-grounded feedback ensures the gen- erated rules are not only syntactically valid but functionally effective, addressing a key limitation of open-loop or grammar- based generation methods. VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we explore the critical challenges of inte- grating LLMs with SOAR, particularly in achieving a practi- cal, end-to-end solution from natural language to executable symbolic rules. We propose NL2GenSym, a novel framework that, to our knowledge, represents the first successful end- to-end LLM-SOAR integration. It offers a new paradigm for automated problem-solving by enabling direct generation of symbolic rules from natural language, thereby lowering the barrier to SOAR adoption, especially in knowledge-scarce scenarios. Experimental validation on the WJP confirms the generative capacity of the framework. It not only achieves a rule generation success rate exceeding 86%, but also facilitates the emergent discovery of novel, high-efficiency heuristics that reduce decision cycles to near-optimal levels (1.98\u00d7 theoretical optimum). Furthermore, we show that the framework can empower smaller-parameter models to surpass their larger counterparts, highlighting that a well-designed architecture is more critical than sheer model scale. Our work thus offers a viable methodology for autonomously transforming natural language into generative symbolic knowledge, advancing the capabilities of intelligent agents. There are several promising directions for future research based on our work: (1) The WJP serves as a theoretical benchmark, subsequent research requires validation of the framework on practical datasets from domains like logistics planning or robotic task execution to assess real-world utility and robustness; (2) Future work focuses on enhancing iterative learning efficiency through prompt engineering optimization, refinement of domain knowledge bases, and improved RAG in- vocation mechanisms. These enhancements shorten the LLMs iterative learning cycle to address complex tasks with strin- gent timeliness demands; (3) Deepening research into LLM adaptability involves investigating model-adaptive prompting strategies and domain knowledge integration paradigms. These investigations target the varying sensitivities and learning efficacies across LLMs, aiming to enhance universality and optimization effectiveness. REFERENCES [1] A.

The error 'Expected variable or constant for test' in 'water-jug*prefer*closer- to-goal-7L' (and likely its 9L counterpart) indicates an incorrectly placed comparison. Comparisons involving bound variables must be separate condition elements. Suggestions 2: Verify Complete and Error-Free Rule Loading. After correcting the syntax (Suggestion 1), use the 'source' command and meticulously check the output. Ensure the 'Total: XX productions sourced' message reflects the *correct* number of rules (should be significantly more than 28) and, crucially, that *no* error messages (e.g., 'Ignoring production', 'Production addition failed', 'Unknown error') appear. This confirms the core logic is active. Suggestions 3: Implement Robust Impasse Handling. The agent encountered a 'state no-change' impasse leading to an infinite loop. Add rules to explicitly detect and handle common impasses. While the provided rules include detection that halts, consider if more sophisticated handling (e.g., subgoaling for tie/conflict, specific recovery for no-change) is feasible. At minimum, ensure reliable detection and halting for all impasse types ('state no-change', 'operator no-change', 'tie', 'conflict', 'constraint-failure') to prevent infinite loops. Suggestions 4: Strengthen Anti-Looping and Visited State Prohibition. The existing 'water-jug*prohibit*visited-state' and 'water- jug*prefer*worst*...' rules provide backup search control. Verify the canonical representation of state configurations ('^current-config', '^outcome-config') used for visited state checking. Ensure the 'water-jug*record*visited-state' rule correctly captures the *new* state after operator application. Review the 'worst' preference rules (e.g., 'water-jug*prefer*worst*pour-reversal', '...*empty-same-jug-after-fill') to confirm they effectively prevent common immediate loops. Suggestions 5: Ensure Goal Achievement Priority. Operators leading directly to the goal (1L in either jug) should always be selected immediately. Verify that the 'water-jug*best*achieves-goal-*L' rules correctly assign 'best' (>) preference and that this preference overrides all others (heuristic '>' or indifferent '='). Additionally, confirm 'water-jug*reject*empty-goal-jug' reliably", "common immediate loops. Suggestions 5: Ensure Goal Achievement Priority. Operators leading directly to the goal (1L in either jug) should always be selected immediately. Verify that the 'water-jug*best*achieves-goal-*L' rules correctly assign 'best' (>) preference and that this preference overrides all others (heuristic '>' or indifferent '='). Additionally, confirm 'water-jug*reject*empty-goal-jug' reliably prevents actions that would discard the goal once achieved.

Currently, generic acceptable (+) preferences might cause Soar to explore less effective paths repeatedly. - Implementation Idea: For instance, prefer filling the smaller jug (4L) first since it's more likely to reach the target amount in fewer steps when combined with pouring. You can add specific rules to give higher priority to operators that move you closer to the goal. Suggestions 2: Use Reject Preferences for Unnecessary Operations - Description: Add reject (-) preferences to operators when they fail to make meaningful progress towards the goal. This prevents the agent from executing redundant or harmful actions. - Implementation Idea: Reject continuous re-application of 'empty' or 'fill' operators when the jug already contains the desired volume or if the action doesn't bring any value towards solving the problem. Suggestions 3: Utilize Better Conflict Resolution in Operator Selection - Description: Avoid generating multiple valid operators at the same time, which causes excessive ties and conflict resolution issues, leading to longer decision cycles. Ensure that only one optimal operator is selected per step unless necessary. - Implementation Idea: Introduce stricter conditions for proposing operators, ensuring that only those that immediately advance the solution are considered. Adding numeric-indifferent preferences for certain predefined sequences (like alternating between pouring into the smaller jug and filling the larger one) can reduce randomness in operator selection. Suggestions 4: Optimize Memory Augmentation and Elaboration Rules - Description: The cognitive architecture requires frequent updating of the contents of the jugs using elaboration rules ('empty'). These updates increase the WME count significantly and cause inefficiencies in processing. We can optimize these rules by adding constraints to limit their firing only when relevant transitions occur. - Implementation Idea:", "- Description: The cognitive architecture requires frequent updating of the contents of the jugs using elaboration rules ('empty'). These updates increase the WME count significantly and cause inefficiencies in processing. We can optimize these rules by adding constraints to limit their firing only when relevant transitions occur. - Implementation Idea: For example, only update the empty attribute ('^empty') when there\u2019s a significant change in the jug contents rather than every cycle. This will reduce the number of unnecessary rule activations. Suggestions 5: Streamline State Resetting After Goal Completion - Description: There appears to be unnecessary resetting or continual cycling even after a successful completion of the goal. Ensuring that the agent halts efficiently after achieving the goal will prevent additional non-contributing cycles. - Implementation Idea: Use proactive monitoring rules to detect solutions accurately and terminate the agent immediately, preventing further unproductive iterations.

Prior works primar- ily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first sys- tematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our anal- ysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model\u2019s representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which ex- plicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisa- tion. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP lay- ers of the model, while amplifying existing di- rections in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models. 1 Introduction Foundational language models have demon- strated remarkable generalisation and understand- ing across a wide range of tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020). This success has led to extensive research on adapting these models to spe- cific domains, such as legal, medical, or finance, through fine-tuning or continued pretraining. No- tably, domain-adapted models often achieve strong performance with relatively small amounts of do- main data (Houlsby et al., 2019; Garcia-Gasulla et al., 2025; Hui et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a), highlighting their efficiency and transfer capabil- ities. Hence, understanding how domain-specific tuning reshapes these models is crucial for under- standing the internal changes brought by these tech- niques. Such understanding is particularly impor- tant for building trustworthy and reliable systems in sensitive domains (Kumar et al., 2024). Prior research has sought to uncover how finetun- ing affects the representation space of foundational models, revealing that domain adaptation induces structured changes in model parameters and activa- tions. Gururangan et al. (2020) demonstrated that continued pretraining on domain-specific corpora improves downstream performance by altering ac- tivation patterns. Similarly, Merchant et al. (2020) and Zhou and Srikumar (2022) showed that such changes preserve core linguistic features while en- abling the model to learn new features correlated with specific tasks. Ilharco et al. (2022) further introduced task vectors to capture how finetun- ing moves model parameters in a specific task- oriented direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that finetuning encodes domain-specific knowledge. However, these studies have primarily focused on auto-encoder models or smaller models and have not addressed how large language mod- els (LLMs), which are now more widely deployed, are adapted. Further, they primarily focus on per- formance improvement along one axis, for exam- ple improvement in a particular task Ilharco et al. (2022), unlike", "primarily focused on auto-encoder models or smaller models and have not addressed how large language mod- els (LLMs), which are now more widely deployed, are adapted. Further, they primarily focus on per- formance improvement along one axis, for exam- ple improvement in a particular task Ilharco et al. (2022), unlike LLMs\u2019 fine-tuning, which improves their generation quality across multiple axes, such as instruction-following ability, tool integration, benchmark performance, etc. Therefore, a more recent line of research, known as model diffing, focuses on understanding the parametric differences between a pretrained base LLM and its instruction-tuned variant. These stud- ies (Minder et al., 2025; Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) have shown that base and 1 arXiv:2510.09359v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 instruction-tuned models share a significant portion of their encoded features. Lin et al. (2023) anal- ysed the decoding mechanisms of instruction-tuned models, showing that finetuning alters their stylistic choices in response to given instructions. Similarly, Wu et al. (2024) demonstrated that instruction tun- ing modifies the model\u2019s attention patterns, causing it to focus more on the instruction component of the prompt. While these studies uncover several important mechanisms underlying instruction-tuned LLMs, they primarily focus on general-purpose chat mod- els. The rapidly growing ecosystem of domain- specific, specialised LLMs has not yet been sys- tematically studied. To address this gap, we focus on medical language models as a representative use case for examining the effects of domain-specific fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a systematic investigation in this direction. Our initial experiments reveal that domain- specific finetuning alters only a small subset of the model\u2019s representational subspaces. To interpret these changes, we introduce tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by the concept of task vectors. These vectors capture how fine-tuning modifies pretrained representations. We observe that the ab- sence of these vectors leads to models that perform poorly on instruction-following tasks. Further, we utilise these tuning vectors to analyse the differ- ences induced by fine-tuning in pre-trained models. This approach provides a generalised method for understanding the effects of fine-tuning on domain- specific models. We summarise our findings below: 1. Finetuning changes only a small portion of the representational subspaces. Neural activations remain largely consistent between pretrained and fine-tuned models, and their parametric spaces exhibit a high degree of similarity. 2. We define tuning vectors, which are responsi- ble for improving fine-tuned models\u2019 perfor- mance in instruction following, benchmark- ing, and generating higher-quality outputs in domain-specific tasks. 3. Removing these vectors from a model\u2019s para- metric space leads to a deterioration of its performance. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors from different domains results in more generalizable models. 4. We analyse the directions tuning vectors write in pretrained models and find that most new directions are concentrated in the MLP heads. The magnitude of these directions varies across domains. 2 Neural Activation Background: Our analysis begins by examining the activation of feed-forward networks (FFNs) of pretrained, instruction-tuned, and domain-specific medical LLMs, when prompted with medical doc- uments. FFNs play a crucial role in feature ex- traction and", "in the MLP heads. The magnitude of these directions varies across domains. 2 Neural Activation Background: Our analysis begins by examining the activation of feed-forward networks (FFNs) of pretrained, instruction-tuned, and domain-specific medical LLMs, when prompted with medical doc- uments. FFNs play a crucial role in feature ex- traction and non-linear transformation (Geva et al., 2021); they are pivotal for retrieving informa- tion and solving tasks. Therefore, understanding changes in their activation between models can reveal how domain-specific fine-tuning alters the internal computations of an LLM. An FFN at layer l consists of two linear trans- formations separated by a point-wise non-linear activation, which we express as: FFNl(xl) = Act(Wupxl) Wdown (1) where Wup \u2208Rdm\u00d7d, Wdown \u2208Rd\u00d7dm, and Act(\u00b7) denotes a non-linear activation function. Geva et al. (2021) showed that each d- dimensional corresponding rows and columns of Wup and Wdown can be interpreted as a key\u2013value pair whose interaction is responsible for writing information into the residual stream. Consequently, we can view an FFN in layer l as comprising dm neurons, whose activation is determined by Act(\u00b7). In the LLMs with which we experiment, Act(\u00b7) is a variant of the gated linear unit (GLU) (Shazeer, 2020), in which the activation vector is given by A = \u03c3(Wgatexl) \u2208Rdm. The j-th neuron is active if its corresponding activation value aj > 0; this leads to the corresponding key\u2013value interactions to write information into the residual stream. Experimental setup: We analyse eight LLMs from three model families. From the Meta-Llama-3 series, we include three models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Llama3-Aloe-8B-Alpha (Gururajan et al., 2024), and Meta-Llama-3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024); the last one serves as the pretrained model for the first two, and the second model is the specialised medical model. From Qwen2.5, we analyse Qwen2.5-7B- Instruct (Yang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta- 7B (Garcia-Gasulla et al., 2025), and Qwen2.5- 7B (Yang et al., 2024b), where the last serves as the 2 0 10 20 30 Layers 10 20 30 40 50 Activated Neurons (%) Model Family: Meta-Llama-3-8B 0 10 20 30 Layers 0 5 10 15 20 25 Activated Neurons (%) Model Family: Qwen2.5-7B 0 10 20 30 Layers 0 20 40 60 80 Activated Neurons (%) Model Family: Phi-3.5 Meta-Llama-3-8B Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct Llama3-Aloe-8B-Alpha Qwen2.5-7B Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta-7B Phi-3.5-mini-instruct MediPhi Figure 1: Activated neurons across layers. Percentage of activated neurons across layers for the three model families: Meta-Llama 3, Qwen2.5, and Phi-3.5. In all families, the number of activated neurons tends to increase with layer depth. Within each model family, the proportion of activated neurons in a model remains relatively constant across layers. pretrained model for the first two, and the second model is the specialised medical model. From the Phi-3.5 series, we include MediPhi (Corbeil et al., 2025) and Phi-3.5-Instruct (Abdin et al., 2024). Un- like the Qwen and Llama series of models, Phi does not release a base model and also uses the Instruct variant for training the specialised medical model, MediPhi. To extract the neural activation, we utilise doc- uments from the PMC Open Access Subset (Na- tional Library of Medicine,", "2024). Un- like the Qwen and Llama series of models, Phi does not release a base model and also uses the Instruct variant for training the specialised medical model, MediPhi. To extract the neural activation, we utilise doc- uments from the PMC Open Access Subset (Na- tional Library of Medicine, 2003), which is a col- lection of open-access journal articles and preprints from PubMed Central (PMC). For each model, we extract 100M tokens, which are then used to obtain the neural activations. Neuron activation trends. Figure 1 shows the percentage of neurons activated at layer l for the eight models, grouped into their respective model families. Across all models, we observe a sharp drop in activation immediately after the first layer, followed by a gradual increase in later layers, an effect particularly pronounced in the final layers of the LLaMA models. Notably, Phi-3.5 consistently exhibits a substantially higher proportion of acti- vated neurons than the others, which we attribute to its smaller size (3.5B parameters) relative to the 7B+ parameters of the other models. Interestingly, models within the same family tend to have similar proportions of activated neurons at layer l. This is contrary to our expectation that domain-specific medical models would exhibit higher activation levels, as they may possess a larger number of spe- cialised neurons. Effect of neurons on performance. To as- sess the role of these neurons in medical tasks, we ablate them by zeroing their activations in the Qwen 2.5 and LLaMA 3 model families, and evaluate the resulting performance drop across a wide variety of medical benchmarks: BioRed (Luo et al., 2022), CareQA (Arias-Duart et al., 2025), six subsets of MMLU relavent to medical do- mani (Hendrycks et al., 2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), three sub sets of ACI (wai Yim et al., 2023), MEDIQA (Ben Abacha et al., 2019), MedText (Melamud and Shiv- ade, 2019), and MedlfQA (Jeong et al., 2024) (ref. Appendix A.1 for more details). We ablate top 1%, 5%, and 100% of identified neurons and find that this, on average, decreases performance by 20%, 62.6%, and 93%, respectively, for the models (c.f. Figure 5 in the Appendix A.2). Hence, these neu- rons are useful for performing medical tasks. Edit distance between neural activations. Fig- ure 1 shows that similar proportions of neurons are activated at each layer across different vari- ants of LLMs within a family. However, com- parable activation rates do not necessarily imply overlap in the specific neurons being activated. To assess this, we encode dm neurons at layer l in model m as a binary vector, z(l) m \u2208{0, 1}dm, where z(l) m,i = 1[a(l) i > 0], 1[\u00b7] being the indicator func- tion and a(l) i denotes the activation of the i-th neu- ron at layer l. We then compute the normalised edit distance between the pretrained and fine-tuned variants: \u2206(z(l) pt , z(l) ft ) = 1 dm \u00b7 EditDist(z(l) pt , z(l) ft ), with EditDist(\u00b7, \u00b7) denoting the Levenshtein dis- 3 0 10 20 30 Layers 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08", "ron at layer l.

The figure shows the layer-wise normalised edit distance between the pretrained and fine-tuned models for the three model families: Meta-Llama 3, Qwen2.5, and Phi-3.5. We note that the edit distance remains small across layers for all models. tance. This metric directly quantifies how much fine-tuning reconfigures neuron-level activation pat- terns, beyond overall activation proportions. Figure 2 reports the layer-wise edit distance be- tween the pretrained model and its fine-tuned vari- ants. We do not observe a consistent trend across all model families: for LLaMA, the edit distance stays low through early/mid layers and rises sharply in the final layers; for Qwen, it oscillates across depth; for Phi, it shows an early spike followed by a sharp drop, then a gradual increase with moderate fluctuations in mid-late layers and then a drop in final layers. Nevertheless, across all cases, the nor- malised edit distance remains small, indicating that fine-tuning minimally changes the activation struc- ture and suggesting that pretrained model neurons remain largely reusable. To further understand how fine-tuning alters a pretrained model, we compute the cosine similarity between the weights of the pretrained model and its fine-tuned variants. Table 15 in Appendix re- ports the pairwise cosine similarity values, which are consistently high across all families, suggesting that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representation space. To complement these find- ings, we conduct activation patching experiments (Figure 7 in Appendix), which reveal that anal- ogous regions perform similar functions in both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Taken together, these results indicate that fine-tuning induces only marginal changes confined to some small specific subspaces. This observation explains prior findings that feature extractors trained on pretrained mod- els transfer effectively to their instruction-tuned counterparts(Minder et al., 2025). To understand the changes in the subspaces, specifically to un- derstand which subspaces are changed, we draw inspiration from task vectors (Ilharco et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2023) and propose Tuning Vectors, a framework for under- standing subspace changes in fine-tuned LLMs, as described in the following sections. 3 Tuning Vectors Unlike primitive task-specific fine-tuning of mod- els, where the objective was most to improve per- formance on a single task, domain-specific fine- tuning in LLMs, whether via instruction tuning or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), is multifaceted.

The goal may be a com- bination of improving alignment, ensuring privacy, improving multilingual capabilities, domain knowl- edge, trustworthiness, enabling tool usage, or ad- dressing safety concerns. In the context of our study, the objectives of domain-specific fine-tuning can be broadly categorised as follows: 1. Improving performance on domain-specific benchmarks: fine-tuning enhances an LLM\u2019s performance on specialised benchmarks, par- ticularly in narrow domains such as medicine or math, where pretrained models may underperform (see Table 7 in Appendix A.3). 2. Improving generation quality: Beyond accu- racy, fine-tuning also improves fluency, coher- ence, and factual consistency of generations, leading to more reliable outputs (see Table 8 in Appendix A.3). 4 Model Dataset BioRed CareQA Anata Clin Bio Medi Gene Prof MedMCQA MedQA Average Meta-Llama-3-8B Aloe-Alpha 91.00 67.80 64.29 79.31 62.50 72.73 90.91 80.65 54.60 60.60 72.44 (\u2212) TAloe \u03b1 81.20 9.40 21.43 10.34 18.75 18.18 27.27 19.35 20.60 26.00 25.25 Qwen 2.5-7B Aloe-Beta 92.40 72.40 78.57 89.66 87.50 81.82 100.00 77.42 55.40 66.60 80.18 (\u2212) TAloe \u03b2 76.80 65.20 85.71 79.31 81.25 72.73 100.00 74.19 49.40 59.20 74.38 Phi-3.5 MediPhi 91.40 64.80 85.71 72.41 93.75 90.91 100.00 80.65 54.60 59.20 79.34 (\u2212) TMediPhi 87.60 67.20 85.71 82.76 87.50 86.36 100.00 74.19 55.40 62.00 78.87 Table 1: Accuracy on medical-domain text classification and multiple-choice QA tasks.

Enhancing instruction-following ability: In- struction tuning or RLHF specifically aim to align model behaviour with human-like intent, ensuring that the model follows natural lan- guage instructions, which are provided in the prompt (see Table 9 in Appendix A.3). To understand how fine-tuning changes the pre- trained model, we utilise the concept of tuning vectors. Consider a pretrained model with weights \u03b8pre \u2208Rd and a fine-tuned model with weights \u03b8ft \u2208Rd. We define tuning vectors corresponding to the fine-tuned model as Ttuned = \u03b8ft\u2212\u03b8pre. This", "9 in Appendix A.3). To understand how fine-tuning changes the pre- trained model, we utilise the concept of tuning vectors. Consider a pretrained model with weights \u03b8pre \u2208Rd and a fine-tuned model with weights \u03b8ft \u2208Rd. We define tuning vectors corresponding to the fine-tuned model as Ttuned = \u03b8ft\u2212\u03b8pre. This is similar to the concept of task vectors (Ilharco et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2023). However, unlike task vectors, tuning vec- tors are responsible for improving the performance of fine-tuned models along all the axes described above; hence, they are quantified as a group of vec- tors that improve many directions in an LLM. In \u00a73.1, we explain the effect of these vectors, and fi- nally in \u00a74, we uncover what changes these vectors bring to the pretrained model. 3.1 The Effect of Tuning vector Tuning Vector Negation In this section, we demon- strate the importance of tuning vectors in enhancing the performance of fine-tuned models on bench- marks. We demonstrate that negating these repre- sentational spaces from the fine-tuned model re- sults in subpar performance of the model along all three axes discussed above. We perform the nega- tion operation by subtracting the representation of the tuning vector from the fine-tuned model and prompting the resultant model in a similar manner as the fine-tuned model. Table 1 shows the performance of the models on ten medical benchmarks. As is evident, remov- ing the tuning vector reduces the performance of the models. On average, the performance drops by 65% for Llama3-Aloe-Alpha, and 7% for Qwen2.5- Aloe-Beta. For text generation-centric tasks, the performance as noted in Table 2 decreases by 25% and 10% for Llama3-Aloe-Alpha and Qwen2.5- Aloe-Beta, respectively. MediPhi\u2019s performance does not decrease substantially; this may be at- tributed to the fact that its performance was similar to that of its pretrained model in all the medical benchmarks (ref. Tables 7 and 8). To further understand the effect of tuning vector negation on the instruction following capabilities of the model, we evaluate the model\u2019s output for the ten datasets in Table 1. Specifically, we assess whether negating the tuning vector leads to dete- rioration in adherence to the guidelines defined in our system prompt (Appendix A.5). The system prompt instructs models to: 1.

Tables 10, 12, and 11 in Appendix for qualita- tive examples). We attribute this robustness to its use as an Instruct-tuned pretrained model, which also achieves stronger baseline performance than MediPhi.

To investigate how tuning vectors differ by domain, we compute the cosine similarity (formally defined in Appendix A.4) be- tween the tuning vectors of the Qwen2.5 model trained for chat (Yang et al., 2024b), code (Hui et al., 2024), math (Yang et al., 2024a), and medicine (Garcia-Gasulla et al., 2025). Figure 3 presents the similarity heat map. The tuning vectors have low similarity, indicating their limited cross-domain alignment. Notably, medical vs. math/code vectors are completely orthogonal, while code and math, which are more closely re- lated domains (Drori et al., 2022), exhibit a mea- surable degree of similarity. The instruction-tuned vector is not entirely orthogonal with respect to other vectors, suggesting partial transfer across do- mains. Tuning vector addition. Domain-specific training produces specialised models; however, these gains do not transfer effectively across domains. This phenomenon is known as domain shift (Guo and Yu, 2022). For instance, we observe that Qwen2.5- Math-Instruct performs approximately 80% worse on a medical benchmark compared to Qwen2.5- Aloe-beta-7B. Conversely, Qwen2.5-Aloe-beta-7B performs around 23% worse than Qwen2.5-Math- Instruct on the mathematics benchmark. These results highlight the challenge of cross-domain gen- eralisation in large language models. Motivated by this observation, we explore whether it is possible to construct a more generalisable model by simply adding tuning vectors from multiple domains to the parameters of a pre-trained model. Formally, given a pre-trained model with parameters, \u03b8pre \u2208Rd and a set of domain specific tuning vectors, Td, the combined model parameters are defined as: \u03b8new = \u03b8pre + X d Td In our experiments, we evaluate this approach on the Qwen series, constructing models by adding math and medical tuning vectors, constructed from Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Aloe-beta- 7B, respectively. We assess the generalisation performance of the resulting models on a set of domain-specific benchmarks. To facilitate compari- son, we normalise the performance of the combined model by dividing it by the performance of the cor- responding domain-specific models. A normalised score greater than one indicates that combining the tuning vectors improved the model\u2019s perfor- mance over the individual domain-specific model.

Similarly, for three out of the nine math benchmarks, the performance of also improved with respect to the medically fine- tuned model. 4 Tuning Vectors for Interpretation So far, we have understood that pretraining only af- fects a small number of subspaces that are captured by tuning vectors. In this section, we utilise these tuning vectors to understand the changes that are brought about in the internal representation of the pretrained model after training. Subspace Alignment. To quantify what subspaces the tuning vector T amplifies or adds in the pre- trained model\u2019s weight matrix W, we compute its projection onto the top-k subspace of W ob- tained via singular value decomposition (SVD), W = U\u03a3V \u22a4, where Uk \u2208Rd\u00d7k contains the first k left singular vectors (c.f. Appendix A.7 on how we select k). Formally, we define SubSpace Align- ment (SSA) as: SSA = \u2225UkUT k T \u22252 \u2225T \u22252 SSA measures the fraction of the tuning vector in the same direction as the pretrained model. A higher SSA indicates that the vector primarily am- plifies existing directions, while a lower value sug- gests substantial new directions outside the pre- trained subspace. We evaluate SSA of tuning vectors for Qwen2.5- Aloe-Beta-7B and Llama3-Aloe-8B-Alpha with Attention MLP T WQ WK WV WO Wgate Wup Wdown Aloe \u03b1 0.751 0.914 0.971 0.800 0.278 0.281 0.975 Aloe \u03b2 0.805 0.936 0.988 0.818 0.195 0.211 0.987 Q Code 0.906 0.990 0.993 0.870 0.460 0.443 0.997 Q Math 0.877 0.985 0.993 0.840 0.351 0.332 0.995 Table 4: Average SSA scores for Attention components (WQ, WK, WV, WO) and MLP components (Wgate, Wup, Wdown) for T .

Our analy- sis focuses on the fundamental components of the MLP and the attention heads of LLMs. To fur- ther assess the generality of these findings across domains, we additionally analyse tuning vectors from Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math- Instruct. Table 4 reports the SSA scores \u2013 atten- tion components are generally better aligned with the pretrained model than MLP components, sug- gesting that fine-tuning tends to encode more new directions in the MLP subspace. Within attention, we find that the query (WQ) and output (WO) ma- trices exhibit lower alignment than the key (WK) and value (WV ) matrices. This indicates that fine- tuning primarily adds new directions to help the model know what to attend to and what to write back in the residual stream, while the direction", "the query (WQ) and output (WO) ma- trices exhibit lower alignment than the key (WK) and value (WV ) matrices. This indicates that fine- tuning primarily adds new directions to help the model know what to attend to and what to write back in the residual stream, while the direction in keys and values remains similar. In contrast, within the MLP, the gate (Wgate) and up (Wup) projections are substantially less aligned than the down (Wdown) projection. Since gate and up pro- jections determine which features are activated and expanded during the forward pass, this suggests that domain-specific training predominantly injects new knowledge directions through these compo- nents. These findings are true for all four models, implying they are generalisable across model type and domains.

Magnitude change in pretrained model. Here 7 we investigate how much the tuning vector changes the model and if this change is similar through- out all tuning vector types. Inspired from the former results, we decompose the tuning vector into two components: the projection energy on the same subspaces as the pretrained subspace model i.e. \u2225E\u2225\u22252 = \u2225UkUT k T \u22252, and the resid- ual energy lying in orthogonal directions \u2225E\u22a5\u22252 = \u2225(I \u2212UkUT k )T \u22252. Tables 6 and 5 show the en- ergy distribution. Unlike the previous results, we find that the energy distribution varies considerably by domain type. Specifically, tuning vectors of medical models exhibit substantially lower overall energy compared to those of code or math mod- els within the Qwen family. However, similar to our earlier finding, we note that most orthogonal energy is concentrated in Wgate and Wup of MLP, while for other components, the parallel energy is higher, indicating that for them the tuning vector mainly amplifies existing directions.

Attention columns indicate alignment in query/key/value/output projections; MLP columns indicate feed-forward alignment. Beyond sub-space alignment, we also analyse the energy distribution of tuning vectors with re- spect to the pretrained basis. We decompose each tuning update into two components: the projec- tion onto the pretrained subspace, and the residual energy lying in orthogonal directions. Our find- ings show that attention updates carry most of their energy within the pretrained subspace, indicating that fine-tuning primarily re-weights existing direc-", "to the pretrained basis. We decompose each tuning update into two components: the projec- tion onto the pretrained subspace, and the residual energy lying in orthogonal directions. Our find- ings show that attention updates carry most of their energy within the pretrained subspace, indicating that fine-tuning primarily re-weights existing direc- tions. In contrast, MLP updates exhibit a larger proportion of energy in the orthogonal comple- ment, revealing that these layers are the main locus where novel directions are introduced. This decom- position provides further evidence that attention is predominantly refined during adaptation, while MLP layers are the mechanism through which new knowledge is injected into the model. 5 Related Works Task vectors and task arithmetic. Ilharco et al. (2022) proposed task vectors as the difference be- tween the weights of a fine-tuned model and its base model, conceptualising each task as a direc- tion in parameter space. Scaling or composing such vectors enables controlled editing of model behaviour without full retraining. This builds on representation arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) and linear mode connectivity (Frankle et al., 2020; Garipov et al., 2018), suggesting that learned func- tions occupy approximately linear manifolds in weight space. Follow-up studies (Shao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2023; Chat- terjee et al., 2024) examined how task vectors inter- act across layers and tasks, showing that fine-tuning modifies a small, interpretable subset of parame- ters. Task vectors thus provide both a mechanism for modular editing and insight into where task- specific knowledge resides in LLMs. Model diffing analysis. This emerging line of studies shows how LLMs internalise and reorgan- ise knowledge during fine-tuning or instruction tun- ing. Sparse Cross-encoders (Lindsey et al., 2024) demonstrate that cross-layer feature analysis can re- veal complex interactions and the mechanistic foot- print of fine-tuning. Minder et al. (2025) extended this framework, showing that fine-tuned and pre- trained models share many of their features, high- lighting stable representations. Wu et al. (2024) further showed that instruction tuning changes at- tention patterns, focusing the model on instruction tokens. Together, these works highlight model diff- ing as a valuable tool for dissecting how LLMs adapt representations and behaviour in response to new training objectives. 6 Conclusion In this work, we present the first systematic anal- ysis of domain-specific fine-tuning in large med- ical language models, introducing tuning vectors as a framework for interpreting parameter changes induced by domain adaptation of LLMs. Our re- sults show that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, preserving many of the representations of the pretrained model. However, these minimal changes enhance the do- main knowledge, instruction-following behaviour, and generation quality\u2014showing that a few shifts in parameter space can produce significant gains. We further reveal that tuning vectors primarily write new directions into the MLP components (Wgate and Wup) of the network.Our study presents a general framework for analysing LLMs. 8 7 Limitation While our findings provide valuable insights into how fine-tuning alters pretrained models, several limitations remain. Firstly, due to computational constraints, our analysis is restricted to three model families, and", "into the MLP components (Wgate and Wup) of the network.Our study presents a general framework for analysing LLMs. 8 7 Limitation While our findings provide valuable insights into how fine-tuning alters pretrained models, several limitations remain. Firstly, due to computational constraints, our analysis is restricted to three model families, and our initial findings are limited to med- ical models. Secondly, the tuning vectors we com- pute capture static differences between pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, and thus do not directly model the dynamics of fine-tuning or the interme- diate stages of optimisation. Thirdly, as our work primarily focuses on propos- ing Tuning Vectors as a framework, we do not fully explore all of their potential applications. We sum- marise a few promising future directions below: \u2022 Our finding that pretrained and instruction- tuned models exhibit similar neural activa- tions does not consider permutation equiv- ariance (Zhou et al., 2023) in feed-forward layers. Future work can investigate whether these models are even more aligned when such symmetry is taken into account. \u2022 The concept of tuning vectors can be lever- aged to guide domain-specific fine-tuning by training models only along domain-relevant directions. Such a regime can be efficiently integrated into low-rank adaptation methods, similar to the approach of Zhang et al. (2023). \u2022 Our current vector composition strategy (Fig- ure 4) involves simple addition. This can be improved by reducing conflicts between vec- tors and selectively combining directions of interest, incorporating ideas from linear mode connectivity (Frankle et al., 2020). \u2022 Similar to task vectors, tuning vectors can be used to monitor or control the fine-tuning trajectory of domain-specific models (Ilharco et al., 2022). Our study introduces tuning vectors as a new lens for understanding how large language mod- els internalise domain knowledge. By showing that fine-tuning operates through compact, interpretable subspace shifts, we provide a foundation for more modular, efficient, and transparent model adapta- tion. We hope this work sparks future research on using tuning vectors not only as diagnostic tools but also as building blocks for controllable and compositional fine-tuning across domains.

A Appendix A.1 Medical Benchmarks 1. ACI (wai Yim et al., 2023) is a benchmark to assess the clinical note generation ability of an LLM. It contains anonymised conversations between doctors and patients, also providing transcripts from clinical notes that can be used to generate and access automated note-taking LLMs. 2. BioRed (Luo et al., 2022) is a relation extrac- tion dataset derived from PubMed abstracts. It provides annotations for multiple entity types 11 (e.g., genes, diseases, chemicals) and relation types, and uniquely distinguishes between novel and previously known relations, making it useful for both information extraction and knowledge discovery tasks. 3. CareQA (Arias-Duart et al., 2025) is a ques- tion answering dataset in clinical settings. It focuses on patient-care scenarios and medical decision-making, emphasising models\u2019 ability to generate accurate, contextually appropriate answers in real healthcare contexts. 4. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) is a large- scale multiple-choice QA benchmark encom- passing many domains. While it contains many domains, we only utilised the subsets that are relevant to the medical domain. 5. MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022) is a large multiple-choice question answering dataset designed for the medical domain. It covers a wide range of exam-style questions, extracted from AIIMS and NEET PG medical entrance exams. It is useful to test LLMs\u2019 factual recall and reasoning in the medical domain. 6. MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) is derived from multiple-choice QA of medical licensing ex- ams. It evaluates an LLM\u2019s ability to solve real exam questions, requiring both medical knowledge and clinical reasoning skills. 7. MEDIQA (Ben Abacha et al., 2019) is a open-ended clinical QA,dataset. The bench- mark highlights challenges in understanding and reasoning over clinical text in real-world healthcare contexts. 8. MedText (Melamud and Shivade, 2019) is a medical text understanding benchmark fo- cusing on biomedical and clinical corpora. It studies medical domain comprehension, fo- cused on bridging the gap between general NLP datasets and highly specialised medical text. 9. MedlfQA (Jeong et al., 2024) is a open ended QA dataset in medicine. Unlike multiple- choice benchmarks, it emphasises generating detailed, well-grounded, and explanation-rich answers to medical questions, pushing models to go beyond factual recall toward reasoning and justification.\u2019 A.2 Ablate neurons To investigate the contribution of the neurons to model performance in", "al., 2024) is a open ended QA dataset in medicine. Unlike multiple- choice benchmarks, it emphasises generating detailed, well-grounded, and explanation-rich answers to medical questions, pushing models to go beyond factual recall toward reasoning and justification.\u2019 A.2 Ablate neurons To investigate the contribution of the neurons to model performance in the medical domain, we per- formed a neuron ablation experiment. Let a model with parameters \u03b8, and let h(x) denote the average activation for all x \u2208X. In Neuron ablation, we set the activation of se- lected neurons to zero during a forward pass. For- mally, if S \u2286{1, . . . , N} is the set of neurons to ablate, the ablated activation \u02dchi(x) is defined as: \u02dchi(x) = ( 0 if i \u2208S, hi(x) otherwise. S is our setups consists of the top 1%, 5%, and 100% of neurons (selected by h(x)). We evaluate the effect of abalation by measuring the relative decrease in performance after ablating a set S of neurons is: \u2206P = Poriginal \u2212Pablated Poriginal \u00d7 100%. Our results (see Figure 5) show that ablating 1% of neurons reduces performance by 20%, ablating 5% reduces performance by 62.6%, and ablating all neurons results in a 93% decrease. These findings demonstrate that a small subset of neurons carries important medical information. Interestingly, both instruct and medically fine-tuned variants demon- strate greater robustness to 1% ablation compared to their pre-trained model counterparts. We also find that the degree of perfoemnce drop is not uniform among all models. LLaMA-3 is more susceptible to neural ablation than Qwen2.5. Indicating it is less robust to changes in activation patterns. Furthermore, if we compare base and fine- tuned models, we find the fine-tuned models to be more resilient to neural ablation. This is especially true for the LLaMA-3 series. A.3 Benchmarking medical LLMs performance. As suggested in Section 3 we measure the perfor- mance of medical LLMs along three axis: (1) accu- racy on medical benchmarks, (2) quality of open- ended generation, and (3) instruction-following ability. Below, we detail the metrics used for each. \u2022 Accuracy on Medical Benchmarks. We mea- sure factual correctness on multiple-choice and NLU medical datasets such as BioRed, CareQA, six medical subsets of MMLU, 12 MedMCQA, and MedQA. Accuracy is de- fined as: Accuracy = Number of Correct Answers Total Number of Questions \u00d7100 This metric captures improvements in fac- tual reasoning and knowledge retention after domain-specific fine-tuning. \u2022 Quality of Open-ended Generation. We as- sess text generation quality using the ROUGE- 1 metric, which measures unigram overlap be- tween the generated output G and a reference text R. Precision (P), recall (Rc), and F1 score are defined as: P = |G \u2229R| |G| , Rc = |G \u2229R| |R| ROUGE-1 = 2 \u00d7 P \u00d7 Rc P + Rc where |G \u2229R| is the count of overlapping un- igrams between G and R. Higher ROUGE-1 scores indicate that the generated text better aligns lexically with the reference output, re- flecting improved fluency and content fidelity. For this we use the three sub-sets of ACL, MEDIQA, MedText, and", "+ Rc where |G \u2229R| is the count of overlapping un- igrams between G and R. Higher ROUGE-1 scores indicate that the generated text better aligns lexically with the reference output, re- flecting improved fluency and content fidelity. For this we use the three sub-sets of ACL, MEDIQA, MedText, and MedlfQA. \u2022 Instruction-following Ability. To investigate the instruction-following capabilities of the model, we evaluate the outputs of BioRed, CareQA, six medical subsets of MMLU, MedMCQA, and MedQA. Specifically, we assess whether the model\u2019s adherence to the guidelines specified in our system prompt (see Appendix A.5 for system prompt). Our sys- tem prompt instructs the model to: 1. Thought encapsulation: Encapsulate the model\u2019s reasoning between special <THOUGHT> tokens. 2. Valid answer format: Produce the an- swer in the prescribed format. 3. Stop generation: Terminate generation immediately after producing the answer and avoid extraneous output. Tables 7, 8, and 9 shows the performance of variant of Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and Phi-3.5. We note that domain-specific finetuning generally leads to better-performing models along the tree axes. A.4 Cosine Similarity Between Task Vectors Given two task vectors T1 and T2 (each obtained as the difference between fine-tuned and pretrained weights), we quantify their directional similarity using cosine similarity: cos(T1, T2) = \u27e8T1, T2\u27e9 \u2225T1\u22252 \u2225T2\u22252 , where \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9denotes the Frobenius inner product between flattened weight tensors. A higher value indicates that the two fine-tuning directions modify the model in similar representational subspaces, whereas lower values imply orthogonal or task- specific adaptation. A.5 System Prompt We use the following system prompt in benchmark- ing the accuracy of our models. System prompt used. <|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|> You are a highly qualified medical expert, adept at answering complex medical exam questions. Your task is to answer multiple-choice medical exam questions by following a structured reasoning process. You will be given with some examples cu- rated from a database of medical questions and their corresponding solutions. Each example showcases a detailed, step-by-step reasoning process leading to the correct answer. Carefully analyze these examples, paying close attention to the following: * The medical knowledge applied in each step. * The logical flow of reasoning, connecting medical concepts to the question. * The format used to present the reasoning and final answer. Your task is to answer a new medical ques- tion by emulating the reasoning style and format observed in the examples. Follow these instructions carefully: 1. Thoroughly review the examples to inter- nalize the reasoning patterns and solution format. While you should follow the format, DO NOT copy the reasoning verbatim. The idea is to understand how to THINK. 2. Read and understand the question. 3. Articulate your reasoning process inside the <think></think> tags.

B. actin and myosin. C. troponin and tropomyosin. D. myosin and tropomyosin. <think>Actin is a thin filament protein, forming a helical structure along with tropomyosin and troponin, which regulate its interaction with myosin. Myosin, on the other hand, is a thick filament protein characterized by its long tail and globular head. The heads of the myosin filaments form cross-bridges by attaching to specific sites on the actin filaments. Through a se- ries of movements fueled by ATP hydrol- ysis, these cross-bridges pull the actin fila- ments towards the center of the sarcomere, the basic unit of a muscle fiber, causing the muscle to contract. While troponin and tropomyosin are also important in muscle contraction, they serve more as regulatory proteins rather than primary contractile pro- teins.</think> Answer: [B] < |eotid| > A.6 Attribute Patching Attribution patching (Vig et al., 2020) is an inter- pretability technique used to identify which parts of a model (e.g., specific layers, heads, or MLP neu- rons) are causally responsible for a given behavior or", "proteins rather than primary contractile pro- teins.</think> Answer: [B] < |eotid| > A.6 Attribute Patching Attribution patching (Vig et al., 2020) is an inter- pretability technique used to identify which parts of a model (e.g., specific layers, heads, or MLP neu- rons) are causally responsible for a given behavior or prediction.

For the Instruct and Aloe variants, we also identify an additional region near the end- of-input (EOI) token, which may be attributed to differences in their chat template training setups.

However, GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain- of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training stability. 1 Introduction LLMs have significantly advanced mathemati- cal reasoning capabilities by leveraging state- of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) tech- niques. A pivotal advancement in this domain is GRPO, which not only enhances mathemat- ical reasoning performance, but also addresses key limitations of prior methods like Reinforce- ment Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al., 2022), such as memory efficiency, sample utilization, and training stability (Shao et al., 2024). These advantages render GRPO indispensable for the extensive application of LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks. \u2217Corresponding authors: enwang@jlu.edu.cn (En Wang), sudu@ict.ac.cn (Du Su), liuwenbin@jlu.edu.cn (Wenbin Liu), chenfubao@baidu.com (Chenfu Bao), zhonghoulv@baidu.com (Zhonghou Lv) AIME24 AIME25 AMC MATH-500 OMNI-MATH OlympiadBench Minerva Avg. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Performance (Acc@k) w.

Our method, shown as a dashed red line, stands out and remains best or near-best on most tasks, especially on MATH-500, and it also achieves a strong overall performance on average. Despite its advantages, applying GRPO within reinforcement learning (RL) faces chal- lenges in balancing exploration and exploita- tion (the E\u2013E trade-off). (Sutton, 1988). This challenge has driven a prevailing paradigm: existing methods either minimize entropy to yield convergent, credible outputs (Gao et al., 2025; Agarwal et al., 2025), or maximize it to boost exploration\u2014such as DAPO\u2019s decoupled clipping (Yu et al., 2025). Yet such entropy- maximizing or -minimizing approaches are in- herently fragile: on the one hand, these blunt approaches to entropy manipulation lack sta- bility; on the other hand, their inherent flaws without laborious parameter tuning, further manifest as policy entropy collapse (Yu et al., 2025) and model collapse (Chu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). Specifically, a well-established relationship between model performance (R) and policy entropy (H) is de- fined as R = \u2212a\u00b7exp(H)+b (Cui et al., 2025a); this formulation reveals an inherent dilemma: improved performance comes at the cost of reduced entropy (Cheng et al., 2025). To", "et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). Specifically, a well-established relationship between model performance (R) and policy entropy (H) is de- fined as R = \u2212a\u00b7exp(H)+b (Cui et al., 2025a); this formulation reveals an inherent dilemma: improved performance comes at the cost of reduced entropy (Cheng et al., 2025). To ad- dress this inherent trade-off, KL-divergence 1 arXiv:2510.09369v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 has become a prevalent choice. However, KL constraints alone can trigger model col- lapse in CoT reasoning (Chu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), further hindering stable policy learning. Moreover, other existing KL-based solutions\u2014including ProRL\u2019s KL regularization (Liu et al., 2025) and newer Clip-Cov/KL-Cov methods (Cheng et al., 2025)\u2014rely on intricate hyperparame- ters, which often require fine-tuning dynamic- sly tailored to token-level. Core Insight: We argue that these chal- lenges, stemming from high-variance noise ac- cumulation over extended reasoning sequences, are particularly acute in GRPO due to its critic- free nature (Zhang et al., 2025). When discov- ering a novel CoT structures, policies may un- dergo significant divergence from their initial distributions (Cheng et al., 2025). These will incur the accumulation of high-variance noise throughout long CoT sequences, a phenomenon that is further exacerbated by GRPO (Zheng et al., 2025). Notably, entropy regularization alone may cause model collapse (Chu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), fur- ther destabilizing policy optimization. These issues are worsened in GRPO by its critic-free design (Zhang et al., 2025), which lets high- variance noise accumulate in long reasoning sequences. To address these issues, we propose TEPO, a novel framework that leverages Markov Likeli- hood (Chung, 1967) to adapt entropy control and connect group-level reward with token- level optimization. Our key contributions con- sist of three main components: \u2022 Markov Likelihood and Token Mean Optimization: We use a Markov model to link group-level reward with tokens via token-level aggregation. \u2022 Investigating Entropy Regularization in Critic-Free Paradigms: We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that en- tropy regularization is not a good fit for the critic-free GRPO setting. \u2022 Extensive Experiments: Our method im- proves average accuracy by 2% over baseline GRPO. We also run ablations on entropy regularization and sparse rewards, and the results support the effectiveness of TEPO. Our experiments show that TEPO significantly outperforms existing methods on key perfor- mance metrics such as @k and accuracy, setting new records on mathematical reasoning tasks while maintaining superior training stability. 2 Preliminaries This section lays the theoretical foundation for our method: we derive the policy-entropy gradient to motivate our regularizer, review policy-gradient basics and limits in GRPO. 2.1 Policy Entropy Formulation In LLMs, the state s corresponds to the prompt context, and an action a refers to a token from the vocabulary A. For state is and action a, the policy is defined as follows: \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) = exp(\u03d5\u03b8(s, a)) P a\u2032\u2208A exp(\u03d5\u03b8(s, a\u2032)), which is a softmax function. Here, \u03d5\u03b8(s, a) \u2208 R is the score (the token logit), and \u03b8 = {\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) | s \u2208S, a \u2208A} collects all scores. The entropy of", "action a, the policy is defined as follows: \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) = exp(\u03d5\u03b8(s, a)) P a\u2032\u2208A exp(\u03d5\u03b8(s, a\u2032)), which is a softmax function. Here, \u03d5\u03b8(s, a) \u2208 R is the score (the token logit), and \u03b8 = {\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) | s \u2208S, a \u2208A} collects all scores. The entropy of policy distribution \u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | s) measures its uncertainty: H (\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | s)) = \u2212 X a \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s). Applying the chain rule yields: \u2202H \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = \u2212 X a \u0014 \u2202\u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) +\u03c0\u03b8(a | s)\u2202log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) \u0015 . The partial derivatives are given by: \u2202\u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = ( \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) (1 \u2212\u03c0\u03b8(a | s)) , a = ai \u2212\u03c0\u03b8(a | s)\u03c0\u03b8(ai | s), a \u0338= ai , \u2202log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = ( 1 \u2212\u03c0\u03b8(ai | s), a = ai \u2212\u03c0\u03b8(ai | s), a \u0338= ai . Substituting these derivatives yields the follow- ing compact entropy-gradient expression: \u2202H \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = \u03c0\u03b8(ai | s) (log \u03c0\u03b8(ai | s) + H (\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | s))) . (1) 2 2.2 Policy Gradient for LLMs Alignment We study RL fine-tuning for language models on verifiable tasks (RLVR) (Lambert et al., 2024), which aims to maximize a rule-based reward A(y) = r(y) (Williams, 1992) : max \u03b8 J(\u03b8) := Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(x) [A(y)] , (2) where x \u223cD is the input prompt, and y = {y1, . . . , yT } is the generated sequence of length T. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) improves training sta- bility by using a clipped important sampling: L(\u03b8) = Et \u0014 min \u0012 \u03c0\u03b8(yt | y<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yt | y<t)At, clip \u0012 \u03c0\u03b8(yt | y<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yt | y<t), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5 \u0013 At \u0013\u0015 , (3) with \u03f5 controls the clipping range. The policy gradient components are derived as: \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = E\u03c0\u03b8 \u0014\u2202log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) A(s, a) \u0015 . Plugging in the softmax gradient gives the basic policy gradient: \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) = \u03c0\u03b8(ai | s) (A(s, ai) \u2212E\u03c0\u03b8 [A(s, a)]) , (4) where E\u03c0\u03b8 [A(s, a)] = P a \u03c0\u03b8(a | s)A(s, a). 2.3 Limitations of Current Approaches Methods like RLOO (Kool et al., 2019) and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) apply group-level normalization to cut variance while keeping training stable. We sample K responses per prompt and compute the advantage as follows: At = r (y) \u2212mean \u0010 r \u0010 y1:K\u0011\u0011 std (r (y1:K)) . (5) However, these methods still struggle to bal- ance exploration and exploitation, because group-level advantages are not suitable for sentence-level and token-level scenarios. 3 Methodology This section presents our proposed method. We first analyze the limitations of GRPO in entropy utilization, then derive our theoreti- cal framework, and finally present the formal objective function and algorithm. Figure 2: Clip Ratio over Steps 3.1 Limitations of Entropy Regularization in GRPO 3.1.1 Policy Ascent Formulation At step k, starting from the current policy \u03c0k, we get the next policy \u03c0k+1 by solving the following constrained", "our theoreti- cal framework, and finally present the formal objective function and algorithm. Figure 2: Clip Ratio over Steps 3.1 Limitations of Entropy Regularization in GRPO 3.1.1 Policy Ascent Formulation At step k, starting from the current policy \u03c0k, we get the next policy \u03c0k+1 by solving the following constrained problem for each state s: max p Ea\u223cp [A(s, a)] \u2212\u03b7 \u00b7 KL (p\u2225\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s)) subject to P a p(a | s) = 1. Using a Lagrangian view, these policy update methods lead to an iterative update rule written as: \u03c0k+1(a | s) = \u03c0k(a | s) exp (\u03b7A\u03c0(s, a)) Ea\u2032\u223c\u03c0k(\u00b7|s) [exp (\u03b7A\u03c0(s, a\u2032))]. (6) More concretely, the normalized update is: \u03c0k+1(a | s) \u221d\u03c0k(a | s) exp \u00121 \u03b7A\u03c0(s, a) \u0013 . The update keeps the stability benefits of KL- regularized policy optimization while maximiz- ing expected return: \u03b8k+1 s,a = \u03b8k s,a + 1 \u03b7A\u03c0(s, a). (7) This \u03b7 stabilizes the training process while counteracting policy ascent(Williams, 1992; Kakade, 2001; Schulman et al., 2015, 2017; Guo et al., 2025). Many studies show that strong policy learning needs sufficient explo- ration. When trying new CoT patterns, the policy can drift far from its starting distribu- tion. In fact, using only a KL constraint can cause model collapse (Chu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), making stable training harder. 3.1.2 Entropy-Policy Gradient Misalignment Lemma 3.1.

We analyze the inner product between entropy gradient and policy gradient: \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9= X ai \u2202H \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai) \u00b7 \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, ai). Plugging in the entropy gradient (Eq. 1) and the policy gradient (Eq. 4) gives: \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9 = X ai \u03c0\u03b8(ai|s)2 (log \u03c0\u03b8(ai|s) + H(\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|s))) A(s, ai). Case 1: Suboptimal Actions. If the ad- vantage is negative (A(s, a) < 0): \u2022 Small probability \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u21920 implies log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u2192\u2212\u221e \u2022 The term log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s)+H(\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | s)) becomes negative \u2022 With \u03c0\u03b8(a | s)2 > 0, A(s, a) < 0, and the logarithmic term negative, each product term is positive Thus: \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9> 0. Case 2: Optimal Actions. If the advan- tage is positive (A(s, a) > 0): \u2022 Large probability \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u21921\u2212implies log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s) \u21920\u2212 \u2022 The term log \u03c0\u03b8(a | s)+H(\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | s)) remains negative \u2022 With \u03c0\u03b8(a | s)2 > 0, A(s, a) > 0, and the logarithmic term negative, each product term is negative Thus: \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9< 0. 3.1.3 Entropy-Natural Policy Gradient Misalignment Lemma 3.2. The entropy difference \u2206H cor- relates with the gradient inner product: \u2022 When A(s, a) < 0(suboptimal actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9> 0 and \u2206H > 0 (entropy increases). \u2022 When A(s, a) > 0 (optimal actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9< 0 and \u2206H < 0 (entropy decreases).

The policy parameter update follows: \u03d5\u03b8(s, a) \u2190\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) + \u03b1 \u00b7 \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, a), where \u03b1 > 0 is the learning", "actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9> 0 and \u2206H > 0 (entropy increases). \u2022 When A(s, a) > 0 (optimal actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9< 0 and \u2206H < 0 (entropy decreases). Proof. The policy parameter update follows: \u03d5\u03b8(s, a) \u2190\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) + \u03b1 \u00b7 \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, a), where \u03b1 > 0 is the learning rate. Using first-order Taylor expansion (Nocedal and Wright, 2006), the entropy change approx- imates as follows: \u2206H \u2248 X a \u2202H \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) \u00b7 \u2206\u03d5\u03b8(s, a). Plugging in the update rule \u2206\u03d5\u03b8(s, a) = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u2202J \u2202\u03d5\u03b8(s,a) gives: \u2206H \u2248\u03b1 \u00b7 \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9. When A(s, a) < 0(suboptimal actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9> 0 and \u2206H > 0. When A(s, a) > 0 (optimal actions), \u27e8\u2207\u03d5\u03b8H, \u2207\u03d5\u03b8J\u27e9< 0 and \u2206H < 0. This shows that, in no-critic setups, entropy regularization conflicts with policy ascent as Eq. 4. In no-critic setups, adding entropy control can hinder the improvement of final task performance. For example, maximizing entropy requires extensive hyperparameter tun- ing, and KL-Divergence can cause model col- lapse (Zheng et al., 2025). 3.2 Theoretical Analysis of TEPO 3.2.1 E-E Trade-off Analysis Policy Gradient (PG) (Williams, 1992) and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) (Kakade, 2001) keep updates stable and consistent with the KL-Divergence (Schulman et al., 2015): H(\u03c0k+1 \u03b8 | s) \u2212H(\u03c0k \u03b8 | s) \u2248\u22121 \u03b7 \u00b7 Cova\u223c\u03c0k \u03b8 (\u00b7|s) \u0000log \u03c0k \u03b8 (a | s), r(s, a)\u0001 , (8) where the nonnegative covariance term Cov tracks the policy\u2019s step-by-step change. This links small entropy changes to the pol- icy\u2019s covariance structure across updates and articulates how entropy shifts relate to the ex- ploitation policy. This relationship thus reveals the core of exploration and ex- ploitation: balancing the equation\u2019s two sides achieves their optimal trade-off. 4 In GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), we study how policy entropy changes from iteration k to k+1. Given the state distribution (d\u03c0k) induced by \u03c0k, this entropy change decomposes as: H(\u03c0k+1) \u2212H(\u03c0k) = Es\u223cdk+1H(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s)) \u2212Es\u223cdkH(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s)) | {z } State Distribution Shift + Es\u223cdkH(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s)) \u2212Es\u223cdkH(\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s)) | {z } Policy Update Effect \u2248Es\u223cdk [H(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s)) \u2212H(\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s))] , (9) where the approximation Eq. 8 holds under the assumption d\u03c0k+1 \u2248d\u03c0k. However, the required near-stationarity (d\u03c0k+1 \u2248d\u03c0k) is hard to achieve in CoT reason- ing. GRPO uses a no-critic setup. This makes the problem worse. Policy updates can change the policy greatly. This leads to large distribu- tion shifts. And it breaks the approximation. Critic-free GRPO is ill-suited for entropy regularization. Mainly because KL is always non-negative, so it fails to capture small, use- ful reward differences when signals exist only in a few tokens. Increasing entropy leads to more wrong trials and long-term degradation, while decreasing it rapidly erodes diversity and crashes the model. 3.2.2 Markov Likelihood Resolves the E-E Trade-Off In GRPO, the token-level importance weights \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t|x,yi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi,t|x,yi,<t) do not fully reflect how the whole sequence distribution changes. This leads to very noisy (high-variance) gradient estimates and can often cause model collapse that is hard to undo (Zheng et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025). The", "In GRPO, the token-level importance weights \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t|x,yi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi,t|x,yi,<t) do not fully reflect how the whole sequence distribution changes. This leads to very noisy (high-variance) gradient estimates and can often cause model collapse that is hard to undo (Zheng et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025). The main rea- son is that GRPO has no critic (value baseline) and uses only sparse token-level rewards. LLMs generate text one token at a time: each token\u2019s probability depends on prior to- kens (a Markov factorization) (Chung, 1967). Thus, the sequence-level (Markov Likelihood) importance ratio ISi(\u03b8) factors into a product of token ratios: ISi(\u03b8) = \u0012 \u03c0\u03b8(yi | x) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi | x) \u0013 1 |yi| = exp 1 |yi| |yi| X t=1 log \u03c0\u03b8(yi,t | x, yi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yi,t | x, yi,<t) ! , which represents a geometric mean. 3.3 Proposed Method 3.3.1 Objective Function Putting the update rule (Eq. 7) and the entropy\u2013covariance link (Eq. 8) into the PPO loss gives the following joint objective: L(\u03b8) = 1 PG i=1 |oi| G X i=1 |oi| X t=1 min ISi(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai,t, clip (ISi(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03b5, 1 + \u03b5) \u02c6Ai,t ! , s.t. 0 < |{oi | is equivalent(a, oi)}| < G, (10) where the ISi(\u03b8) operates in the backward pass as: \u2202L \u2202\u03c0\u03b8 = \u2202L \u2202ISi \u00b7 ISi \u00b7 maski,t |oi|\u00b7\u03c0\u03b8 . 3.3.2 Computation Graph for the Token Level We use a careful backward pass to keep training stable and consistent with our theory, mainly by handling importance-sampling ratios at both the sequence and token levels. Algorithm 1 Simplified Backward Iteration for Policy Gradient Require: Loss function: L(\u03b8) = 1 total mask PG i=1 P|oi| t=1 ISi(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai,t \u00b7 maski,t Ensure: Policy parameter gradient \u2207\u03b8L(\u03b8) 1: Compute gradient of L w.r.t. total loss sum (sum loss = P i,t ISi \u02c6Ai,t \u00b7 maski,t): 2: \u2202L \u2202sum loss = 1 total mask 3: Propagate gradient to token-level term ISi \u02c6Ai,t: 4: \u2202L \u2202(ISi \u02c6 Ai,t) = maski,t total mask 5: Calculate gradient of importance sampling ratio ISi: 6: \u2202L \u2202ISi = P|oi| t=1 \u02c6Ai,t \u00b7 maski,t total mask 7: Backpropagate to current policy probability \u03c0\u03b8: 8: \u2202L \u2202\u03c0\u03b8 = \u2202L \u2202ISi \u00b7 ISi \u00b7 maski,t |oi|\u00b7\u03c0\u03b8 9: Obtain \u2207\u03b8L(\u03b8) by backpropagating through the policy network. The algorithm follows the gradient in Eq. 10. Here, \u2202L \u2202ISi \u00b7 ISi gives a batch-level signal for each sequence, while maski,t |oi|\u00b7\u03c0\u03b8 gives a sequence- normalized signal for each token. Using the ge- ometric mean in ISi(\u03b8) keeps gradients stable across different sequence lengths and reduces the variance spikes noted in Sec. 3. 3.3.3 TEPO with Empirical Proof Our method addresses these limitations through the following steps: \u2022 Using a Markov Likelihood to connect group- level reward with tokens, which reduces gra- dient bias (see Fig. 2). 5 \u2022 Adopting a token-leveln calculation to en- able token-level policy optimization. \u2022 Maintaining training stability while preserv- ing the ability to explore (see Fig. 3). These results match the known link between performance and policy entropy: (R = \u2212a \u00b7 exp(H) + b) (Cui et al., 2025a). As it notes,", "\u2022 Adopting a token-leveln calculation to en- able token-level policy optimization. \u2022 Maintaining training stability while preserv- ing the ability to explore (see Fig. 3). These results match the known link between performance and policy entropy: (R = \u2212a \u00b7 exp(H) + b) (Cui et al., 2025a). As it notes, optimizing downstream tasks tends to lower entropy; pushing entropy higher rarely helps, and adding a KL term often hurts. The reason is that inCoT, token distributions shift across steps, so entropy and KL affect tokens unevenly and lead to collapse. 4 Experiment 4.1 Experimental Setup Implementation Details. We ran all exper- iments on eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. For each rollout step, we processed 64 prompts per batch and sampled 8 responses per prompt with tem- perature 1.0. The policy was updated 8 times using these responses. To keep training effec- tive, we removed prompts whose sampled re- sponses were all correct or all wrong, following (Yu et al., 2025). Key hyperparameters were: learning rate lr = 5 \u00d7 10\u22127, maximum prompt length max prompt length = 2024, maxi- mum response length max response length = 8192, and training prompt mini-batch size train prompt mini bsz = 16. Datasets. We trained Qwen2.5 models (Yang et al., 2025) on DAPO-MATH (Yu et al., 2025) and evaluated on seven math bench- marks: MATH-500, AIME24/25 (Li et al., 2024), AMC, OMNI-MATH, OlympiadBench, and Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). For AIME and AMC we used temperature 0.6; for the others we used greedy decoding. The maximum generation length was 8192 tokens. AIME, AIME25, and AMC results were re- ported with 32 samples per problem (@32) fol- lowing prior work (Guo et al., 2025; DeepSeek- AI et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2024). Baseline Methods. We compared TEPO with strong baselines. Original GRPO/DAPO (Shao et al., 2024) used the standard formu- lation without extra changes. GRPO/DAPO with Clip-Higher applied an upper threshold \u03f5 = 0.28 in the PPO loss (Yu et al., 2025). Clip-Cov (Cui et al., 2025a) clipped tokens with high covariance (clip ratio r = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124). An entropy-based term (Cheng et al., 2025) added entropy regularization to advantage es- timation with scale \u03b1 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 and clipping parameter \u03ba = 2. For TEPO, we set \u03f5 = 0.2. 4.2 Main Results Table 1 reports results on seven math bench- marks. TEPO attains the best average accuracy at 32.04%, beating all baselines. Compared with GRPO, the average gain is 1.74 points (32.04% vs. 30.30%). The largest gain appears on MATH-500: TEPO reaches 77.20%, a +4.8 point jump over GRPO. This suggests TEPO handles sparse rewards better on hard math tasks. On AIME, it stays competitive, scoring 12.18% on AIME24 and 7.60% on AIME25. Our method performs relatively poorly on the Minerva and OlympiadBench datasets. The core reason is Minerva and OlympiadBench\u2019s strict output formatting, complex answers (un- like other datasets\u2019 0-10000 numerical outputs), and especially LaTeX requirement. These two datasets hurt exploration-oriented methods\u2019 performance, including DAPO/GRPO w.Clip- Higher. Figure 3 presents the training curves.

In Fig. 3a, TEPO achieves steadier and higher re- wards over steps, demonstrating more effective learning. In Fig. 3b, TEPO \u2019s gradient norms are consistently higher, reflecting more active parameter updates. These trends validate our assertion that token-level explicit policy opti- mization delivers finer-grained learning signals. 4.3 Ablation Studies 4.3.1 Analysis of Entropy Regularization Components We ran ablations to study the entropy parts of our method. Table 2 shows the numbers, and Figure 4 shows the training curves. Both maximum-entropy and KL-based reg- ularization hurt performance in our GRPO setup. The maximum-entropy variant low- ers the average accuracy by about 0.39 points (31.65% vs. 32.04%). The KL variant is worse, dropping accuracy by 5.79 points (26.25% vs. 32.04%). We think this happens because these reg- ularizers work best when rewards are dense, but math reasoning gives sparse feedback.

Figure 3: Comparative analysis of TEPO versus DAPO/GRPO w. Clip-Higher training dynamics. The left panel shows reward progression, while the right panel displays gradient norm throughout training. Figure 4: Training dynamics with different en- tropy regularization strategies. The complete TEPO demonstrates superior stability and performance compared to variants with maximum entropy or KL-divergence regularization. GRPO, only a small set of token actions get useful signals. Adding entropy terms spreads probability mass and weakens those scarce sig- nals. The stronger drop with KL suggests that forcing the policy to stay close to the initial model makes it hard to move toward the few actions that earn reward, so the model adapts less to the sparse feedback. Figure 5: Comparison of importance sampling strategies in sparse reward environments. Our ap- proach demonstrates more effective utilization of sparse learning signals compared to REINFORCE and prefix-based importance sampling. 4.3.2 Analysis of Sparse Reward in GRPO We further evaluated different importance sam- pling designs for sparse rewards.

Our method is best among the three. It is +1.09 points over prefix importance sam- pling (32.04% vs. 30.95%) and +0.46 points over REINFORCE-style sampling (32.04% vs. 31.58%). Relative to plain GRPO, it improves the average by 1.74 points. Prefix importance sampling shows the critic- free GRPO is a sparse rewards method. Impor- tance sampling in REINFORCE reveals bias in sentence-level rewards. Ours balances group- level credit with token-level updates via a sen- tence likelihood, which reduces variance and performs better under sparse rewards. 5 Related work 5.1 Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off in Traditional RL Balancing exploration and exploitation is a key problem in RL (Sutton and Barto, 1998). Under the maximum-entropy view, an entropy term gives a clear way to handle this trade-off (Ziebart et al., 2008; Toussaint, 2009; Chao et al., 2024). This idea shows up in common algorithms: DQN usually relies on \u03f5-greedy exploration instead of an explicit entropy term (Mnih et al., 2015), PPO often adds an entropy bonus to keep exploration active (Schulman et al., 2017), and SAC directly optimizes a maximum-entropy objective (Haarnoja et al., 2017, 2018). In RL with LLMs, the role of entropy is still unclear. RLHF training typi- cally uses a KL penalty to a reference policy (Ouyang et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2024). GRPO- style objectives and recent studies often find little or unclear benefit from standard entropy bonuses, so the effect on generation quality and training stability remains an open ques- tion (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; He et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025b; Shen, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). 5.2 RL Advancements in LLMs RL is a key part of LLM post-training (Ouyang et al., 2022; Grattafiori et al., 2024), and com- bining it with verifiable rewards further im- proves reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Recent work shows three clear trends.", "Xiao et al., 2024). 5.2 RL Advancements in LLMs RL is a key part of LLM post-training (Ouyang et al., 2022; Grattafiori et al., 2024), and com- bining it with verifiable rewards further im- proves reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Recent work shows three clear trends. First, simple policy-gradient methods still work well: GPG keeps training straightforward by using REINFORCE (Chu et al., 2025), and CISPO improves efficiency by clipping impor- tance weights and detaching them from the update; both use a standard policy-gradient loss (Chen et al., 2025). Second, GSPO shifts to sequence-level learning: it defines impor- tance ratios with whole-sequence likelihoods and applies clipping, rewards, and updates at the sequence level (Zheng et al., 2025). Third, entropy matters: (Cui et al., 2025a) find per- formance (R) fits R = \u2212a exp(H)+b, meaning lower entropy usually gives better results. This matches RLVR findings (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 2024) and aligns with LLM scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). 6 Conclusion GRPO has improved LLM mathematical rea- soning but shows fragile convergence in CoT: 8 uniform token-level entropy often triggers col- lapse or early stop. We introduce TEPO, which links group loss to sentence representations via a Markov likelihood and then to tokens through token-mean aggregation, stabilizing updates. On math benchmarks, TEPO surpasses baselines (e.g., Acc@k), sets a new state of the art, and markedly improves training stability. Limitations Although our method proposes a novel token- level framework that incorporates Markov Like- lihood to link group-level rewards with tokens via token-mean aggregation, it only connects tokens to group-level rewards. It leaves to- ken optimization to backward and fails to fur- ther distinguish how different tokens affect per- formance. Future research should focus on exploring tokens\u2019 roles in sentences and how to link with group-level reward via a general paradigm.

A Policy Optimization with KL-Divergence The objective of GRPO or RL in LLMs is to identify a new policy, \u03c0\u03b8, which is as closely aligned as possible with the ideal target dis- tribution \u03c0\u2217(Williams, 1992; Chu et al., 2025; Schulman et al., 2017, 2015; Kakade, 2001; Shao et al., 2024). This task is equivalent to minimizing the KL- divergence, expressed as: min \u03b8 KL(\u03c0\u2217(a|s)\u2225\u03c0\u03b8(a|s)) (11) Substitute Eq. 6, we get : KL(\u03c0\u03b8\u2225\u03c0\u2217) \u221dEa\u223c\u03c0\u03b8 \" (log \u03c0\u03b8(a|s) \u2212log \u03c0\u03b8old(a|s)) \u2212 \u02c6A(a, s) \u03b2 # = 1 \u03b2 Ea\u223c\u03c0\u03b8 h \u03b2KL(\u03c0\u03b8\u2225\u03c0\u03b8old) \u2212\u02c6A(a, s) i Therefore, the PPO objective is essentially solv- ing a distribution matching problem toward a target distribution shaped by the advantage function. B Policy Entropy in LLMs To extend the state-specific entropy difference to the global entropy change (i.e., entropy av- eraged over all states, which better reflects the overall exploration-exploitation balance of the policy), we first rely on a first-order Taylor expansion of entropy around the policy param- eters \u03b8k. For any state s, the entropy of the up- dated policy H(\u03b8k+1 | s) can be approximated as: H(\u03b8k | s) + D \u2207\u03b8H(\u03b8k | s), \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8kE , where \u2207\u03b8H(\u03b8k | s) is the gradient of entropy with respect to parameters \u03b8k, and \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9de- notes the", "eters \u03b8k. For any state s, the entropy of the up- dated policy H(\u03b8k+1 | s) can be approximated as: H(\u03b8k | s) + D \u2207\u03b8H(\u03b8k | s), \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8kE , where \u2207\u03b8H(\u03b8k | s) is the gradient of entropy with respect to parameters \u03b8k, and \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9de- notes the inner product. This approxima- tion holds when the parameter update step \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8k is small (a common assumption in policy optimization to ensure stability), as it ignores higher-order terms in the entropy\u2019s pa- rameter dependence. Additionally, we define d\u03c0k+1 := \u27e8\u2207\u03b8H(\u03b8k | s), \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8k\u27e9, which quan- tifies the \u201dcontribution\u201d of the entropy gradient to the state distribution update. The entropy difference relies on a critical 11 approximation: H(\u03c0k+1) \u2212H(\u03c0k) = Es\u223cd\u03c0k+1 [H(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s))] \u2212Es\u223cd\u03c0k [H(\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s))] \u2248Es\u223cd\u03c0k [H(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s))] \u2212Es\u223cd\u03c0k [H(\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s))] = Es\u223cd\u03c0k [H(\u03c0k+1(\u00b7 | s)) \u2212H(\u03c0k(\u00b7 | s))] = \u22121/\u03b7 \u00b7 Cova\u223c\u03c0k \u03b8 (\u00b7|s) \u0000log \u03c0k \u03b8 (a | s), A(s, a)\u0001 Here, d\u03c0t (for t = k, k + 1) denotes the state distribution of the actor network at iteration t\u2014specifically, the distribution of states en- countered by the policy during interaction with the environment (e.g., d\u03c0k+1 aligns with the updated policy \u03c0k+1). This approximation is justified by three key considerations: \u2022 The policy update step is small, inducing high structural similarity and distributional overlap between d\u03c0k+1 and d\u03c0k\u2014a natural consequence of the step-wise policy update process (Schulman et al., 2015). \u2022 Replacing d\u03c0k+1 with d\u03c0k (from the first to the second line) incurs negligible error un- der first-order approximation: the visitation probability difference d\u03c0k+1 \u2212d\u03c0k is a second- order term relative to the policy vector error \u03c0k+1 \u2212\u03c0k by Taylor Equation (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). \u2022 Residual bias from distribution shifts is cor- rected via importance sampling (Schulman et al., 2017), preserving the approximation\u2019s unbiasedness (i.e., the approximation error has zero expectation). C Covariance Term To refine the covariance term (for scenarios like LLM sequence generation), we substitute two key components enhancing update stability and interpretability: 1. Normalized Advantage Function Unlike immediate reward r(s, a), A(s, a) quantifies ac- tion a\u2019s \u201drelative value\u201d under s (e.g., A(s, a) = r(s, a) \u2212V (s), with V (s) as the state value function). This isolates a\u2019s incremental bene- fit over other actions, making the covariance term a better policy update guide. Normal- ized via K reward samples ( y1:K from \u03c0k) like RLOO (Kool et al., 2019) and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as: A(s, a) = r(y)\u2212mean(r(y1:K)) std(r(y1:K)) , this scales A(s, a) to zero mean/unit variance, preventing large reward magnitudes from dom- inating updates and stabilizing optimization. 2. Token-Level Log-Probability Difference For sequence-generation tasks , we define the token-level log-probability difference to ap- proximate the current policy\u2019s expected log- probability over the state distribution d\u03c0k: Es\u223cd\u03c0k h log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) i = log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) \u2212Es\u223cd\u03c0k h log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) i as the parameter update \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8k in- duces only linear changes in log-probabilities. The right-hand side matches the form of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between suc-", "distribution d\u03c0k: Es\u223cd\u03c0k h log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) i = log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) \u2212Es\u223cd\u03c0k h log \u03c0k \u03b8(a | s) i as the parameter update \u03b8k+1 \u2212\u03b8k in- duces only linear changes in log-probabilities. The right-hand side matches the form of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between suc- cessive policies. Substituting these components yields the step-wise covariance Cov: Cov(yi) = A(yi) \u22121 N N X j=1 A(yj) ! \u00b7 log \u03c0\u03b8(yi) \u22121 N N X j=1 log \u03c0\u03b8(yj) ! This links token-level preference changes and normalized relative values.

However, preva- lent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model\u2019s capacity, lead- ing to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Super- vised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condi- tion arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model\u2019s pol- icy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring ex- ploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effec- tiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. In- stead of providing direct answers, HINT sup- plies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms ex- isting methods, achieving state-of-the-art re- sults with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learn- ing and greater data efficiency. Code is avail- able on Github1. 1 Introduction RL methods, particularly GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), play a pivotal role in advancing long CoT reason- ing (Wei et al., 2022). By avoiding the instability and overhead of training a separate value model, GRPO leverages group-based reward aggregation to deliver stable and efficient learning signals. Such RL approaches (Ahmadian et al., 2024; Shao et al., * Corresponding authors 1https://github.com/ViviqwerAsd/HINT 2024; Hu, 2025; Yu et al., 2025) have become a key driver of progress in reasoning ability, en- abling models to explore solution paths on verifi- able problems. Building on these advances, recent reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), and Kimi- 1.5 (Team et al., 2025) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks like mathematical problem solving (Shao et al., 2024)and program- ming (Jiang et al., 2024). A critical challenge for GRPO, despite its strong empirical performance, is its tendency to generate sample groups consisting entirely of incorrect an- swers on tasks whose difficulty exceeds the policy model\u2019s evolving capacity (Zhao et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025). In such cases, the learning process suf- fers from reward sparsity, where the feedback be- comes uniform and uninformative (Yu et al., 2025), ultimately reducing training efficiency and wasting valuable data. Leveraging external, off-policy data is a key method for addressing this issue. This method has been implemented in prior work through two main lines of remedies. (I) Mixed-policy (Yan et al., 2025;", "feedback be- comes uniform and uninformative (Yu et al., 2025), ultimately reducing training efficiency and wasting valuable data. Leveraging external, off-policy data is a key method for addressing this issue. This method has been implemented in prior work through two main lines of remedies. (I) Mixed-policy (Yan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Fu et al., 2025b): Mixed-policy involves interleaving RL with SFT in a hybrid scheme to stabilize training by leveraging off-policy data. (II) Using hints (Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b): To miti- gate reward sparsity and ensure continuous train- ing updates, another common approach is to lever- age prompts derived from the ground truth during the rollout phase, guiding the model\u2019s exploration along correct trajectories. Despite their potential benefits, both of these ap- proaches introduce a significant drawback rooted in a substantial distributional mismatch. In mixed- policy training, this mismatch arises between the off-policy SFT data and the on-policy updates, which lead to conflicting gradients and training instability (Yan et al., 2025). Similarly, answer- 1 arXiv:2510.09388v1 [cs.LG] 10 Oct 2025 Question: Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. Hint: The first pair, 1+100, sums to 101, \u2026 ,yielding 101\u00d750=5050. Hint: Try writing the series twice, once forwards and once backwards. S = 1 + \u2026 + 100, S = 100 + \u2026 + 1. Oh, I know! 2S = 101 \u00d7 100 = 10100, S = 5050. Rollout Stage The answer is 101. Inference Stage Question: Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 1000. The answer is 1001. S = 1 + 2 + \u2026 + 1000, S = 1000 + 999 + \u2026 + 1, 2S = 1001 \u00d7 1000, S = 500500. Repeating the answer from the hint The answer is 101. Answer-level hint: Ours: The answer is 5050. Getting the answer by itself Different performance Answer-level hint: Ours: Figure 1: Comparison of Hint Mechanisms and Their Impact on Learning. The answer-level hint provides an explicit partial solution. The model can achieve a reward by simply completing this pre-defined path, which encourages learning a superficial shortcut rather than genuine reasoning. In contrast, our heuristic hint offers a high-level conceptual prompt, compelling the model to develop its own solution path independently. level hints create a severe mismatch between the distribution of the ground truth and the distribu- tion of the current policy. This results in a decep- tive learning signal that, while inflating training rewards, ultimately misguides policy updates to- ward non-generalizable or spurious solution paths (See Figure 2). Fundamentally, the aforementioned drawbacks stem from a lack of what we term training affin- ity. This core issue that arises from an over- reliance on off-policy sources, such as SFT data or answer-level hints, which inevitably creates a sig- nificant distributional mismatch with the model\u2019s current policy (Fu et al., 2025a). This mismatch, in turn, leads to excessively high variance in the importance sampling ratios, destabilizing the en- tire training process. This instability is such a core challenge that prominent algorithms like PPO in- troduce mechanisms such", "a sig- nificant distributional mismatch with the model\u2019s current policy (Fu et al., 2025a). This mismatch, in turn, leads to excessively high variance in the importance sampling ratios, destabilizing the en- tire training process. This instability is such a core challenge that prominent algorithms like PPO in- troduce mechanisms such as clipping to manage it (Schulman et al., 2017), the behavior of which itself provides a signal of training dynamics. To leverage this insight and create a quantitative diag- nostic, we define Affinity metric in terms of training stability, considering both the frequency of clipping and the variance of the importance sampling ratios. To leverage off-policy data for enhancing model capability while preserving training affinity, the guiding principle must be to help the model artic- ulate the solution on its own, rather than being directly told the answer. To this end, we pro- pose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting frame- work. As illustrated in Figure 1, HINT implements this principle by providing heuristic hints instead of partial ground-truth answers. These hints serve as high-level guidance, helping the model navigate challenging problems without disclosing solutions. This dynamic is akin to the Socratic method in teaching, where guiding a student with thoughtful prompts, rather than supplying answers, is crucial for developing robust and generalizable reasoning skills. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We introduce the first formal definition of low training affinity, a key failure mode in RL methods that incorporate off-policy data. Building on this formalization, we propose Affinity, a quantitative metric that enables the continuous monitoring of these critical training dynamics. \u2022 To effectively enhance the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities while preserving high Affinity, we pro- pose HINT, a framework that adaptively providing heuristic hints. HINT guides the model towards successful trajectories without compromising its autonomous exploration and reasoning capabilities. \u2022 Extensive experiments validate our approach. HINT consistently outperforms methods based on mixed-policy and answer-level hints, achiev- ing state-of-the-art results with models of various scales across multiple datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates robustness and superior gen- eralization. 2 methods 2.1 The Illusion of High Reward A central challenge in RL is discovering successful trajectories under a limited sampling budget. Al- though most approaches rely on the reward signal during training to evaluate learning quality, this signal is not always reliable or accurate. To de- mostrate this, we conduct a simple experiment 2 60 fewer steps 80 more steps Figure 2: A comparison of training rewards (top) and test accuracy (bottom). High rewards during training do not necessarily lead to high test accuracy, indicating that reward signals may be misleading indicators of model generalization. where we train Qwen2.5-7B (Team, 2024) on the DAPO-Math-170K (Yu et al., 2025), with periodic evaluation on MATH-500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021) test set. During the training phase, if all of its roll- outs for a problem are incorrect, we will give an answer-level hint to the model. Figure 2 shows the outcome of this experiments. Answer-level hint rapidly boosts rewards, creating the illusion of faster convergence. However, the plot on the bottom", "set. During the training phase, if all of its roll- outs for a problem are incorrect, we will give an answer-level hint to the model. Figure 2 shows the outcome of this experiments.

However, the plot on the bottom reveals a different story, as this apparent improvement does not translate into better generalization, with test accuracy stagnating at a low level. Furthermore, providing more detailed hints does not necessarily yield better outcomes, since excessive bias may cause the model\u2019s behav- ior to deviate substantially from its current policy and potentially destabilize training. The discrepancy between high training rewards and stagnant test accuracy raises a critical question: why does an apparently strong learning signal fail to produce a generalizable policy? Our anal- ysis reveals that this problem originates from the severe answer leakage caused by answer-level hints. At a mechanistic level, these hints encourage large deviations from the current policy, generating up- dates with high importance ratios. These updates are then frequently clipped, which nullifies much of the potential learning signal. While this points to the importance of clipping, we find that its fre- quency alone is an incomplete indicator of training quality. The stability and diversity of the updates that survive clipping are also crucial for effective learning. To properly diagnose these dynamics, we must quantify both how much of the learning signal survives clipping and the variability of those surviv- ing updates. This motivates our proposal of a new set of metrics to evaluate exploration efficiency and quality. 2.2 Quantifying exploration efficiency and quality The foundation for our new metrics is a direct anal- ysis of the clipping mechanism, which constrains policy updates within a trust region (Schulman et al., 2015). While clipping improves stability, it also suppresses part of the original learning signal, making it difficult to evaluate how effectively the model leverages sampled trajectories. To quantita- tively assess this, we focus on two factors that criti- cally influence training quality: (1) the frequency with which policy updates are clipped, and (2) the variability of importance ratios. The first deter- mines how much of the learning signal survives clipping, while the second reflects how stably the surviving updates are distributed. Building on these considerations, we introduce two complementary metrics: Effective Update Ratio (EUR) and Update Consistency (UC). Effective Update Ratio (EUR). EUR quantifies the proportion of policy updates that remain within the trust region, thereby preserving the original learning signal. Formally, it is defined as EUR = P i wi 1{|\u2113i| \u2264\u03b4} P i wi , (1) wi = |Ai|, (2) \u2113i = log \u03c0\u03b8(ai | si) \u03c0\u03b8old(ai | si) (3) In this definition, Ai denotes the advantage of sam- ple i, wi is the absolute advantage serving as its weight, and \u2113i is the log-importance ratio between the new policy \u03c0\u03b8 and the old policy \u03c0\u03b8old. A higher EUR indicates that most updates fall within the trust region and are therefore not suppressed, allow- ing the model to retain more informative gradients. Update Consistency (UC). While EUR mea-", "its weight, and \u2113i is the log-importance ratio between the new policy \u03c0\u03b8 and the old policy \u03c0\u03b8old. A higher EUR indicates that most updates fall within the trust region and are therefore not suppressed, allow- ing the model to retain more informative gradients. Update Consistency (UC). While EUR mea- sures the proportion of valid updates, it does not 3 capture the variability of those updates. To address this, we focus on the set of samples whose log- importance ratios remain within the trust region, i.e., I = {i : |\u2113i| \u2264\u03b4} UC is then defined as the weighted standard devia- tion of the log-importance ratios within this set: UC = sP i\u2208I wi (\u2113i \u2212\u00b5\u2113)2 P i\u2208I wi , (4) \u00b5\u2113= P i\u2208I wi\u2113i P i\u2208I wi (5) Here, \u00b5\u2113represents the weighted mean of the log- importance ratios within the trust region, and I denotes the corresponding index set. A low UC im- plies that the updates are conservative and tightly concentrated around the mean, whereas an exces- sively high UC suggests unstable updates driven by values approaching the trust region boundary. While the EUR and UC provide critical insights into training, neither metric is sufficient on its own to guarantee high-quality exploration. For instance, a high EUR, which indicates that most updates are being utilized, could be deceptive if those updates are highly inconsistent (a high UC), suggesting an unstable policy on the verge of divergence. Con- versely, perfect consistency (a low UC) is of little value if very few updates are effective to begin with (a low EUR), a scenario that would indicate stalled or overly conservative learning. An ideal training process must therefore achieve a balance: leverag- ing a high volume of effective updates that are also highly consistent. Therefore, to capture this essen- tial synergy in a single, holistic measure, we define our unified metric, Affinity, as the combination of EUR and UC: Affinity = EUR \u00b7 exp \u0010 \u2212UC \u03c4 \u0011 , \u03c4 = \u03b4/2 (6) This multiplicative formulation ensures that Affin- ity is high only when both conditions hold simul- taneously: a substantial fraction of updates remain within the trust region, and their variability is mod- erate. As such, Affinity serves as a holistic indicator of exploration efficiency and training stability un- der online RL. In Section 3.3, we report Affinity curves along- side reward learning curves and demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher Affinity compared to baseline approaches, indicating more stable and effective online policy updates. 2.3 HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness The preceding analysis, formalized by the Affin- ity metric, reveals a central dilemma in RL which strong external guidance often degrades training quality by causing frequent clipping (low EUR) or destabilizing updates (high UC). An ideal method must therefore provide guidance that is potent enough to prevent unproductive exploration but gentle enough to maintain high Affinity. To achieve this delicate balance, we introduce HINT. As illustrated in Figure 3, HINT is an adap- tive mechanism that steers the model toward pro- ductive reasoning paths. HINT achieves this by sourcing", "provide guidance that is potent enough to prevent unproductive exploration but gentle enough to maintain high Affinity. To achieve this delicate balance, we introduce HINT. As illustrated in Figure 3, HINT is an adap- tive mechanism that steers the model toward pro- ductive reasoning paths. HINT achieves this by sourcing heuristic hints from a stronger \u201cteacher\u201d model. These hints represent a higher form of guid- ance, operating on a conceptual level to spark a reasoning process. This methodology is designed not to provide answers directly, but to equip the model with the strategic insight needed to formu- late the solution autonomously, a philosophy akin to the principle of \u201cteaching one to fish\u201d. Formally, the HINT framework operates as a two-stage process. The first stage mirrors a stan- dard GRPO update cycle. On the rollout stage, for a given problem q, the model begins by sampling a set of trajectories {o1, o2, . . . , oG} using its current policy. These trajectories are then evaluated by a reward model or predefined rules to obtain a set of rewards {r1, r2, . . . , rG}. If these rewards are not sparse (i.e., at least one trajectory is correct), the process proceeds identically to the GRPO algo- rithm. The non-sparse rewards are used to compute advantages and perform a normal policy update. The second stage, the hint-augmented rollout, is activated only if the initial rewards from the first stage are sparse (i.e., all trajectories are incorrect). In this scenario, where GRPO would stall due to a lack of learning signal, HINT intervenes. A pre- defined hint h is used to construct a hint-augmented query qh. The model is then prompted to resam- ple a new set of trajectories {oh 1, oh 2, . . . , oh G}, this time conditioned on qh. These new, hinted tra- jectories are re-evaluated to produce a new set of rewards {rh 1, rh 2, . . . , rh G}. This rescue mechanism thus turns a failed rollout into a valuable learning opportunity. By providing a heuristic hint, it is intended to enable a meaningful gradient update, which enhances training efficiency. This is accom- plished while the hint itself is carefully constructed to avoid degrading training Affinity. 4 \u2026 q Question \u2026 \u2026 Question + Hint \u2026 \ud835\udc42! \ud835\udc42\" \ud835\udc42# \ud835\udc5f! \ud835\udc5f\" \ud835\udc5f# \ud835\udc42! $ \ud835\udc42\" $ \ud835\udc42# $ \ud835\udc5f! $ \ud835\udc5f\" $ \ud835\udc5f# $ \ud835\udc5e$ Sparse Rewards Non-sparse Rewards q Hint Step1 Step2 Figure 3: The HINT Framework: An Adaptive Two-Stage Rollout Process. HINT operates in two stages. (1) Standard Rollout: The model first samples trajectories from the original problem. If the rewards are non-sparse (at least one is correct), the process follows the standard GRPO update path. (2) Hint-Augmented Rollout: If, however, the rewards are sparse (all trajectories are incorrect), the hint mechanism is activated. The model then re-rolls out conditioned on a heuristic hint from a \u201cteacher model\u201d.

(8) In addition, we decouple the rollout prompt from the policy prompt. the rollout prompt may in- clude the hint-augmented problem, while the policy prompt is restricted to the original problem only. This separation ensures that hints are used solely to stabilize exploration during rollouts, without leaking into the policy optimization stage, thereby preventing the model from developing a systematic reliance on hints after training. 3 Experiments 3.1 Setup Experimental Setup. Our experiments are con- ducted using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B (Team, 2024) as backbone models. To ensure a fair and controlled comparison, we constructed a high- quality training set derived from the DAPO-Math- 170K dataset (Yu et al., 2025). This process in- volved using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024) to generate four distinct reasoning trajectories for each problem. These outputs were then validated for correctness with Math Verify2, from which we retained 30k fully correct samples to form our final training data. For baseline methods that require a ground-truth reference solution, we designated the shortest of the four correct trajectories for each problem. Benchmarks. We evaluate the generalization ability of HINT on seven datasets, covering both in- distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, with- out using any hint during evaluation. For math- ematical reasoning, we adopt AIME243, MATH- 500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), and Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), which are widely used benchmarks. Since the test sets of AIME24 are relatively small, we report avg@32, while for the other datasets we use pass@1. To assess complex reasoning and out-of-distribution generalization, we further evaluate on ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2024), and MMLU- Pro (Wang et al., 2024). To demonstrate HINT effectiveness, we conduct systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks. Baselines. We compare HINT against sev- eral existing methods designed to improve roll- out accuracy rate or rollout efficiency in GRPO. The baselines include: (1)LUFFY (Yan et al., 2025): A hybrid approach that combines on-policy and off-policy training, ensuring that each sam- 2https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/aime24 5 pled batch contains at least one correct trajectory.

(5)BREAD (Zhang et al., 2025b): A binary search\u2013based method that identifies a hint length such that the model\u2019s rollouts are neither all correct nor all incorrect, and uses this balanced point as the hint for training. A comprehensive overview of our experimen- tal configuration, including detailed prompts, hy- perparameters, and implementation settings for all methods, can be found in the Appendix A for full reproducibility. 3.2 Main results We benchmarked our proposed method against sev- eral mainstream approaches, including both mixed- policy strategies and other hint-based methods. These experiments were conducted on two scales of backbone models: Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5- 3B. We report our results in Table 1. Our analysis reveals the following key findings: HINT enhances In-Distribution reasoning and teaches problem-solving skills. HINT signifi- cantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of mod- els, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mul- tiple in-distribution benchmarks. Models trained with HINT demonstrate substantial gains, with Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B showing average improvements of 9.0% and 6.8%, respectively, un- derscoring the effectiveness of our approach. We also observed an interesting emergent behavior dur- ing training: when a model encountered two sim- ilar, challenging problems, it would often rely on a hint for the first but then solve the second inde- pendently by applying the same reasoning pattern. This observation provides strong evidence that our heuristic and minimal hints teach the model how to reason about a class of problems, rather than simply encouraging it to memorize a solution path for a single instance. HINT generalizes to Out-of-Distribution problems by optimizing reasoning paths. HINT also demonstrates strong generalization, enhanc- ing the model\u2019s ability to tackle novel problems. Even on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets, mod- els trained with HINT showed marked improve- ments. On the OOD test sets, models trained with HINT demonstrated strong generalization, with Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B achieving average performance gains of 7.4% and 1.6%, respectively, highlighting the method\u2019s robust ability to gener- alize. This strong OOD performance is explained by a deeper phenomenon observed in our case stud- ies. We found that the model successfully reap- plies high-level reasoning methods from our hints, such as Proof by Contradiction to solve new OOD problems. This demonstrates that our method op- erates on a conceptual level, effectively teaching the model transferable problem-solving paradigms rather than just answers. It is this acquisition of new, abstract reasoning skills that drives the model\u2019s robust generalization. The effectiveness of HINT scales with model size. Our results show that the benefits of HINT are more pronounced in larger models, with the performance gains for Qwen2.5-7B consistently outpacing those for Qwen2.5-3B across all evalu- ations. To understand the mechanism behind this trend, we analyzed the training rollouts and found a clear difference in how effectively each model leveraged the provided hints.", "benefits of HINT are more pronounced in larger models, with the performance gains for Qwen2.5-7B consistently outpacing those for Qwen2.5-3B across all evalu- ations. To understand the mechanism behind this trend, we analyzed the training rollouts and found a clear difference in how effectively each model leveraged the provided hints. A quantitative anal- ysis confirmed that out of 100 randomly sampled rollouts where hints were provided to each model, Qwen2.5-7B produced a successful trajectory fol- lowing the hint 34.0% more often than Qwen2.5- 3B did. This superior efficacy in converting hints into successful outcomes directly explains the more pronounced performance gains, indicating that the greater capacity of larger models allows them to better capitalize on the abstract guidance offered by HINT. 3.3 Training Dynamics To investigate the impact of various off-policy strategies, we tracked the EUR, UC, and Affinity metrics for our method alongside several key base- lines which detailed in Section 3.1, with the full training dynamics plotted in Figure 4. This analysis led to the following key observations. In the early stages of training, the model shows strong resistance to off-policy data. As illustrated in the left plot of Figure 4, all three off-policy methods exhibit a sharp drop in EUR, indicating that clipping occurs very frequently at this stage. We call this initial period the \"EUR Col- 6 Table 1: Main Performance Comparison of HINT against Baselines. HINT demonstrates significant performance gains on in-distribution datasets, improving the Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B models by 13.5% and 6.8%, respectively. The method also shows strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data.

Notably, compared to GHPO and LUFFY, HINT achieves a higher steady-state EUR, demonstrating its su- perior ability to help the model accommodate and leverage off-policy data. Over-reliance on off-policy data often pre- vents the model from converging. As shown in the middle plot of Figure 4, both GHPO and LUFFY quickly reach high UC values at the be- ginning of training and remain at that level. This indicates persistently large variance in importance sampling, which results in unstable model updates and hampers convergence. In contrast, the UC of HINT does not spike early on but instead indicates that our heuristic hints avoid casing large distribu- tional shifts, allowing the policy updates to remain centered around a stable learning direction. HINT enables the model to genuinely absorb the knowledge provided by hints. As presented in the right plot of Figure 4, the Affinity of HINT gradually approaches that of GRPO as training pro- gresses. This implies that the model becomes in- creasingly capable of identifying which hints are truly useful. In other words, HINT enhances train- ing efficiency and sample utilization in the early stages, while maintaining convergence trends con- sistent with GRPO in the later stages, thereby bal- ancing early gains with eventual stability. 3.4 In-depth Analysis Does hinting truly enhance training effective- ness? We measured the number of valid samples (i.e., rollouts that are not entirely incorrect) gener- ated by GRPO and HINT under an equal computa- tional budget (8 hours of training). As shown in the top of Figure 5, although HINT produced slightly fewer total samples than GRPO, it yielded a greater number of valid samples. This indicates that HINT achieves higher training efficiency under the same time constraints, suggesting that hints guide the model toward more productive exploration trajec- tories rather than wasting updates on implausible rollouts. From a broader perspective of the entire training process, the proportion of valid samples with HINT is higher than that of GRPO by 18.9%, further con- firming that hinting improves the signal-to-noise ratio of training data. In other words, the gradient 7 Figure 4: We record the EUR, UC, and Affinity metrics across different training processes to investigate the impact of various off-policy strategies on training. Left: EUR during training; Middle: UC during training; Right: Affinity during training. Overall, HINT most effectively alleviates the EUR collapse, avoids persistently high UC, and achieves higher Affinity, thereby enabling more stable and efficient training.

The dominance of valid rollouts under HINT suggests that hints not only improve rollout qual- ity but also reshape the global optimization land- scape by steering policy learning toward regions where correct reasoning is more likely to occur. This mechanism explains why HINT can achieve sustained improvements even without relying on answer leakage, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable training outcomes. Does hinting affect the diversity of model\u2019s outputs? Entropy serves as a key metric for mea- suring generation diversity (Cheng et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). Building on the training pro- cesses for HINT and the GHPO baseline detailed in Section 3.1, we further compared their dynamics by analyzing the average entropy of reasoning tra- jectories throughout the training period. For each method, we separately computed the mean entropy on samples with and without hints. GRPO HINT Figure 5: Sampling Efficiency of HINT and GRPO at Different Training Stages. Under an equal budget, HINT yields 1,485 more valid samples (top) and achieves a 18.9% higher final proportion of valid samples (bottom). As illustrated in Table 2, on the subset requir- ing hints, the entropy of HINT is notably higher than GHPO, which is answer-level hints. This is because answer-level hints often provide a \u201chalf- completed\u201d reasoning trajectory, forcing the model to follow a predetermined path with limited explo- ration. In contrast, ours do not disclose specific solution steps, leaving the reasoning process en- tirely up to the model and thereby encouraging broader exploration across different trajectories. Even more surprisingly, we find that on sam- 8 ples where no hints are needed, GHPO still yield the lowest entropy compared to both GRPO and HINT. This suggests that long-term exposure to answer-level hints suppresses diversity at a deeper level: even when no hints are provided, the model\u2019s ability to generate diverse reasoning paths is dimin- ished. 4 Related Work Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Reasoning. Recent advances in RL ap- proaches have significantly enhanced the reason- ing capabilities of LLMs. Large reasoning Mod- els (LRMs) such as OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), and Kimi- 1.5 (Team et al., 2025) achieve state-of-the-art per- formance on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., mathe- matics, coding, scientific problem solving) by lever- aging Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Re- wards (RLVR) (Liu et al., 2025a; Hu et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025), where automatically checkable rules provide supervision signals. Compared to earlier methods like SFT or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), RLVR has shown superior generalization and robustness (Chu et al., 2025; Snell et al., 2025). Building on this paradigm, subsequent studies have proposed improved opti- mization strategies and structured prompting tech- niques that further strengthen reasoning capabil- ities (Schulman et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Despite this progress, a critical failure mode for ex- isting RL methods is reward sparsity, which occurs when all rollouts in a sample fail. Overcoming this challenge", "improved opti- mization strategies and structured prompting tech- niques that further strengthen reasoning capabil- ities (Schulman et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Despite this progress, a critical failure mode for ex- isting RL methods is reward sparsity, which occurs when all rollouts in a sample fail. Overcoming this challenge is essential for enhancing the stability and sample efficiency of training large reasoning models. Improving Rollout Efficiency in RL for LLMs. A well-known challenge in methods such as GRPO is the vanishing gradient issue. This problem oc- curs when all trajectories in a sample group are incorrect, as the group advantage collapses to zero, yielding no gradient for policy updates (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). To mitigate this, some works have focused on injecting external, off-policy data to improve training efficiency and stability. This has been explored through two main strate- gies. Some methods use mixed-policy, replacing a portion of on-policy rollouts with complete, high- quality trajectories from off-policy datasets (Yan et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). Others employ partial supervision, providing segments of a ground truth to rescue failed rollouts (Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b). While these approaches effec- tively improve rollout efficiency, their over-reliance on off-policy data can misguide policy updates, steering the model toward non-generalizable or spu- rious solution paths. 5 Conclusion In this work, we identify the problem of low train- ing affinity caused by an over-reliance on off-policy data and propose HINT, an adaptive framework to resolve this trade-off. HINT significantly outper- forms strong baselines on competitive math bench- marks and demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization. Our work showcases a scalable and principled path toward more capable, self- improving reasoning models, with future work pointing towards extending HINT to new domains and modalities.

First return, entropy-eliciting explore. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.07017. 11 Appendix A Experimental Details A.1 Detailed Setup Platform. All of our experiments are conducted on workstations equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80GB memory. Training Data. The training was performed us- ing a carefully selected subset of the DAPO-Math- 170K dataset (Yu et al., 2025). As the original dataset lacks ground-truth solutions, we curated our own by first using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate four reasoning trajectories for each prob- lem. After validating the final answers with Math- verify, we compiled a high-quality training set of 30k problems for which all four generated trajecto- ries were correct. For baselines requiring a ground truth, the most token-efficient of these four correct trajectories was designated as the ground truth. For our methods, we pre-generated the required heuris- tic hints for the entire 30k-sample training set using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The prompts used in the above process will be detailed in Section B.5. Important Parameters of HINT. HINT is im- plemented based on the open-source Rl framework lsrl4. The RL algorithm employs the GRPO ad- vantage estimator with no KL penalty (kl_coef is set to 0.0). The clipping parameter \u03f5 is set to 0.2. For each group, 8 answers are generated, and the training batch size is set to 2. Distributed training utilizes the DeepSpeed library with the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 1e-6. The train batch size is set to 8, gen batch size is set to 32, accum steps is set to 64, gen update steps is set to 128, temperature is set to 0.9, max response is set to 4096. Mixed-precision training with BF16 is enabled. Memory optimization employs ZeRO Stage 2, with optimizer state offloading to CPU. Important Parameters of Other Baselines. For baselines with publicly available code repositories, we utilized their official implementations and the parameters specified in their respective publica- tions. For methods without public code, such as BREAD(Zhang et al., 2025b) and QuestA(Li et al., 2025), we reproduced their results using the lsrl framework, strictly adhering to the experimental parameters detailed in their papers. Reward Setup. For our experiments, we employ a sparse, binary reward function. The reward is determined exclusively by the correctness of the 4https://github.com/lsdefine/lsrl Figure 6: HINT Prevents Entropy Collapse and En- courages Sustained Exploration.

We use the Math-Verify tool for automatic verification, assigning a reward of +1 for a correct final answer and 0 for an incorrect one. B Further Analysis B.1 Details of HINT\u2019s Entropy HINT Encourages Sustained Exploration. The entropy of the generation distribution serves as a key indicator of exploration diversity. As illustrated in Figure 6, HINT avoids the rapid entropy collapse observed in GRPO during the early stages of train- ing. Instead, HINT maintains a consistently high level of entropy, indicating that the model actively explores when first introduced to the hints. This pe- riod of high exploration corresponds directly to the \u201cEUR collapse\u201d phase (discussed in Section 3.3), explaining that while the model initially resists the off-policy guidance, it is nevertheless engaged in a productive and diverse search of the solution space. During the middle stages of training, HINT\u2019s en- tropy does not decrease monotonically. It exhibits periodic increases. We attribute this to the model encountering novel types of hints and adapting its exploratory behavior to learn how to utilize them. Crucially, even after the policy stabilizes in the later stages, HINT maintains a significantly higher entropy level than GRPO. This provides strong evi- dence that HINT\u2019s heuristic guidance successfully fosters more continuous and diverse exploration, preventing the policy from prematurely converging to a deterministic state. 12 Figure 7: Accuracy of Different Methods. HINT Achieves Higher Final Accuracy Despite Slower Ini- tial Convergence. B.2 Details of HINT\u2019s Accuracy Our results reveal an interesting trade-off: while the off-policy guidance from HINT may initially slow the rate of convergence, it ultimately enables the model to achieve a higher performance ceiling. As shown in Figure 7, HINT initially exhibits a slower rate of accuracy improvement compared to GRPO. This initial lag is consistent with the early training stages where the model shows resistance to the heuristic hints and has not yet learned to leverage them effectively. However, as training progresses, the model begins to adapt and utilize the guidance. This leads to an accelerated learning rate after approximately 100 steps, with HINT\u2019s ac- curacy eventually surpassing GRPO\u2019s and reaching a higher final value. This dynamic suggests that the model requires an adaptation period to master the use of heuristic hints, but once learned, this skill allows it to develop stronger and more robust capabilities.

Question: [Question] User: 15", "Identifying & Interactively Refining Ambiguous User Goals for Data Visualization Code Generation Mert \u02d9Inan1, Anthony Sicilia1*, Alex Xie2, Saujas Vaduguru2, Daniel Fried2, Malihe Alikhani1 1 Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA 2 Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA {inan.m, alikhani.m}@northeastern.edu Abstract Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, am- biguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker\u2019s intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambigui- ties in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g. the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxon- omy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics bet- ter correlate with human annotations than un- certainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, and therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three prag- matic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representa- tion Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation. 1 Introduction In human-human interactions, ambiguity resolution has been explored through various well-established frameworks in linguistic pragmatics, such as Ra- tional Speech Act (RSA)(Frank and Goodman, 2012), Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Lascarides and Asher, 2007; Kamp et al., 2010), and Questions Under Discussion (QUD) (Roberts, 2012). Further, as Clark (1996) argues, success- ful interactions depend on establishing common * This author is currently at West Virginia University, but completed this work at Northeastern University. Figure 1: This figure summarizes the contributions of this paper. We formalize and identify ambiguity in data visualization code, then use pragmatics-inspired dialogue strategies to interactively resolve ambiguities in user intents. To this end, we present a multimodal taxonomy of ambiguity categories, and new metrics informed by this taxonomy. ground by iterative alignment of assumptions and resolving ambiguities on the way to common ground. On the other hand, human-AI collabo- ration still often fails to provide a human-like pair- programming experience (Williams, 2001; Sarkar et al., 2022), and we claim that a key challenge here is ambiguity resolution\u2014as users\u2019 natural lan- guage descriptions of intent often map to multi- ple valid code implementations, requiring iterative clarifications. In this paper, we propose identify- ing (\u00a73) and then resolving ambiguities (\u00a74) in a arXiv:2510.09390v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 dyadic setting of human-LLM interactions using pragmatics-inspired, persona-based prompting. To achieve this goal, we frame the natural lan- guage to code problem as a two-player cooperative dialogue. A director (typically the user) specifies their intent in natural language and a coder (typi- cally an automated coding assistant) generates code with the functionality the director had in mind. A goal for this pair-programming setting is to have a coder agent that", "code problem as a two-player cooperative dialogue. A director (typically the user) specifies their intent in natural language and a coder (typi- cally an automated coding assistant) generates code with the functionality the director had in mind. A goal for this pair-programming setting is to have a coder agent that can interact with the director agent to resolve ambiguity and generate code. While, in principle, the coder\u2019s uncertainty in this task can come from many sources, focus is typically placed on the inherent model limitations of the coder agent caused by insufficient knowledge or training. In contrast, this work focuses on the uncertainty of the coder about the user\u2019s goals\u2014i.e., the ambiguity of director\u2019s requests. We focus on how the di- rector can resolve the coder\u2019s uncertainty through clear communication about intended goals, and how coders can clarify goals through conversation. Based on our definition of ambiguity, we hy- pothesize that ambiguity reduction should lead to improved code accuracy. To study this, we propose a taxonomy that more precisely codifies what is meant by ambiguity. Our taxonomy includes cate- gories of ambiguity, and examples specific to the plotting domain \u2014 where the presence of multi- modal contexts allows us to explore more diverse sources of natural language ambiguity (e.g.. We propose a number of metrics based on our taxon- omy that allow us to dynamically (and automati- cally) quantify natural language ambiguity in text- to-code problems. We use our definition of am- biguity to study how multi-step communication with the director can serve to reduce ambiguity. Guided by theories of pragmatics we simulate di- alogue between two machine agents. This shows how (pragmatic) dialogues can help coders resolve ambiguity, and ultimately, improve task success. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We propose a taxonomy to codify ambiguity in multimodal text-to-code problems; 2. We propose a number of potential metrics to measure these defined notions of ambiguity, and empirically test which best represents dif- ferent aspects of ambiguity; 3. We propose strategies, inspired by theories of discourse, for incorporating dialogue in a coding agent to reduce ambiguity and increase task success. From our analyses, we find that our metrics can predict ambiguity categories, and pragmatic dia- logue increases task success (measured by correct- ness of the generated code) while targeting the identified ambiguities. We make our code, and annotations publicly available for the camera-ready version of this paper. 2 Related Work Code Generation Large language models of code have shown strong performance on natural lan- guage to code generation (Narechania et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2024; Lozhkov et al., 2024, inter alia). However, work investigat- ing how users interact with code generation models has found that impressive benchmark performance does not always translate to improved task out- comes for users (Sarkar et al., 2022; Vaithilingam et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Mozannar et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024). Some of this gap can be attributed to the ambiguity inherent to human in- teractions with code models: Sarkar et al. (2022) observe that user", "task out- comes for users (Sarkar et al., 2022; Vaithilingam et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Mozannar et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024). Some of this gap can be attributed to the ambiguity inherent to human in- teractions with code models: Sarkar et al. (2022) observe that user utterances are often underspec- ified and ambiguous, forcing users to repeatedly refine their prompts and adapt their thought pro- cesses to match the LLM. Likewise, Mozannar et al. (2024) observe that users often provide fuzzy in- structions, motivating a clarification feature. Under- specified instructions are also present in real-world software engineering benchmarks such as SWE- bench (Jimenez et al., 2024), as found during the construction of SWE-bench Verified. Recent work has studied ambiguity resolution for code LLMs via clarification questions. Mu et al. (2024) introduce ClarifyGPT, a pipeline for code generation with selective clarification. Li et al. (2023) studies clarification for open-domain code generation in a scaffolded setting, and Zhou et al. (2025) studies the effects of multi-turn dialogue on programming problems. In addition to Yang et al. (2024), studying the performance of chat agents on data visualization code. Also, uncer- tainty estimation and explainability literature have been instrumental for quantifying ambiguity in the works by Liu et al. (2024) and Lin et al. (2024). Further, explorations of ambiguity in SQL genera- tion (Bhaskar et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) and the role of ambiguity in requirements engineering (Kamsties, 2005; Bano, 2015) have been recently studied. https://openai.com/index/ introducing-swe-bench-verified/ Ambiguity in NLP Tasks Ambiguity has been studied across a wide array of NLP tasks, including coreference resolution (Poesio and Artstein, 2005), (visual) question answering (Min et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2023; Papakostas and Papadopoulou, 2023; Park et al., 2024) and machine translation (Iyer et al., 2023; Schouten et al., 2023; Niwa and Iso, 2024; Madureira et al., 2024). Current language models generally struggle when applied directly to tasks with ambiguity (Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Wildenburg et al., 2024); by default, they do not recognize ambiguity in instructions, nor do they seek clarification or engage in proactive dialogue to resolve ambiguity (Deng et al., 2023). However, re- cent sampling-based methods have shown promise in detecting ambiguity (Kadavath et al., 2022; Kuhn et al., 2023b; Cole et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), while prompting and self-improvement methods have proven effective for clarifying ambiguity with LLMs (Krasheninnikov et al., 2022; Kuhn et al., 2023a; Andukuri et al., 2024). Pragmatics One approach to resolving ambigu- ity is to assume the speaker is a rational agent play- ing a cooperative game (Grice, 1975) where they are choosing an utterance that gives the code gen- eration model the best chance of recovering the program they have in mind. This form of inference has been formalized in the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework (Frank and Goodman, 2012). RSA has been productively applied to program- ming tasks where a user specifies their intent using examples (Pu et al., 2020, 2023; Vaduguru et al., 2024). Similar approaches to disambiguation also been applied to code generation", "has been formalized in the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework (Frank and Goodman, 2012). RSA has been productively applied to program- ming tasks where a user specifies their intent using examples (Pu et al., 2020, 2023; Vaduguru et al., 2024). Similar approaches to disambiguation also been applied to code generation from natural lan- guage using large language models (Zhang et al., 2023). Other pragmatic theories of discourse work include RSA for referential communication in a game of color (Monroe et al., 2017; McMahan and Stone, 2020), question under discussion (Ko et al., 2023), and discourse theories as applied to dialogue settings (Asher et al., 2016; Chi and Rudnicky, 2022; Atwell et al., 2021, 2024, 2022). The frame- works we use to implement our dialogue agents are inspired by these in this work. 3 Defining and Identifying Ambiguity We define ambiguity to arrive at a taxonomy that helps us identify it automatically. Director-Coder Setting Initially, we formalize the setting described in \u00a7 1. The director has a target intent I \u2013 a random variable representing the goal image (or corresponding code) \u2013 which the director communicates through a natural language utterance U(I). The utterance U is also a random variable. The coder interprets this utterance to directly generate code (and corresponding image) \u02c6I \u223cC(U), where C(U) is a code distribution con- ditional to the utterance U. We assume there is some evaluation method that produces a random er- ror E(I, C(U)) to quantify goal fulfillment in this context. For example, in later experiments, we use k repeated samples \u02c6I \u223cC(U) and check the accu- racy of the code by counting how many pass unit tests (pass@k). In this definition, we will assume that the minimization of the error, E, is preferable. 3.1 Ambiguity in Plotting Code Definition We define ambiguity from the perspec- tive of the coder. Intuitively, we frame ambiguity as any portion of uncertainty held by the coder that could be reduced by changing the natural language utterance U. More specifically, interpreting E as a form of error, we define ambiguity as the quantity: E(I, C(U)) \u2212E(I, C(U\u2217)) where U\u2217= arg minU\u2032\u2208\u03a5 E(I, C(U\u2032)), (1) and \u03a5 is a constraining set to ensure director ut- terances are \u201creasonable.\u201d For instance, \u03a5 could be the set of all finite, grammatically correct utter- ances in the English language. Interpretation In a typical machine learning problem, a model h is picked from some constrain- ing set model class H, selecting this model to re- duce error as much as possible. For instance, we can select a linear model h from the set H of all linear models parameterized by elements of Rd. Meanwhile, there is also a best model h\u2217that min- imizes the error for our problem. This minimum error (or uncertainty) is simply irreducible without changing the problem definition. Here, we adapt this to define ambiguity. The term E(I, C(U\u2217)) represents the minimum uncertainty, treating the utterance itself U as the model h we wish to pick, within the aforementioned problem. In turn, am- biguity is formally defined as the excess error (or", "irreducible without changing the problem definition. Here, we adapt this to define ambiguity. The term E(I, C(U\u2217)) represents the minimum uncertainty, treating the utterance itself U as the model h we wish to pick, within the aforementioned problem. In turn, am- biguity is formally defined as the excess error (or uncertainty) of the coder that could have been re- We do not differentiate between these, since each code corresponds to an image. The best model h\u2217is called the Bayes optimal model and the error of this model is the Bayes error or the aleatoric uncertainty (H\u00fcllermeier and Waegeman, 2021). Figure 2: This figure depicts the causal graph of a multi- modal coding task. I: Image, C: ground truth code used to generate I, T: unit tests, P: director\u2019s prompt, and A: coder\u2019s answer. When ambiguity is prevalent, then the edges of this graph are cut, and the coder\u2019s answer relies on a non-descriptive prompt. duced through improved communication by the di- rector. This quantity formalizes the process of disambiguation \u2013 studied throughout this paper \u2013 and what it means to disambiguate for a coder with fixed knowledge. Taxonomy Next, we use this definition to arrive at a taxonomy of ambiguities in the plotting domain. We observe that different input modalities to LLMs inherently convey different types of ambiguity (see Figure 2), as these modalities serve different user intents. For instance, an image in the \u201cmind\u2019s eye\u201d of the director corresponds to an ideal end product, but the director may not know how this translates to precise code or the best ways to communicate their ideal. This type of cross-modality dependency has been studied by the discourse coherence literature (Alikhani et al., 2020; Inan and Alikhani, 2024). In order to represent these cross-modal dependen- cies, we need a taxonomy that captures the different types and sources of ambiguity, which we present next. These categories draw inspiration from cog- nitive science, linguistics, and discourse literatures, as well as our definition. \u2022 Semantic ambiguity: Certain words and their meanings can have multiple interpretations. Thus, misinterpretation of U by the coder may lead to errors that would be prevented with a better choice of words (i.e., the optimal utter- ance U\u2217), implying higher ambiguity (Eq. 1). This category is based on semantic ambiguity in cognitive science literature as explored by Zempleni et al. (2007); Degani and Tokowicz (2010). e.g. \u201cregular matplotlib style plot\u201d, \u201cgrouped histogram\u201d, \u201ccolor plot\u201d \u2022 Presupposition: Instructions may presuppose default parameter values without explicitly mentioning their use, and disagreement in coder and director presuppositions can also be a source of error caused by the coder\u2019s inter- pretation of U, leading to increased ambiguity. This category is based on the presuppositional ambiguity as explored by Zuber (1973); Atlas (1977); Kempson (1979); Jaszczolt (2002). e.g. knowing the default parameters of the scatter() function, or original instructions ask to \u201ckeep the distribution plot in blue\u201d, but no explicit parameter for \u201cblue\u201d is made because the default is known to be blue. \u2022 Underspecification: Some non-default pa- rameter values or functions are either not men- tioned at", "knowing the default parameters of the scatter() function, or original instructions ask to \u201ckeep the distribution plot in blue\u201d, but no explicit parameter for \u201cblue\u201d is made because the default is known to be blue. \u2022 Underspecification: Some non-default pa- rameter values or functions are either not men- tioned at all, or partially described in the in- structions. By leaving out these details, a coder\u2019s own interpretation of U can be counter to the director\u2019s goals, once again increasing the error compared to U\u2217and the ambiguity as defined previously. This category is based on the relationship between underspecification and ambiguity as explored by van Deemter and Peters (1996). Some context-specific sub- categories for scientific plotting can include, \u2013 Color parameter, e.g. \u201csolid red\u201d, alpha value is set but not mentioned \u2013 Distance parameter, e.g. \u201cenough\u201d space be- tween axes \u2013 Shape parameter, e.g. marker shape is set even though not mentioned \u2013 Size parameter, e.g. marker size is set even though not mentioned \u2013 Location parameter, e.g. legend location is set even though not mentioned \u2013 Label parameter, e.g. title is set to be \u201cxxx\u201d even though not mentioned \u2013 Line parameter, e.g. \u201cfull line\u201d, \u201cdashed line\u201d \u2013 Function, e.g. to plot a heatmap, using either imshow() or pcolor(). Annotating for Ambiguity We carry out an an- notation and do a preliminary analysis of the dis- tribution of these categories of ambiguity in the DS1000 dataset (Lai et al., 2022), specifically with questions from plotting libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) (Hunter, 2007). This dataset, featuring natural language prompts from StackOverflow with human-written tests and plots, inherently contains potential human-introduced ambiguities. We, the authors, who have prior experience with ambigu- ity in dialogue, annotated 155 coding instructions from the DS1000 dataset. Despite the DS1000 dataset\u2019s claim that the problems are written to be unambiguous, we still find that 57% of the plotting questions fall under one or more of the categories we have defined above. Interannotator agreement on 25 sampled questions, measured by Cohen\u2019s Kappa (\u03ba = 0.587), indicates moderate to substan- tial agreement, as anticipated for this subjective Figure 3: This figure shows the dialogue flow for a pragmatic coder, where the initial intent of the dialogue is given on the left, and the different responses generated using separate personas are given in the middle. meta-labeling task (Fleiss and Cohen, 1973; Baner- jee et al., 1999; Viera et al., 2005). Table 1 shows the distribution of different categories. Ambiguity Category Distribution semantic ambiguity 23.8% presupposition 11.9% underspecification 73.8% Table 1: This table shows the ambiguity category distri- bution within the ambiguous prompts (57%) of the 155 plotting questions in the DS1000 dataset based on our annotations. 3.2 Automatic Metrics for Ambiguity In addition to the human annotations, we propose automatic ways of measuring ambiguity based on our formalizations and taxonomy (\u00a73.1), and com- pare them to traditionally employed uncertainty- based metrics. Sampling Diversity (SD) A common approach (Cole et al., 2023) to measuring uncertainty about a given utterance U is to count the number of distinct programs that satisfy the constraints specified in", "ambiguity based on our formalizations and taxonomy (\u00a73.1), and com- pare them to traditionally employed uncertainty- based metrics. Sampling Diversity (SD) A common approach (Cole et al., 2023) to measuring uncertainty about a given utterance U is to count the number of distinct programs that satisfy the constraints specified in the prompt. If the coder\u2019s solution distribution C(U) assigns non-zero probability to many codes (i.e., it generates many different codes upon sampling), then these codes all differ in apsects unconstrained by the prompt U from the coder\u2019s perspective. This indicates the coder is uncertain about the intent of U. The more distinct programs there are for a given sample size, the higher the coder\u2019s uncer- tainty about the utterance is. This method serves as a baseline for ambiguity measurement; while it does capture uncertainty about the utterance U, it does not capture information about the optimal prompt U\u2217in any way. This is an important dis- tinction between typical notions of uncertainty and our proposed definition of ambiguity. We give the implementation details in Appendix \u00a7D, where we compare Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) of both pro- grams using edit distance. Repeated Parameter Counting (RPC) Another way to quantify ambiguity in an utterance U is to focus on identifying function calls/parameters that appear across the set of proposed programs. This is conceptually similar to sampling diversity, which compares distinct solutions directly. We hy- pothesize function calls and parameters may better capture presuppositional ambiguity within our tax- onomy since this ambiguity is directly related to the default parameter settings within a code library. More specifically, our proposed RPC metric mea- sures ambiguity by counting which function calls and parameters remain constant across the code so- lutions. The fewer elements that must remain fixed, the higher the ambiguity. Similar to sample diver- sity, this metric does not explicitly consider the optimal prompt U\u2217. We expect it to perform well for presupposition, because it focuses on aspects of code that are often presupposed. Optimal Result Gap (ORG) Building on our definition in Eq. 1, we propose a subfamily of met- rics that attempt to directly compute this mathemat- ical notion of ambiguity. While the coder\u2019s realized uncertainty E(I, C(U)) is easy to compute by us- ing Pass@k scores for a given utterance U, the min- imum uncertainty E(I, C(U\u2217)) is more difficult because we cannot be sure of the optimal utterance U\u2217. We propose to approximate U\u2217by using one of three oracle information sources: ground-truth code for the plot, ground-truth image for the plot, and unit tests for the \u201cPass\u201d determination. We pro- vide these oracle sources to a large language model and ask it to provide a prompt that enable itself to generate the code, create the image with code, or generate code that would pass the tests. While this approach provides an estimate, we acknowledge its limitations: the model-generated re-prompt may not fully capture an ideal, ambiguity-free prompt, making it an imperfect but practical approximation of the optimal formulation. At the same time, we expect it to improve over the previous two metrics because it", "the tests. While this approach provides an estimate, we acknowledge its limitations: the model-generated re-prompt may not fully capture an ideal, ambiguity-free prompt, making it an imperfect but practical approximation of the optimal formulation. At the same time, we expect it to improve over the previous two metrics because it does consider the optimal prompt U\u2217. Self Verification This is a traditional method of uncertainty estimation where a model is asked to return its uncertainty about a solution when pro- vided a problem statement. This baseline uncer- tainty methodology, like sampling diversity and RPC, does not explicitly consider the optimal ut- terance U\u2217, which is an important aspect of our definition. We use a prompt similar to the ones used by Cole et al. (2023) and Sicilia et al. (2024). LLM-Based Ambiguity Rating (LAR) On the other hand, we can extend self-verification to bet- ter consider our definitions of ambiguity. Instead of querying the model for its uncertainty, we can prompt it to rate the ambiguity of U on a scale of 1 to 10, providing the model with our ambiguity taxonomy as a resource in the prompt. This en- courages the rating aligning with our pre-defined ambiguity categories, rather than being an arbitrary self-assessment. Since these categories are also based on our initial mathematical definition of am- biguity, it also serves as heuristic approximation of Eq. 1. Different from baseline methods focused on uncertainty, it implicitly considers the optimal prompt U\u2217through the characterizations of opti- mality encoded in our taxonomy. 4 Disambiguation with Coding Dialogues After formalizing ways of identifying ambiguity, we now propose that ambiguity can be resolved using dialogues, and we formalize a dialogue setup with persona-based generation components. 4.1 Basic Dialogue Setup We propose resolving ambiguity in natural lan- guage specifications of intent with multi-turn di- alogue. Each coding task is defined by the natu- ral language intent I (see Figure 3) and the initial request U1, as before. Meanwhile, our proposal extends the previous setting to allow for dialogue: 1. Director presents instruction U1(I). 2. Coder responds with an utterance U2(U1). 3. Director continues Ui(U:i\u22121, I), using access to target image and utterance history. 4. Coder continues Ui+1(U:i\u22121), using access to utterance history only. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 based on the number of turns controlled as a hyperparameter. 6. Session always terminates with coder provid- ing their final code \u02c6I(U:). In this setting, coder utterances can include di- alogue acts like clarification questions, e.g., \u201cC: what location should I put the legend,\u201d which evokes a specific response, \u201cD: The top left cor- ner\u201d or can be more general declarations that start a sub-topic of conversation \u201cC: I\u2019ll plan for the de- fault legend arguments. D: Hmm. Keep it on the top left. What else can you change?\u201d 4.2 A Pragmatic Dialogue Setup We hypothesize ambiguity reduction in our pro- posed dialogue setting can be improved by encour- aging LLM-based coders to consider pragmatics in their dialogue strategy. We operationalize this by using persona prompting and in-context learn- ing as described in Wang et al. (2024);", "you change?\u201d 4.2 A Pragmatic Dialogue Setup We hypothesize ambiguity reduction in our pro- posed dialogue setting can be improved by encour- aging LLM-based coders to consider pragmatics in their dialogue strategy. We operationalize this by using persona prompting and in-context learn- ing as described in Wang et al. (2024); Schulhoff et al. (2024), and Zheng et al. (2024). Next, we describe the personas we use to generate responses. These are based on three theories of discourse: co- operative, discoursive, and inquisitive. For the im- plementation details of this setup, please refer to Appendix A. 4.2.1 Dialogue Strategies Cooperative The first framework we use is based on Grice\u2019s maxims of cooperative dialogue part- ners (Grice, 1975; Horn, 1984; Levinson, 2000; McMahan and Stone, 2020). Here, the coder is a pragmatic agent that recursively engages in inter- action and models the director\u2019s state of mind to respond to an utterance. We use the Gricean co- operativity principle to design the prompt for this dialogue strategy, given in Appendix B. Discoursive The second pragmatics framework is based on Discourse theories. Here, the coder is not necessarily responding strategically. Still, it\u2019s utterance is always related to the history of the con- versation and the coding context through a set of coherence relations. Hence, when a coder produces an utterance, it relates to the set of solutions it has sampled as well as what the director has said in the previous turn. This definition of discourse is mostly similar to SDRT-like dialogue-based rela- tion categories (Ko et al., 2023; Asher et al., 2016; Fu, 2022; Atwell et al., 2024; Alikhani et al., 2023). We provide the persona prompt in Appendix B. Inquisitive The third pragmatics framework is related to discourse theories, but focuses more on question-type relations. In this case, the coders utterance explicitly answers an implicit question posed by the director. This discourse framing is de- scribed by Clifton and Frazier (2012) under the um- brella term of Questions Under Discussion (QUD). When a director gives a coding instruction, the prag- matic coder with QUD understanding first detects an implied question indirectly posed by the director and the coder answers that question. The persona prompt is given in Appendix B. 5 Experiments & Findings In this section, we provide details of our experi- ments of disambiguation, and user simulation and show the utility of our ambiguity taxonomy and metrics. We answer multiple research questions and report our findings in combination with our experiments. We first describe the experiments for our taxonomy and automatic metrics as described in Section \u00a73.1, and then follow up with experimen- tation based on the dialogue approach to coding we described in Section \u00a74. We experiment mainly with GPT-4o in our experiments, but provide ad- ditional results for LLaMA-3.2, StarCoder, and CodeLLaMA in Appendix \u00a7C.

Having a dialogue with pragmatics-inspired personas improves task success drastically, yet there is still ambiguity be- tween the ceiling performance. truth human-produced ambiguity labels for each instance of the 155 plotting questions. We observe that ORG, which contains the oracle solutions to approximate ambiguity, predicts the semantic ambi- guity category, but less so the other categories. This may be due to the class imbalance in the dataset, and also the suboptimal nature of reprompts used in the ORG metrics. The most predictive of any ambiguity category is the LART metric, where a model is asked to rate the ambiguity using our tax- onomy. This shows the validity and applicability of this metric to unsupervised contexts. The lowest prediction power comes from the traditional uncer- tainty measurement technique of self-verification (SV), as it does not necessarily correlate with the ambiguity of the user\u2019s intent, but the uncertainty of the model providing an answer to the prompt.

The examples are picked to show when most models have low scores, or to show the performance according to different categories of ambiguity. Pragmatic Dialogue Increases Task Success To test the hypothesis of whether the pragmatic dia- logue setup that we proposed in \u00a74 disambiguates and improves task success (as measured by the pass@k correctness score), we carry out a com- parative experiment with results shown in Table 3. Here, we test two scenarios, one in which the di- rector is given the reference code and one where the reference image is used. This comparison alle- viates the concern about whether there is ground truth code leakage from the director to the coder. It can be observed that the best-performing dia- logue strategy is pragmatic cooperative reasoning in both categories, likely benefiting from the theory- of-mind reasoning and chain-of-thought training in modern LLMs. The inquisitive strategy is the least-performing model, even worse than the baseline, which may mean that always looking for questions under the discussion can hinder disambiguation. Despite improvements, a gap remains between the best- performing strategy and the ceiling performance, indicating unresolved ambiguity. Since user intent is fixed in this static task, full resolution is unlikely, and even the ceiling performance is imperfect, as the re-prompt itself may still contain ambiguity. Pragmatic Dialogue Targets Ambiguities To evaluate whether dialogue strategies improve code accuracy by directly addressing the ambiguities identified in our taxonomy, we measure the change in mean pass@1 scores between ambiguous and non-ambiguous cases (Figure 4). The results clearly show that dialogue-driven improvements are consistently greater for ambiguous cases than for non-ambiguous ones. This confirms that di- alogue effectively disambiguates prompts across all three pragmatic personas. However, when the We focus specifically on task success rather than user sat- isfaction due to the subjectivity and costs of user experiments, while already showing that ambiguity is addressed. Figure 4: This figure shows a breakdown of the change in the mean pass@1 scores (\u2206= post-dialogue \u2212origi- nal) across ambiguous and non-ambiguous instances of the DS1000 dataset. Dialogue shows better performance in ambiguous instances instead of non-ambiguous ones. reference image is provided instead of the code, the Discoursive Persona performs similarly in both cases, suggesting that dialogue alone may not fully resolve ambiguities. Additionally, in line with Ta- ble 3, \u2206pass@1 for the Inquisitive Persona is neg- ative in non-ambiguous instances, yet it still suc- ceeds in clarifying ambiguous prompts. 5.1 Error Analysis Table 4 presents a detailed performance breakdown of different dialogue strategies.

Notably, certain questions remain challenging even after dialogue, yet specific ambiguity categories align with the most effective pragmatic strategy. For instance, nearly all personas failed to resolve the first un- derspecification question (mean pass@1: 0.000), with only the cooperative persona achieving oc- casional success (mean pass@1: 0.267). Interest- ingly, in some cases, additional dialogue negatively impacted performance across all personas. The inquisitive persona performed best for vagueness- related ambiguities, while the discoursive and coop- erative personas excelled in addressing parameter underspecification. 6 Conclusion Pragmatic theories of language emphasize that meaning is never fully encoded in words alone but emerges through the interactional work of ne- gotiating intent. Drawing on this perspective, our study shows how ambiguity in natural language code specifications, whether through underspec- ification, presupposition, or semantic vagueness, can be systematically identified and quantified. By translating concepts from discourse and linguistic theory into a taxonomy and set of operational met- rics, we move beyond ad hoc uncertainty measures toward a principled account of when and why user intent becomes opaque. This reframing positions ambiguity not as incidental error but as an analyz- able property of communication between humans and coding agents. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that dialogue offers a practical path for resolving these ambiguities. We characterized various pragmatics frameworks in relation to pair-programming-like dialogues that happen between a director and a coder. We then analyzed the effects of having di- alogues with different reasoning strategies on the executability and disambiguation of the final gen- erated code. As having a dialogue based on code is becoming the norm with LLMs, focusing on the pragmatics of dialogue opens up new venues for de- veloping dialogue systems, datasets, and evaluation mechanisms for code generation. With this, future coding assistants can transform ambiguity into a space for alignment, producing collaborations that are both more accurate and more human-like. Limitations We proposed using pragmatic dialogue for code generation, but the major limitation is from the side of human data collection and evaluation. We resorted to automatic metrics already being used or developed for this study to evaluate our setup with- out relying on human annotators. However, this entails that the evaluations may not be human-like and may not show the most accurate representa- tions even though they show improvements in gen- erally accepted code executability standards. Fur- ther, we did not deploy a dialogue system to study our approach. Instead, we resorted to simulations using LLMs, which may or may not accurately rep- resent how a human interlocutor would act in a real-world setting. We wanted to minimize this by using large parameter models for dialogue gener- ation and StackOverflow-based code instructions from the DS1000 dataset.

Since a natu- ral language instruction accompanies the DS-1000 problem instances, we seed the interaction using that interaction as the first director turn (uD 1 ). We prompt the model to use different strategies to gen- erate responses. Pragmatic Coder We first extract the code con- text and the coding instructions from the DS1000 dataset and then convert it into a dialogue format as described in section \u00a74.2. Then, using GPT-4o, we generate codes that respond to the original instruc- tion (sampled k times). To the pragmatic coder, we present a set of possible unique answers it can choose from the generated codes and the dialogue history that is happening and ask for a follow-up utterance for the coder to converge to the solution that the director is describing, i.e. gC(uD 1 ). We then instruct it to give three solutions based on the reasoning types. For the regular director, we pro- vide the reference code (or the reference plot in the case of a multimodal model) and the dialogue history and ask to generate a follow-up utterance to converge to a solution without giving away the answer. All the details of the prompts are given in Appendix B. Dialogue Policy We employ a rule-based dia- logue policy to choose one of the three utterances we generated for each strategy in the simulation. For the first turn of the dialogue, we do not use any LLM generations but directly use the coding instruction from the DS1000 dataset. For the fol- lowing turns, we generate three different utterances, one for each of the pragmatic director\u2019s reasoning ways, and then generate a single utterance without any pragmatic reasoning prompting for the coder for each of the three responses of the director. We use the number of turns as a hyperparameter to generate the dialogue and perform ablation experi- ments on it. We do not mix reasoning styles across the dialogue\u2019s turns, but we choose a single reason- ing style for the overall dialogue. We also exper- iment with providing the reference image or the reference code to the director to see how clarity of instructions affects execution. B Prompting Details B.1 Pragmatic Coder B.1.1 System Prompts: Director: You are a coding director. There is an- other coding agent you are going to have a dialogue with. You have a final product in mind. This is go- ing to be named the REF CODE. You want a coder to write the codes for this final product. For the first turn of the dialogue, you give a", "other coding agent you are going to have a dialogue with. You have a final product in mind. This is go- ing to be named the REF CODE. You want a coder to write the codes for this final product. For the first turn of the dialogue, you give a specific instruction or a question about the final product. Then, the coder will give you some answers, and then you will have another turn to refine the codes. Coder: You are a coding agent. There is another director agent you are going to have a dialogue with. The things you say depend on your persona. You have the following different personas (reasoning styles): - Cooperative Persona (Pragmatic): You want to converge on the solution as quickly as possible and follow Grice\u2019s Maxims when choosing your words. You anticipate the director\u2019s cooperative reasoning. You possess theory-of-mind capabilities and common sense. Figure 5: This figure shows the change in unique responses of code completions depending on the temperature of the model. From the left, the plots are showing histograms for 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0 temperatures. The horizontal axis is the question number from the DS1000 matplotlib dataset. It is observable that the uniqueness is high for higher temperatures, expectedly. However, very high temperatures may have minor differences that increase the overall uniqueness. Hence, a moderate temperature like 0.7 gives more reliable results for further experimentation. - Discourse Reasoning Persona: Everything you say is connected to the previous turn with a rela- tion. The possible discourse relations are Comment, Clarification Question, Elaboration, Acknowledg- ment, Continuation, Explanation, Conditional, Al- ternation, Result, Background, Narration, Correc- tion, Parallel, Contrast. You try to identify the relation between the utterance of the director in the previous with your utterance. Then you reply with an utterance that has the appropriate relation. - Questioning Persona: Everything you say has an implicit question underneath it. You should tell what the director is actually asking for (the question under their instruction), and give your answer to that implicit question. The director has a final product in mind. You, as the coder, write the codes for this final product or have a dialogue about the instruction. For the first turn of the dialogue, the director gives a specific instruction or a question about the final product. Then, you will give some answers, and then the director will have another turn to refine the codes. user prompts: Director: REF CODE: \u201c\u2018+ ref-code \u201c\u2018 + DIA- LOGUE HISTORY:\" + dialogue-history + What can you say on the follow-up turn for the coder to converge to the reference code?

D Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Functional Uniqueness Algorithm In this section, we detail the AST-based function uniqueness comparison algorithm between two sep- arate generated functions. The code for the algo- rithm is given in Listing 1. We find this form of comparison to be appropriate for plotting tasks as the lines of code of interest are generally the calls to library functions, particularly those provided by the matplotlib API. E Temperature Adjustments We present our experimentation results for the tem- perature tuning in Figure 5. F Example Dialogues We present the reference-image-based coder- director dialogues for the final example from Table 4. def compare_parse_trees(response1 , response2): \"\"\"Compare the parse trees of two responses.\"\"\" unique_function_calls = [] unique_params = {} unique_keywords = {} try: tree1 = ast.parse(response1) functions1 = get_params(tree1) tree2 = ast.parse(response2) functions2 = get_params(tree2) for function in functions1.keys(): if function not in functions2.keys(): unique_function_calls.append(function) else: for i, arg in enumerate(functions1[function ]): if arg not in functions2[function ]: if function not in unique_params.keys(): unique_params[function] = [] unique_params[function ]. append(arg) if isinstance(arg , dict): for key in arg.keys(): for j in range(len(functions2[function ])): if isinstance(functions2[function ][j], dict): if key not in functions2[function ][j].keys(): if function not in unique_keywords.keys(): unique_keywords[function] = [] unique_keywords[function ]. append(key) else: if arg[key] != functions2[function ][j][key]: if function not in unique_keywords.keys: unique_keywords[function] = [] unique_keywords[function ]. append(key) except SyntaxError: print(\"Syntax Error\") return unique_function_calls , unique_params , unique_keywords Listing 1: This code snippet shows how the functions of two separate generated codes are compared using their ASTs.

Coding Question: highlight in red the x range 2 to 4 (0.667 Initial Pass@1) Cooperative Dialogue (0.967 Final Pass@1) Director: highlight in red the x range 2 to 4 Coder: Both solutions will highlight the x range from 2 to 4 in red, but they differ in transparency. Solution 1 uses an \u2018alpha\u2018 of 0.3, which means it\u2019s more transparent than Solution 2 with an \u2018alpha\u2018 of 0.5. If you want a less noticeable highlight, go with Solution 1; for more prominence, choose Solution 2. Director: Increase the opacity of the highlighted area so that it\u2019s fully opaque instead of transparent. Make sure the highlight is prominently visible. Coder: To make the highlight fully opaque, you\u2019ll need to set the \u2018alpha\u2018 parameter to 1. You can modify either of the existing solutions by changing \u2018alpha=0.3\u2018 or \u2018alpha=0.5\u2018 to \u2018alpha=1\u2018. This will eliminate transparency entirely and ensure that the red highlight is prominently visible. Director: Make sure the highlight completely covers the x range from 2 to 4 with no gaps or transparency. The highlighted area should be clearly distinguished and fully filled in red. Discoursive Dialogue (1.0 Final Pass@1) Director: highlight in red the x range 2 to 4 Coder: Clarification Question \u2013 The provided solutions differ in their transparency settings through the \u2018alpha\u2018 values. Could you specify your preference regarding how prominent or subtle you\u2019d like this red highlighting effect to be? Director: Please ensure that the red highlight is fully opaque, with no transparency effect. Coder: Correction \u2013 To make sure we match your requirement of having no transparency, you\u2019ll need to modify the \u2018alpha\u2018 value in either solution from its current setting to \u20191\u2019, achieving a fully opaque appearance. Director: Please ensure the x range highlighted in red is fully opaque with no transparency. We need it to stand out distinctly against the rest of the plot. Inquisitive Dialogue (0.167 Final Pass@1) Director: highlight in red the x range 2 to 4 Coder: What you seem to want is ensuring that the area between x=2 and x=4 is clearly visible on your plot highlighted in red. Do you want it to be very noticeable or somewhat subtle? The difference here is that one solution is more transparent than the other; which visibility level do you prefer? Director: Please make the highlighted area more noticeable by removing any transparency so it\u2019s fully opaque. Coder: The implicit question here is about achieving complete opacity for the highlighted area between x=2 and x=4 on a plot. If neither existing solution (\u2018Solution 1\u2018 or \u2018Solution 2\u2018) meets your requirements\u2014since they include some degree of transparency\u2014you\u2019ll need an alternative with no alpha setting or perhaps adjusting \u2019alpha\u2019 to \u20181\u2018.

Current mainstream graph prompt- tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural in- formation in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt se- mantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi- scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specif- ically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking hu- man cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outper- forms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance. \u2217Corresponding Author Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In recent years, the scarcity of labels in practical settings has spurred ex- tensive research on the \u201cpre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm for GNNs [15, 31, 33, 37]. This paradigm utilizes self-supervised learning to derive generic, task-agnostic representations from un- labeled graphs, followed by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks using task-specific labels. However, these ap- proaches suffer from an inherent limitation: the discrepancy be- tween pre-training objectives and downstream tasks, which leads to suboptimal performance [26]. To address this issue, recent work introduces prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is initially proposed in NLP and achieving remarkable success [13], and can effectively bridge the gap between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks by incorporating lightweight learnable prompt parameters to modify inputs or outputs, without updating the parameters of the pre-trained model. Inspired by this, pre-training and prompt tuning arXiv:2510.09394v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Ziyu Zheng, et al. have been extended to the graph domain [4, 24, 25]. Compared to fine-tuning, graph prompt exhibits lower computational overhead and better generalization. Existing graph prompt learning methods can be categorized into two categories based on dependency on pre-training strategies. Pre- training-dependent methods [2, 14, 25] design unified templates for pre-training objectives and downstream tasks to reduce their discrepancy. Pre-training-agnostic methods [4, 6, 12, 35] enhance generality by inserting learnable feature prompt vectors into inputs or outputs, requiring no specific pre-training strategy. Further, we classify pre-training-agnostic methods by their prompting mecha- nisms: (1) Single-step prompt tuning [4, 6, 12, 34] employ a direct generation approach where the complete prompt for downstream tasks is produced in a single forward pass. (2) Multi-step prompt tuning [35] progressively derives final prompts through iterative inference, mimicking the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [29] rationale to achieve stronger expressiveness. However, these feature-based prompt tuning methods focus ex- clusively on single granularity (node-level, edge-level, or subgraph- level) during prompt generation, overlooking the intrinsically coex- isting multi-scale information from nodes to hierarchical subgraphs in real-world graphs. As illustrated in Figure 1, prior works synthe- size node/subgraph-specific prompt features using learnable basis vectors or a condition network. GCOT is the current state-of-the-art method designed with text-free multi-step refinement prompts for graph chain of thought architectures, but it still remains confined to node-level granularity at each step. This means that only a single perspective is considered in the prompt generation, fundamentally limiting prompt diversity. To overcome the singularity of prompt granularity in existing methods, in this work, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain- of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompt tuning framework. Achieving this design requires solving two core challenges. First, how to construct multi-granularity information for prompt generation? In hierarchical graph representation learning [7], the original graph is progressively partitioned into smaller subgraphs [9, 32] by merging nodes or edges to extract multi-scale features.

In hierarchical graph representation learning [7], the original graph is progressively partitioned into smaller subgraphs [9, 32] by merging nodes or edges to extract multi-scale features. How- ever, these methods are typically designed under supervised set- tings and ultimately aim to learn a graph representation for solving graph-level tasks. In graph prompt learning, our objective is to obtain a general multi-scale representation that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. Therefore, instead of directly apply- ing the multi-scale representation to downstream tasks, we treat them as an intermediate basis vector pool to enrich node-level prompts with multi-scale features. Specifically, we design a light- weight coarsening network with a low-rank matrix architecture to learn hierarchical coarsened representations. These representations serve as a multi-scale basis vector pool for generating node feature prompts infused with diverse structural granularities. Second, how to integrate multi-scale information into multi-step reasoning? While the multi-scale basis vector pool provides rich hierarchical features, direct aggregation of all granularities in a single step could cause feature interference and suboptimal prompt generation. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches [5, 29], we find that multi-step progressive prompt optimization is a supe- rior solution. In the NLP domain, CoT requires manually designed textual templates to guide the model\u2019s reasoning. For non-textual graph data, we innovatively treat hierarchical coarsened repre- sentations as structured thought\u2014from global topology to local details. These multi-granularity representations serve as progres- sively detailed \u201ctextual examples\" in CoT, thereby replacing the guiding role of text. We further propose a backtracking-based pro- gressive prompt optimization strategy: at each reasoning step, the pre-trained embedding is iteratively refined by integrating features of specific granularities, achieving a coarse-to-fine reasoning chain. This process mirrors human cognitive refinement, similar to NLP\u2019s iterative text refinement for enhanced answer accuracy. The final generated prompts not only retain the structural outline of coarse granularity but also incorporate discriminative features from fine granularity, enabling more precise capture of hierarchical semantics compared to traditional single-granularity methods. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose the first graph chain of thought framework that integrates multi-granularity information, overcoming the single- granularity limitation of existing methods. \u2022 We simulate human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity by designing a low-rank coarsening network for multi-scale feature extraction and a backtracking prompt mechanism for progressive prompt generation. \u2022 Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets for node and graph classification demonstrate that our multi-step, multi- granularity prompting framework outperforms state-of-the-art single-granularity methods. 2 Related Work 2.1 Graph Pre-training In recent years, graph pre-training techniques have attracted ex- tensive research due to their ability to operate without labeled data [15, 36]. These methods are primarily categorized into con- trastive learning [28, 33] and generative learning [8, 37]. Contrastive learning methods construct multiple views by sampling positive and negative samples, then maximizing the consistency between positive samples.

Contrastive learning methods construct multiple views by sampling positive and negative samples, then maximizing the consistency between positive samples. Generative learning methods pre-train encoders by reconstructing node features or graph structures. These ap- proaches employ different pre-training objectives to transfer pre- trained knowledge to various downstream tasks. However, due to the significant gap between downstream tasks and pre-training objectives [25, 26], the performance on downstream tasks may be compromised. 2.2 Graph Prompt-Tuning Recent advances in graph prompt learning have sought to bridge the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks by introducing task-specific prompts. Early works, such as GPPT [24] and Graph- Prompt [14], reformulate downstream tasks as link prediction or subgraph similarity tasks. All-in-One [25] unified various down- stream tasks as graph-level tasks. Feature-based prompt method GPF+ [4] and SUPT [12] introduced feature-space prompting and subgraph prompt, where learnable vectors modify input. Edge- Prompt [6] inserts edge-level prompts in the aggregation at each level from an edge perspective. ProNOG [34] and DAGPrompT [2] accounted for node heterophily in the prompt by preserving neigh- bourhood similarity.

GCOT [35] introduces the chain of thought to generate multi-step prompts. However, these methods only focus on single-granularity information during prompt generation, ignoring the rich multi-granularity features that co- exist in real-world graphs. 2.3 Graph Coarsening Graph coarsening generates simplified graphs by merging nodes or edges. Hierarchical graph coarsening techniques sample a hi- erarchical learning structure to obtain multiple subgraphs at dif- ferent scales. Traditional methods compress the graph through spectral clustering [19], non-negative matrix factorisation [30]. In recent years, learnable graph coarsening techniques [7, 32] progres- sively aggregate the nodes into coarser graphs through learnable assignment matrices, while preserving important structures, and ultimately generating compact graph-level representations. Graph coarsening naturally provides a hierarchical abstraction mechanism for us to capture multi-scale information in graph prompt learning and learn multi-scale prompts. 3 Preliminaries Notions. We denote a graph as\ud835\udc3a= (V, E), where V = {\ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b} represents the set of the nodes and E \u2286V \u00d7 V represents the edge set. Let \ud835\udc41represent the total number of nodes. Node features are usually represented by the matrix X \u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc39, where each row x\ud835\udc56corresponds to the node \ud835\udc56\u2019s \ud835\udc39-dimensional feature vector.

Its element \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57= 1 if there exists an edge between node \ud835\udc56and \ud835\udc57, and otherwise, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57= 0. Graph Neural Networks.

Most Graph Neural Networks operate under a message-passing paradigm [10]. Within this scheme, the representation h\ud835\udc56of each node \ud835\udc56is updated iteratively in each layer. This update involves collecting messages from the node\u2019s neigh- borhood, denoted N (\ud835\udc56). Specifically, the representation h\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc56at layer \ud835\udc59is computed by first applying an aggregation function AGGR(\u00b7) to the representations from layer (\ud835\udc59\u22121) within N (\ud835\udc56), followed by an UPDATE(\u00b7) function: \u02dch\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc56= AGGR(\ud835\udc59) ({h\ud835\udc59\u22121 \ud835\udc57 : \ud835\udc57\u2208N (\ud835\udc56)}), (1) h\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc56= UPDATE(\ud835\udc59) ( \u02dch\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc56, h\ud835\udc59\u22121 \ud835\udc56 ).

Specifically, in each reasoning step, the graph coarsening network constructs multi-scale coarsened representations that encompass both coarse-grained and fine-grained information. These coarsened representations as thoughts form a hierarchical basis vector pool for prompt generation. Subsequently, a backtracking-based prompt mechanism is employed to incrementally integrate prompts from coarse to fine granularity, generating hierarchical prompts. Finally, the refined representation is optimized via downstream task loss. 4.2 Multi-scale Prompt Node Level Prompt. During the prompt-tuning phase, the pa- rameters of the pre-trained model remain frozen. Using the frozen embeddings directly as input to the coarsening network would limit the model\u2019s ability to adapt to downstream tasks. To ensure that the input can be adjusted during training while preserving hierarchical information when extracting multi-scale features, we first generate node-specific prompts for each node. Similar to GCOT [35], we employ a conditional network along with the initial pre-trained embeddings to produce node-level prompt vectors \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc65, which serve as task-specific multi-scale features.

The prompted embedding serves a dual role: as an augmented input to the coarsening network and as the initial state of the inference chain. Multi-scale Thought Construction. To inject multiple levels of information into the prompting process, rather than relying only on node iteration updates. We are incrementally updating prompts by constructing multi-scale thoughts so that the prompts contain infor- mation at multiple granularities. In traditional CoT [29], thought is defined as the instruction under each reasoning step. Here, we use coarsened representations at different scales to analogise thought under different stages. For thought construction, we need to generate a node assignment matrix for each scale. Regarding the implementation of the assign- ment matrix, there are parametric and non-parametric approaches in earlier work [9, 32]. In this work, we design a lightweight coars- ening network to implement a soft coarsening strategy to generate the assignment matrix S\ud835\udc59: S\ud835\udc59= Softmax(\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5bT\ud835\udc59\u22121))), T0 = \u02c6H, (6) where the coarsened network consists of a \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\u2208R\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc5fand \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc5f\u00d7\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59(\ud835\udc5f\u226a\ud835\udc51). \ud835\udf0eis the ELU activation function. Here we implement it using the idea of low-rank decomposition [11]. The number of parameters of the improved coarsening network is much smaller than using an MLP directly. It\u2019s consistent with the low resource requirement in prompt learning. After obtaining the assignment matrix, we compute the node representations under coarser granularity: T\ud835\udc59= S\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc47T\ud835\udc59\u22121, (7) where T\ud835\udc59\u2208R\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59\u00d7\ud835\udc51denotes the coarsened node representation. Re- peating the above operation several times, we obtain a hierarchical thought pool with different levels. These representations serve as base vectors representing different granularities to guide the gener- ation of multi-scale prompts. Instead of using randomly initialised basis vectors directly in earlier methods [4, 6, 12], here we construct basis vectors incorporating specific scale information. T = [T\ud835\udc59, T\ud835\udc59\u22121, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T1], (8) The hierarchical thought pool contains diverse levels and granular- ities of information, and pre-learned multi-scale thoughts can be used as additional instructions for each reasoning step to generate prompts related to different granularities of information. Coarse to Fine-grained Backtracking Prompts. COT breaks down a complex problem into multiple steps and obtains a more accurate answer by progressively refining the manually designed text. Although GCOT also adopts multi-step prompt generation, the generation of prompts at each step relies on the optimization of the node\u2019s features, which is limited to a single granularity. This resembles repeatedly adjusting the same feature dimensions with- out introducing new perspectives, ultimately constraining prompt semantic diversity. To overcome this, we propose a granularity- aware backtracking mechanism that generates prompts step by step from coarse-grained to fine-grained using multi-granularity basis vectors. This simulates the progressive refinement of textual inputs in large-language-model Q&A. For each step, the prompts are generated as follows: p\ud835\udc59+1 \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc59+1 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57t\ud835\udc59", "this, we propose a granularity- aware backtracking mechanism that generates prompts step by step from coarse-grained to fine-grained using multi-granularity basis vectors.

Next, we inject the prompts with multi-scale information to update the node representation: \u02c6h\ud835\udc59+1 \ud835\udc56 = \u02c6h\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc56+ p\ud835\udc59+1 \ud835\udc56 , (10) Based on the constructed multi-layer thought pool, we can use its multi-granularity information to update the representation in- crementally. However, the addition of multi-level coarse-grained information may cause the node\u2019s unique information to be lost; therefore, we introduce an external cosine reconstruction loss [8] to constrain the consistency of the node representations with the pre-trained embeddings after prompting. L\ud835\udc5f= 1 \ud835\udc41(1 \u2212 \u02c6h\ud835\udc56\u00b7 h\ud835\udc56 || \u02c6h\ud835\udc56|| \u00b7 ||h\ud835\udc56|| )\ud835\udefe,\ud835\udefe\u22651, (11) where\ud835\udefedenotes the scaling factor employed to adjust feature recon- struction weights, with parameter settings adhering to prior work. This loss constrains node representations, preventing node-level information loss arising from the introduction of coarse-grained prompts following multi-level prompting. 4.3 Prompt Tuning In the prompt tuning phase, we follow the formulation of [14], which defines the task within a subgraph similarity framework. Accordingly, our loss function remains consistent with this design and is specified as follows: L\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60= \u2212 \ud835\udc3f \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc59=0 \u2211\ufe01 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u2208Dtrain ln exp(sim(\u02c6h\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \u02c6h\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)/\ud835\udf0f) \u00cd \ud835\udc50\u2208Y exp(sim(\u02c6h\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \u02c6h\ud835\udc50)/\ud835\udf0f) , (12) where \ud835\udf0fdenotes the temperature constant and sim(\u00b7) denotes the cosine similarity. \u02c6h\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56denotes the final node embedding or graph embedding, and \u02c6h\ud835\udc50the prototype embedding for class \ud835\udc50, obtained from the class mean of the labelled nodes or graphs of that class. Thus, the final loss is: L\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59= L\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60+ \ud835\udefcL\ud835\udc5f, (13) where \ud835\udefcdenotes the weight of the reconstruction loss. For the node classification task, it is important to maintain the original node-level information while injecting multi-granularity information, while for graph classification, the focus is more on coarse-grained graph- level information. During prompt tuning, only the weights of the lightweight coarsened network and the weights of the node-level conditional network are updated. 4.4 Complexity Analysis The computational complexity of MSGCOT primarily stems from two key components: multi-scale information extraction and a chain of graph prompt generation. Let \ud835\udc41denote the total number of nodes, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59represent the coarsened nodes at layer \ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc3fbe the num- ber of coarsening layers, \ud835\udc51be the hidden dimension, and \ud835\udc5fbe the low-rank dimension.

When \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc41\u226a\ud835\udc41, the overall complexity becomes nearly linear, ensuring computational feasibil- ity and efficiency. Please see the Sections 5.7 for more details about time-efficiency and parametric experiments. 5 Experiments 5.1 Experinmental Setting Datasets. We evaluate the performance of MSGCOT using sev- eral datasets from different domains, including citation networks, e-commerce, protein structures, and molecular graphs. For the node classification task, we used three citation network datasets, Cora [17], Citeseer, Pubmed [21], and the e-commerce co-purchase network Photo [22]. For graph classification, we used a protein structure dataset PROTEINS [1], a molecular graph dataset MU- TAG, BZR, and COX2 [20], which represent, respectively, nitro- aromatic compounds, ligands related to benzodiazepine receptors, and molecular structures related to cyclo-oxidase-2 inhibitors. Baselines. We compare MSGCOT with current state-of-the-art methods. These baselines fall into three categories:(1) Supervised learning. We use a supervised approach on GCN [10], GAT [27] to train on downstream labels. (2) Pre-training + fine-tuning. LP [36], GraphCL [33], and DGI/InfoGraph [23, 28] employ a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, where the model is pre-trained on un- labeled data and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. (3) Pre- training + Prompt: We uniformly use the link prediction task to pre- train the GNNs, and use graph prompt methods for prompting, in- cluding single-step prompt methods All-in-One [25], GPF, GPF+ [4], SUPT [12], GraphPrompt [14], EdgePrompt, EdgePrompt+ [6], DAG- PrompT [2], and multi-step prompt method GCOT [35]. Implementation details. We evaluate our approach on few-shot node classification and graph classification tasks. For each class, we randomly select \ud835\udc58nodes or graphs as the training set. For node classification, following the setup of GCOT, we randomly sample 1,000 nodes from the remaining nodes as the test set. For graph classification, we use the remaining samples as the test set. We report the accuracy of the models. To ensure a fair comparison, all prompt-based models adopt link prediction as the pre-training strategy, and GCN is used as the backbone with a hidden layer size of 256. The number of coarsening layers is set to 2, and the coarsening ratio is selected from {0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}. For the hidden dimension of the low-rank decomposition matrix, we set it to 8. For the prompt constraint weight \ud835\udefc, we set it to 1 in the node classifi- cation and 0 in the graph classification. We conduct 100 random sampling trials, generating 1 k-shot", "from {0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}. For the hidden dimension of the low-rank decomposition matrix, we set it to 8.

For code implementation, consult the supplementary materials. 5.2 Performance on One-Shot Classification We present the results of node classification and graph classifi- cation in Table 1, revealing the following findings: (1) MSGCOT consistently outperforms all baseline methods across all settings. On the Cora dataset, MSGCOT achieves a 3.68% improvement over the second-best method GPF, and demonstrates significant gains compared to the multi-step prompting approach GCOT, highlight- ing the importance of hierarchical prompts for node classification tasks. (2) For graph classification, MSGCOT achieves substantial improvements of 5-20% over the strongest baselines. Notably, on the COX2 dataset, it surpasses the second-best method DAGPrompt by 18.62%, as the multi-scale prompts effectively capture latent substructures. Unlike GCOT, which only incorporates node-level information in multi-step prompts, MSGCOT dynamically adjusts prompt granularity to preserve local structures while enhancing global representations, demonstrating superior performance. 5.3 Performance on Few-Shot Classification To explore the impact of the amount of labelled data on the model performance, we adjust the number of shots. As shown in Figure 3, we find that MSGCOT exhibits significant advantages in the few- shot scenario. In the node classification, MSGCOT outperforms the baseline methods by an average of 5-8% in the 1-3 shot setting, and as the sample size increases to 5-10 shots, the performance of all", "shots. As shown in Figure 3, we find that MSGCOT exhibits significant advantages in the few- shot scenario. In the node classification, MSGCOT outperforms the baseline methods by an average of 5-8% in the 1-3 shot setting, and as the sample size increases to 5-10 shots, the performance of all methods improves, but MSGCOT remains competitive. In the graph classification, MSGCOT demonstrates significant advantages at different shots on MUTAG, confirming the robustness of the method to data scarcity. When the sample size is increased, the performance remains superior compared to the multi-step single-granularity prompt method GCOT. These results validate the effectiveness of the multi-scale prompt in few-shot learning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Shot 60 65 70 75 80 Accuracy(%) MSGCOT GraphPrompt GCOT (a) Cora 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Shot 60 65 70 75 Accuracy(%) MSGCOT GraphPrompt GCOT (b) MUTAG Figure 3: Impact of shots number analysis. Beyond Single-Granularity Prompts: A Multi-Scale Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graph Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY 5.4 Ablation study To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-scale prompt mechanism in the MSGCOT framework, we conducted sys- tematic ablation studies by comparing MSGCOT with four variants: (1) w/o multi-scale prompt(MSP): removing multi-scale prompts and using only node-level prompts; (2) w/o reconstruction loss(RE): eliminating the reconstruction constraint on multi-level node prompts; (3) w/o trackback (TB): employing a unidirectional process (fine-to- coarse) for prompt addition; and (4) w/o incremental update (IU): retaining only the final prompt. As shown in the Table 2, (1) Multi-scale prompts are crucial for performance improvement. After removing it, the accuracy of node classification tasks decreased by an average of 5.52%. In con- trast, graph classification tasks experienced a more pronounced performance drop, averaging 17.7%, validating the critical role of hierarchical prompts in capturing multi-scale structural features. (2) The reconstruction loss significantly impacts node classification tasks, while graph classification focuses more on global information. (3) The backtracking mechanism is particularly critical for graph classification, with performance dropping sharply by 12-15% when using unidirectional prompts, confirming the importance of dynam- ically adjusting prompt granularity; (4) Progressive prompt updates yield a performance gain of 2-5%, indicating that intermediate-layer prompts carry complementary hierarchical information. These find- ings demonstrate that MSGCOT can coordinate features at different granularities, verifying the effectiveness of a multi-level, multi-scale prompt.

We employ the coarsening rate to control the number of coarsened nodes, where a smaller coarsening rate in- dicates fewer coarsened nodes and places greater emphasis on coarse-grained information. We validate the impact of different coarsening rates in Figure 4. Our findings reveal that the two tasks exhibit significantly distinct patterns: (1) For node-level tasks, the best performance occurs at moderate coarsening rates (0.1-0.3). When the coarsening rate is too small, critical node information is lost, leading to performance degradation. (2) For graph-level tasks, graph classification maintains stable high performance across a wider range of coarsening rates (0.05-0.3), demonstrating stronger robustness to coarsening. 1 2 3 4 5 Coarsen Layer 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 Accuracy(%) Cora Pubmed (a) Node classification 1 2 3 4 5 Coarsen Layer 54 56 58 60 62 64 Accuracy(%) MUTAG PROTEINS (b) Graph classification Figure 5: The sensitivity of the coarsening layer number. Coarsening layer. The number of coarsening layers represents both the count of multi-scale prompt layers and the steps prompt. At each prompting step, hierarchical prompts with different granu- larities are injected. We validate the impact of varying layer num- bers on multi-scale prompting. As shown in Figure 5, we can have the following observations. (1) For node-level tasks, performance first increases and then decreases with additional layers. On the Cora dataset, optimal performance consistently appears at 2 layers, demonstrating that this configuration achieves the best balance between node-level semantics and multi-layer subgraph semantics. Excessive layers may cause information loss due to over-smoothing. (2) For graph-level tasks, performance shows continuous improve- ment in the initial stages as layers increase. On the PROTEINS dataset, when L=3 or 4, the model still maintains strong perfor- mance, indicating that deeper architectures can provide additional benefits. This reflects graph-level tasks\u2019 stronger dependence on hierarchical features and validates the effectiveness of our hierar- chical prompt injection mechanism. Hidden dimensionality of coarsening net. We design an ef- ficient coarsening network to learn multi-scale information and enhance the model\u2019s generalization ability by adjusting the scale of the parameter space. To verify its effectiveness, we compare it under different hidden dimensions. As shown in Figure 6, in node classification, Cora is basically stable at \ud835\udc5f> 8, and all datasets peak when \ud835\udc5f= 8. As for graph classification, the model shows more robustness to dimension changes and already has excellent perfor- mance at \ud835\udc5f= 1. A slight overfitting occurs in the node classification task when \ud835\udc5f> 32. These phenomena indicate that the low-rank design of MSGCOT(\ud835\udc5f\u226a\ud835\udc51) significantly achieves an excellent balance between parameter efficiency and performance stability, Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Ziyu Zheng, et al. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 r 50 55 60 65 Accuracy(%) Cora Citeseer Photo Pubmed (a) Node classification 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 r 55 60 65 70 75 Accuracy(%) MUTAG BZR COX2 PROTEINS (b) Graph classification Figure 6:", "NY Ziyu Zheng, et al. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 r 50 55 60 65 Accuracy(%) Cora Citeseer Photo Pubmed (a) Node classification 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 r 55 60 65 70 75 Accuracy(%) MUTAG BZR COX2 PROTEINS (b) Graph classification Figure 6: The sensitivity of the hidden dimensions of the coarsening net. enabling the model to maintain strong generalization with minimal dimensional redundancy. 5.6 The Effectiveness of Multi-Scale Prompts To validate the effectiveness of multi-scale prompts, we evalu- ate a non-parametric variant (MSGCOT-P) that replaces the train- able coarsening network with precomputed multi-scale partitions [\ud835\udc461,\ud835\udc462, . . . ,\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc59] derived from graph coarsening algorithms [9]. This eliminates the need for learnable assignment matrices, reducing trainable parameters to only the node-level prompt components. Therefore, this version has smaller training parameters. As shown in Figures 7(a) and 7(b), MSGCOT-P achieves comparable or supe- rior results to GCOT across all datasets, with notable improvements on Photo (+1.69%) and MUTAG (+4.25%). While slightly trailing the parametric MSGCOT in most cases, it outperforms all other baselines, demonstrating that multi-scale reasoning drives perfor- mance gains. The strong performance of MSGCOT-P highlights the framework\u2019s adaptability to existing graph partitioning strategies.

The parameters of MSGCOT primarily come from the coarsening net- work, which consists of two low-rank decomposed matrices. For each layer, the number of parameters can be calculated as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f+ \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59. The total parameter count is \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f+ \u00cd\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc59=1 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59. Taking the first layer as an example, we compare the parameter counts with and without the lightweight coarsening network. As shown in Figure 6, node classification nearly reaches its optimal performance at \ud835\udc5f= 8, while graph classification achieves strong results even at \ud835\udc5f= 1. Here, we set \ud835\udc5f= 8 on the node task and r=1 on the graph task. As shown in the Table 3, the low-rank design maintains a stable parameter count of 0.43K-4.71K, whereas the full-rank design requires 43.15K-85.17K. The relative ratio is as low as 0.9% (COX2) and up to 6.1% (Cora), validating the efficiency of low-rank decomposition.

The experimental results in Table 4 demonstrate that MSGCOT sig- nificantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining model performance: For node classification tasks, its parameter count (10.37K-21.8K) represents a 47.1%-68.3% reduction compared to GCOT (32.76K), while being comparable to EdgePrompt+.

The experimental results in Table 4 demonstrate that MSGCOT sig- nificantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining model performance: For node classification tasks, its parameter count (10.37K-21.8K) represents a 47.1%-68.3% reduction compared to GCOT (32.76K), while being comparable to EdgePrompt+. The im- provement is even more pronounced in graph classification tasks, where the parameter count (1.17K-5.81K) shows a 29.1%-85.7% re- duction versus GCOT (8.19K), even outperforming single-step meth- ods like GPF+ (5.12K) on datasets such as MUTAG. This remarkable parameter efficiency stems from MSGCOT\u2019s innovative low-rank design (r=8 for node classification, r=1 for graph classification) and task-adaptive hierarchical coarsening mechanism, validating its advantage in balancing model complexity and performance. On av- erage, the parameter reduction reaches 53.6% for node classification and 63.2% for graph classification tasks.

We compare the per-epoch running time of dif- ferent prompt tuning methods across multiple datasets. The ex- perimental results in Table 5 demonstrate that MSGCOT exhibits distinct efficiency advantages across different task types. For node classification tasks, MSGCOT\u2019s per-epoch runtime is slightly higher than GPF+ and EdgePrompt+, but remains comparable to GCOT. In graph classification tasks, it achieves an average per-epoch runtime Beyond Single-Granularity Prompts: A Multi-Scale Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graph Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY of only 0.137 seconds, a 34.8% reduction compared to GCOT, while maintaining significant accuracy advantages. This stems from either the extremely low coarsening ratio or the reduced hidden dimen- sion in graph classification tasks. Although multi-step prompting inevitably introduces additional complexity, its runtime overhead remains within a controllable range.

The proposed low-rank coarsening network effectively captures hierarchical structural features while maintaining parameter effi- ciency. The method mimics the human thought process by gradually introducing different information from coarse to fine granularity during the prompt generation, ultimately generating more refined prompts. Experimental results show that compared to methods that only consider a single granularity, MSGCOT exhibits better perfor- mance, significantly outperforming existing benchmark methods.

While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset [LeBel et al., 2023]. We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping. 1 Introduction Non-invasive neuroimaging are central to cognitive neuroscience, yet each modality remains constrained by a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), for instance, which is sensitive to the magnetic field induced by postsynaptic current in groups of spatially aligned neurons, offers millisecond-scale temporal precision but suffers from poor spatial detail. Conversely, the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides millimeter-scale spatial maps but reflects a sluggish hemodynamic response that integrates neural activity over seconds [Hall et al., 2014] (Figure 1). Bridging their complementary strengths to obtain a unified, high spatiotemporal resolution view of neural source activity is critical for understanding complex processes such as speech comprehension, which recruits multiple subprocesses unfolding on the order of milliseconds across distributed cortical networks. However, effectively integrating MEG and fMRI remains an unsolved challenge, particularly for single- trial naturalistic data. Conventional source localization methods often use fMRI data to constrain the mathematically ill-posed MEG inverse problem. For example, fMRI activation maps can serve as spatial priors in minimum-norm estimation (MNE) to improve source localization [Liu et al., 1998, Dale et al., 2000, 1 arXiv:2510.09415v1 [q-bio.NC] 10 Oct 2025 Time Spatial Resolution Temporal Resolution fMRI Low High MEG Low High Source Estimates High High Our Model [Naturalistic Experiments] Figure 1: Integration of MEG and fMRI. Our work integrates the millisecond-level temporal precision of MEG with the millimeter-scale spatial specificity of fMRI to reconstruct cortical source activity at a high spatiotemporal resolution in naturalistic experiments. Suzuki and Yamashita, 2021, Moradi et", "Source Estimates High High Our Model [Naturalistic Experiments] Figure 1: Integration of MEG and fMRI. Our work integrates the millisecond-level temporal precision of MEG with the millimeter-scale spatial specificity of fMRI to reconstruct cortical source activity at a high spatiotemporal resolution in naturalistic experiments. Suzuki and Yamashita, 2021, Moradi et al., 2024]. While commonly used for simple, event-related designs, these approaches ignore the stimuli and are often ineffective in recovering the continuously evolving neural dynamics in more naturalistic settings. A more promising approach, called neurogenerative modeling, aims to directly model cortical sources and then generates MEG and fMRI signals forward [Huster et al., 2012]. Yet, prominent frameworks like The Virtual Brain often rely on complex biophysical models and anatomical connectomes, which requires much prior knowledge and makes parameter fitting inefficient. Furthermore, their focus has largely been on resting-state dynamics rather than encoding responses to external stimuli, limiting their applicability to task-based naturalistic experiments [Ritter et al., 2013, Patow et al., 2024, Hashemi et al., 2025]. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that combines the strength of the neurogenerative approach with deep learning-based encoding model paradigms. We propose a novel encoding model that predicts MEG and fMRI signals for multiple subjects as a function of stimulus features, constrained by the requirement that both modalities originate from the same source estimates in a latent source space. This is achieved by incorporating anatomical information and biophysical forward models for MEG and fMRI. Thus, we effectively estimate the source activity that is high-resolution in both time and space. Crucially, the resulting source estimates are intended to be approximations that are physiologically faithful to the true brain signals, rather than a transformation of them. Note that the ground-truth neural activity at this resolution is inaccessible given current non-invasive techniques. Instead, we validate our estimates by showing that they generalize across experiments and subjects to predict invasive data recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG) from epileptic patients. Although ECoG provides a very partial coverage of the brain, each electrode provides signals that are highly resolved in time and space, and is thus an ideal test bed for our estimated brain space. We find that our model can produce powerful predictions of ECoG signal, outperforming models trained 2 directly on ECoG data. This validates the promise of our approach at faithfully recovering the underlying brain source activity. 2 Methods 2.1 Source Space As a standard practice in source estimation, we first define source spaces that specify the location of possible neural sources. For each subject, we construct a subject-specific source space according to their structural MRI scan with an octahedron-based subsampling method from MNE-Python [Gramfort et al., 2014]. This process yields a set of equally spaced sources on the cortical surface1. We also define a source space on the \u201cfsaverage\u201d brain, a standard \u201caverage\u201d brain template in FreeSurfer [Fischl, 2012], using the same procedure. Furthermore, each source is modeled as an equivalent current dipole, a common approximation for the net postsynaptic currents generated by a small group of spatially aligned and synchronously firing neurons. Thus, source estimates refer to", "\u201cfsaverage\u201d brain, a standard \u201caverage\u201d brain template in FreeSurfer [Fischl, 2012], using the same procedure. Furthermore, each source is modeled as an equivalent current dipole, a common approximation for the net postsynaptic currents generated by a small group of spatially aligned and synchronously firing neurons. Thus, source estimates refer to the estimated amplitudes of these dipoles over time. We additionally assume that all dipoles are oriented perpendicularly to the brain surface. With these anatomically-derived source spaces, we compute two matrices. Using MNE-Python, we calculate the source morphing matrix M Si, which transforms the source estimates from the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space to subject Si\u2019s subject-specific source space. If Si has MEG recordings, we also compute the lead-field matrix LSi, which maps Si\u2019s source estimates to MEG sensor signals according to Maxwell\u2019s equations. 2.2 Model Architecture We build a transformer-based encoding model to predict MEG and fMRI simultaneously for multiple subjects from stimulus input and source estimates, as schematized in Figure 2. Input Layer We use three concatenated feature streams to represent the naturalistic stories and serve as model input. The first feature space consists of a 768-dimensional contextual word embedding, obtained from the seventh hidden layer of GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019] with a context window of 20 tokens. The second feature space is a phoneme feature space consisting of 44-dimensional one-hot vectors, where each dimension represents a phoneme in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary or a non-speech sound [LeBel et al., 2023]. The third feature space is a 40-dimensional space of mel-spectrograms spanning 0-10 kHz, representing the perceived audio sound. These yield feature vectors xt \u2208Rdstim with dstim = 852, sampled at 50 Hz. The contextual word embeddings are repeated for the entirety of the word duration, and the phoneme embedding is repeated for the entirety of the phoneme duration. Then, the feature vectors go through the linear input layer before entering the transformer: zin t = W inxt + bias, where zin t \u2208Rdmodel, W in \u2208Rdmodel\u00d7dstim and dmodel = 256. Transformer Encoder To capture the dependency between features and feature-dependent latency in neural responses, we use four standard transformer encoder layers with two heads, feed-forward size = 512, and dropout = 0.2. Each attention block uses a causal sliding window of 500 tokens, so that the transformer could make use of the preceding 10 s of the stimulus features. We add learnable positional embeddings to the keys within each attention block, so that the transformer can learn feature-dependent neural latency. 1This discretization is a standard step in source localization as the exact location of brain sources cannot be precisely pinpointed and has to be hypothesized as a mesh. 3 Input Layer Transformer \u00d7\ud835\udfd2 Source Layer A LOT OF PEOPLE EY L AA T AH V P IY P AH L ... ... ...

Feature streams enter the network through the input layer and traverse four transformer layers before being projected into the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space by the source layer. The source estimates in the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space is then transformed into subject-specific source estimates by the source morphing matrix. The MEG head predicts sensor signals by multiplying the source estimates with the lead-field matrix. The fMRI head predicts BOLD responses by convolving the downsampled envelope of the source estimates with a learnable hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel. The MEG and fMRI of multiple subjects (e.g., S1, S2, ...) are predicted simultaneously. Under the joint constraints of MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects, our model recovers the source estimates with high spatiotemporal resolution. Dashed arrows indicate steps that are pre-computed and not learnable. 4 Source Layer and Source Morphing The output of the transformer zout t \u2208Rdmodel is then projected to the source space through the linear source layer: st = W srczout t + bias, where st \u2208Rdsrc, W src \u2208Rdsrc\u00d7dmodel and dsrc = 8196. The resulting st would represent the source estimates at time t in the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space. To obtain subject-specific predictions, we then use the pre-computed source morphing matrix M Si \u2208Rdsrc\u00d7dsrc to transform st into Si\u2019s source estimates sSi t : sSi t = M Sist. MEG Head We get MEG sensor-wise prediction for Si by \u02c6mSi t = LSi sSi t , where \u02c6mSi t \u2208RdMEG and L \u2208RdMEG\u00d7dsrc is the pre-computed lead-field matrix for Si. Importantly, LSi contains subject-specific anatomical information and guarantees that sSi t represents the source estimates in our defined source space. This, together with M Si, in turn guarantees that st represents the source estimates in the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space. fMRI Head We calculate the envelope of source estimates as pSi t = |sSi t + j H(sSi t )| where H is the Hilbert transform and j is the imaginary unit. Then, we downsample pSi t and convolve it with a double- gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF; whose parameters are learnable) to yield source-level BOLD predictions \u02c6ySi \u03c4 \u2208Rdsrc for Si. Note that \u03c4 corresponds to the slower sampling rate of fMRI. 2.3 Stimuli 27 stories of \u201cMoth Radio Hour\u201d stories serve as stimuli, as in LeBel et al. [2023]. Each story has length around 10-15 minutes. These stories are partitioned into 21 training stories, one validation story, four test stories, and one anchor story. 2.4 MEG Data We recorded whole-head MEG from five subjects (S1\u2013S5) as they passively listened to the stories. The validation and test stories were presented twice and the anchor story five times, and the repetitions were averaged. Data were acquired on a MEGIN TRIUX scanner (dMEG", "and one anchor story. 2.4 MEG Data We recorded whole-head MEG from five subjects (S1\u2013S5) as they passively listened to the stories. The validation and test stories were presented twice and the anchor story five times, and the repetitions were averaged. Data were acquired on a MEGIN TRIUX scanner (dMEG = 306, 204 planar gradiometers, 102 magnetometers, 102 triple-sensor locations) at 1 kHz. The following preprocessing steps are performed with MNE-Python [Gramfort et al., 2013]: (1) temporal Signal Space Separation (tSSS) [Taulu and Simola, 2006]; (2) 1\u2013150 Hz band-pass and 60/120 Hz notch filters; (3) independent component analysis (ICA) [Hyvarinen, 1999] removal of ocular, cardiac, and audio signal artifacts; (4) downsampling to 50 Hz. We also collected an anatomical T1 scan for each subject, which we use to reconstruct the subject\u2019s cortical surface using FreeSurfer [Fischl, 2012]. 2.5 fMRI Data We use an open fMRI dataset [LeBel et al., 2023] where eight subjects (S6\u2013S13) underwent 3 T fMRI scans while passively listening to the stories. The reconstructed cortical surface of each subject based on the anatomical T1 scan and FreeSurfer [Fischl, 2012] is also provided. We project voxel-level data to the cortical surface using pycortex [Gao et al., 2015], and then average the nearest vertices of each source to get the source-level BOLD signals. 2.6 Model Training For training efficiency and memory usage, we divide training stories into pieces of 40 seconds and train with a batch size of 8. We use the last 20 seconds to calculate loss to ensure model\u2019s full exposure to past information. 5 Training loss L is defined as a weighed sum of MEG correlation loss (weighted by the repeatability of each sensor), fMRI correlation loss (weighted by the repeatability of each source), and smoothness loss Lsmooth: L = \u03b11 (1 \u2212corr(mt, \u02c6mt)) + \u03b12 (1 \u2212corr(y\u03c4, \u02c6y\u03c4)) + \u03b13Lsmooth where mt and y\u03c4 denote the MEG and fMRI data2 respectively, and Lsmooth is the mean squared difference between st and st\u22121. We set \u03b11 = 1 and \u03b13 = 0.0001 throughout the training. For the first 20 epochs, we set \u03b12 = 0 to let the model train only on MEG. For later epochs, we set \u03b12 = 1 to let the model train on MEG and fMRI jointly with equal importance. This MEG-first curriculum enables our model to quickly capture the complex temporal dynamics under the guidance of MEG, and then refine the spatial pattern under the constraint of fMRI. We validate our model on the validation story and perform early stopping according to the validation loss, which has the same format as L. 3 Predictive Performance We compare our model\u2019s predictive performance for MEG and fMRI against single-subject, single-modality linear encoding models. Since these models are not constrained by the other subject, the shared source space, or the other modality, they are not simple baselines to be surpassed, but rather a high-performance benchmark representing the upper limit (\u201cceiling\u201d) of what a linear model can achieve. MEG Ridge Ceiling: We shift the feature streams to represent the stimuli delayed by 0, 20, ..., 600 ms,", "source space, or the other modality, they are not simple baselines to be surpassed, but rather a high-performance benchmark representing the upper limit (\u201cceiling\u201d) of what a linear model can achieve. MEG Ridge Ceiling: We shift the feature streams to represent the stimuli delayed by 0, 20, ..., 600 ms, and then use these 31 stimulus embedding matrices to train a stacked ridge regression model for each MEG sensor [Lin et al., 2024]. fMRI Ridge Ceiling: We concatenate features delayed by 2, 4, 6, and 8 s and fit a ridge regression for the source-level BOLD signals. This is the same model used for denoising training fMRI data (see Section 2.5). We evaluate our model and the two Ridge Ceiling models by calculating the Pearson correlation r between predicted and actual signals on held-out test stories for each subject. For MEG, we report r per sensor; for fMRI, we report r per source. The results show that our model is comparable to both Ridge Ceiling models (Figure 3 shows S1 and S6 for example). For S1\u2019s MEG, over temporal lobe sensors, the MEG Ridge Ceiling attains r = 0.074 \u00b1 0.041 whereas our model reaches r = 0.109 \u00b1 0.064. For S6\u2019s fMRI, the fMRI Ridge Ceiling yields r = 0.267 \u00b1 0.074 across the top quartile of sources, while our model achieves r = 0.236 \u00b1 0.072. The results for other subjects are reported in the appendix. We find that our model performs better than the MEG Ridge Ceiling, probably because the transformer encoder and the positional embeddings added to the keys enable our model to better capture nonlinearities and feature-dependent neural latency. However, our model performs slightly worse than the fMRI Ridge Ceiling, which might due to the fact that our model forces all subjects to share a common \u201cfsaverage\u201d source estimates and does not have a mechanism to allow for spatial variance across subjects. Crucially, unavailable from either Ridge Ceiling models, our model delivers cortical source estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. 4 Simulation Experiments To test the fidelity of our source estimates under controlled conditions, we use the story feature streams to generate synthetic source activity from a linear model whose weights are randomly sampled according to the empirical feature covariance, with different lags applied to word embeddings, phonemes, and spectrograms to mimic hierarchical processing in the brain. From the synthetic source activity, we then generate MEG and 2For more effective training, we denoise the fMRI data for training stories using the predicted BOLD signals from the fMRI linear encoding model in Section 3. Note that we still use the non-denoised fMRI data for validation and evaluation. 6 Our Model Ridge Ceiling Our Model Correlation between Predicted and Actual MEG (S1) Ridge Ceiling Correlation between Predicted and Actual fMRI (S6) Figure 3: Predictive performance on MEG and fMRI for two example subjects.

Both magnetometer and gradiometer sensors above the temporal lobe are predicted. Bottom: performance on the source-level BOLD signals of S6, shown on the inflated surface. Large parts of bilateral temporal and frontal areas are predicted. fMRI signals at different noise levels measured by contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR): \u221e(noiseless) / 1 / 0.1 for MEG and \u221e(noiseless) / 0.3 for fMRI3. We train our model on the simulated MEG and fMRI of the training stories, and evaluate the source estimates of the test stories. We calculate the Pearson r between the source estimates with the ground truth along the temporal dimension or the spatial dimension. We compare our model against fMRI-weighted MNE (fMNE) [Liu et al., 1998], which is built upon classical MNE framework [H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Ilmoniemi, 1994] and incorporates fMRI activity to allow sources with higher BOLD responses to be more active. Figure 4 shows that our model recovers source activity more accurately than fMNE at all noise levels in both time and space. 5 ECoG Prediction To validate the generalizability of our model, we test its predictive performance on a novel \u201cPodcast\u201d ECoG dataset [Zada et al., 2025], which features unseen subjects and a different neural recording modality. ECoG, which comes from a small contact in the brain, provides signals with high spatiotemporal resolution, serving as a valuable proxy for ground-truth source activity. In this dataset, neural activity was recorded from nine subjects via intracranial electrodes as they listened to a 30-minute audio podcast. Following the methodology described in Section 2.2, we extract semantic, phoneme, and spectrogram features from the audio stimulus. These features are then input into our trained model to generate source estimates in the \u201cfsaverage\u201d source space. 3We define CNR as the ratio of the standard deviation of signal and noise: CNR = \u03c3signal/\u03c3noise [Welvaert and Rosseel, 2013]. We choose these CNR levels because the mean CNR in our MEG data is around 0.1 and the mean CNR in our fMRI data is around 0.3. 7 Correlation between Source Estimates and Ground Truth Figure 4: Results of simulation experiments. We report the mean Pearson r computed over time within each source (left panel, temporal correlation) and over sources at each time point (right panel, spatial correlation) between the source estimates and the ground truth. Our model outperforms fMNE in both aspects under all noise levels. Zero-Shot Prediction for ECoG First, we test the model\u2019s ability to generate zero-shot predictions for ECoG signals. To achieve this, we map the electrode locations to the \u201cfsaverage\u201d surface and assign the time series of the nearest estimated source as the zero-shot prediction of that electrode. We then evaluate these predictions with two analyses. First, we calculate the Pearson r between each predicted and actual electrode time series, with statistical significance assessed via a permutation test. The results reveal that 916 of 1268 electrodes showed a significant correlation,", "source as the zero-shot prediction of that electrode. We then evaluate these predictions with two analyses. First, we calculate the Pearson r between each predicted and actual electrode time series, with statistical significance assessed via a permutation test. The results reveal that 916 of 1268 electrodes showed a significant correlation, with the most accurately predicted electrodes located over the superior temporal sulcus (Figure 5, top left panel). Second, we design a binary classification task. For each electrode, we randomly select a one-minute prediction segment and calculate its absolute Pearson r with the true corresponding ECoG segment as well as with a distractor (a non-corresponding segment from the same electrode). We then measure how accurately the true segment could be identified by its higher correlation. Repeating this process 1000 times, we use the binomial test to determine significance. This evaluation finds that 683 of 1268 electrodes perform significantly above chance (Figure 5, middle left panel). Trained Prediction for ECoG In addition to zero-shot predictions, we also train a linear mapping from the source estimates to the ECoG signals. Using a three-fold cross-validation scheme, we set aside 10 minutes of ECoG data as the test set in each fold. We then train a ridge regression model to predict each electrode from our source estimates using a varying proportion of the remaining data for training. We compare the performance of this approach against a linear encoding model for ECoG trained directly on stimulus features using stacked ridge regression [Lin et al., 2024]. As illustrated in Figure 5, when provided with an equal amount of training data, the predictions derived from our model\u2019s source estimates consistently outperform the linear encoding model. This suggests that our model provides a powerful inductive bias, generating representations that can be more readily mapped to neural activity. Notably, the performance at a training proportion of zero percent corresponds to the zero-shot prediction described in the last paragraph. In this scenario, our model\u2019s advantage is most pronounced, substantially outperforming the randomly initialized linear encoding model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that our model\u2019s source estimates generalize effectively to new subjects and modalities, faithfully representing underlying cortical activity. 8 Correlation with Actual ECoG Accuracy of Binary Classification Task for Zero-Shot Prediction Correlation with Actual ECoG Correlation Difference with Linear Encoding Model Correlation Difference with Linear Encoding Model ECoG Zero-Shot Prediction ECoG Prediction after Training (Training Proportion 100%) Figure 5: Predictive performance on a new ECoG dataset.

Bottom: Correlation map of our model\u2019s trained prediction with 100% training data and electrode-wise correlation difference with the linear encoding model. 9 6 Related Work Source Localization MNE [H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Ilmoniemi, 1994], beamformers [Van Veen et al., 1997], and Bayesian approaches [Wipf and Nagarajan, 2009] are classic source localization methods for MEG/EEG. To improve spatial precision, a common strategy is to incorporate fMRI data, using activation maps as spatial priors to bias source estimates toward hemodynamically active regions [Liu et al., 1998, Dale et al., 2000, Liu and He, 2008, Xu et al., 2018, Henson et al., 2010, Suzuki and Yamashita, 2021, Moradi et al., 2024]. However, these methods are typically applied to each time point separately and they do not leverage information from the sensory input by design, making them less suitable for tracking the rich neural dynamics elicited by naturalistic stimuli. Multimodal Fusion Instead of using fMRI to inform MEG/EEG inversion, multimodal fusion methods use symmetric models to jointly assess information from both modalities. For example, joint independent component analysis and joint tensor/matrix decomposition on MEG and fMRI could identify shared latent spatiotemporal components [Calhoun et al., 2006, Belyaeva et al., 2024]. Another popular approach is to align MEG and fMRI using representation similarity analysis, so that researchers can pinpoint MEG within a time window to particular cortical regions [Cichy et al., 2014, Cichy and Oliva, 2020, Leonardelli and Fairhall, 2022, Yeh et al., 2024]. However, these methods do not yield a direct, high-resolution estimate of the underlying neural source activity itself, nor do they explicitly model how that activity is driven by stimulus features. Neurogenerative Modeling Conceptually similar to our approach, neurogenerative modeling builds models for latent neural sources and uses biophysical forward models to generate neuroimaging data [Huster et al., 2012, Castaldo et al., 2023, Kang and Park, 2024]. For example, The Virtual Brain specifies parameterized neural mass models for cortical regions, obtains connectivity between regions from anatomical scans, uses lead-field matrices and hemodynamic functions to generate MEG/EEG and fMRI data, and fits parameters to observed data [Ritter et al., 2013, Patow et al., 2024, Hashemi et al., 2025]. Key distinctions from our work are that these frameworks often rely heavily on prior knowledge about neural circuits, require complicated Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, and have primarily focused on resting-state dynamics rather than stimulus encoding. Encoding Models for Language Voxel-wise or channel-wise linear encoding with single word or contextual embeddings has mapped semantic and syntactic processing in fMRI [Wehbe et al., 2014a, Huth et al., 2016, Toneva and Wehbe, 2019, Schrimpf et al., 2021, Reddy and Wehbe, 2021, Toneva et al., 2022, Caucheteux and King, 2022, Tang et al., 2023] and MEG [Wehbe et al., 2014b, Toneva and Wehbe, 2019, Toneva et al., 2022, Caucheteux and King, 2022]. These methods have mapped between embeddings and brain activity, pinpointing in the brain that are predicted by the information in the embeddings, and time points in which they are predicted. While MEG results have allowed researchers to paint somewhat of a spatiotemporal picture, it remains limited", "Caucheteux and King, 2022]. These methods have mapped between embeddings and brain activity, pinpointing in the brain that are predicted by the information in the embeddings, and time points in which they are predicted. While MEG results have allowed researchers to paint somewhat of a spatiotemporal picture, it remains limited in the spatial resolution that it offers. The fMRI results, though with a high spatial resolution, still remain unconnected to the temporal course. Even those works that have used both fMRI and MEG have not combined them beyond comparing their results [e.g., Caucheteux and King, 2022]. 7 Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work We have presented a transformer-based encoding model that successfully recovers source activity from naturalistic, multi-subject MEG and fMRI recordings. Our model demonstrates high predictive accuracy for held-out data, and its source estimates with high spatiotemporal resolution are validated through simulation 10 experiments and ECoG prediction. By combining MEG and fMRI with a naturalistic encoding model, our work opens new avenues for non-invasively probing the dynamics of language and cognition without sacrificing spatial or temporal fidelity. Our work has two limitations that point to future research. First, the current model relies on raw phoneme and spectrum features. While effective, incorporating contextualized representations from pretrained large audio-language models (e.g., Whisper [Radford et al., 2023]) could potentially improve the model\u2019s performance. Second, our source space is constrained to surface dipoles with fixed orientations. This simplification prevents the model from capturing activity subcortical structures or from non-perpendicular cortical sources. Future work should incorporate volumetric or hybrid surface\u2013volume source spaces with orientation freedom to improve neuroanatomical fidelity. 11 References Irina Belyaeva, Ben Gabrielson, Yu-Ping Wang, Tony W Wilson, Vince D Calhoun, Julia M Stephen, and T\u00fclay Adali.

As shown in the table, in the validation set, our four-layer model outperforms the three-layer model and the five-layer model. Similarly, two attention heads yield the lowest validation loss, compared with one head or four heads. Although these results support our chosen architecture, we wish to note that the optimal hyperparameters will likely vary depending on factors such as dataset size and stimulus complexity, and we encourage researchers to perform their own tuning when adapting our framework for specific applications.

Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM for the task. 1 Introduction How can we select the best Large Language Model (LLM) for a given application or data distribution without retraining? Answering this question has become increasingly difficult as the number of readily available models continues to expand. Recent advances in architectures, training strategies, and access to massive datasets have enabled impressive zero-shot capabilities, allowing LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning (Wei et al.; Kojima et al., 2022). As a result, a large and diverse collection of pretrained models differing in architecture, training data, and optimization objectives is now easily acces- sible through academic repositories and commercial platforms (Hugging Face; OpenAI; Google DeepMind; Anthropic). This abundance of choice, while offering wide flexibility for deployment, also introduces a fundamental challenge for practitioners as the performance differences across these LLMs can be substantial, particularly when transferring across domains, tasks, or languages (Liang et al., 2023). Although significant efforts have been devoted to the evaluation and benchmarking of LLMs (Liang et al., 2023; Fourrier et al., 2024; OpenCompass, 2023), the rapid expansion of both candidate models and evaluation scenarios makes existing practices increasingly difficult to apply for model selection (Chang et al., 2024). In particular, benchmarks often struggle to keep pace with the fast release cycle of new models or frequently focus on narrow or standardized tasks, which may not adequately capture the requirements of domain-specific applications. A common approach to model selection is to rely on random or heuristically chosen small subsets of annotated data (Polo et al., 2024; Vivek et al., 2024), but such approaches often result in suboptimal use of resources and fail to reliably capture differences across models (Kossen et al., 2021). To address this, several studies have explored active model selection (Karimi et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2020; Okanovic et al., 2025; Gardner et al., 2015; Tahan et al., 2024), where limited annotations of strategically chosen subsets are utilized, but this line of work is largely centered around classification tasks rather than generative settings (Okanovic 1The source code is available at https://github.com/RobustML-Lab/llm-selector 1 arXiv:2510.09418v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Queries Candidate LLMs Model Responses 3.

For an arbitrary pool of n queries and a set of candidate language models, LLM SELECTOR adaptively annotates most informative b \u226an queries for identifying the best lan- guage model for the pool. et al., 2025; Kay et al., 2025; Madani et al., 2012; Karimi et al., 2021; Piratla et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Kassraie et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024a,b). Thus, to date, how to reliably identify the best LLM for a specific task and data distribution under limited annotation resources remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem and ask: Given a pool of queries and a set of candidate LLMs, which examples should be annotated in order to reliably identify the best LLM, both in a model-agnostic and annotation-efficient manner? Contributions: In this paper, we introduce the active model selection problem for LLMs and present LLM SELECTOR, a principled framework for selecting the best LLM under a limited annotation budget, along with adapted baseline strategies for this problem. Given a large set of n queries and a limited annotation budget b with b \u226an, LLM SELECTOR selects b queries whose annotations are expected to maximally reduce uncertainty about the best model for the entire set. Our approach builds on information-gain criteria (Chen et al., 2015), and quantifies informativeness using a two-parameter model that measures information gain as Shannon\u2019s mutual information between the unknown best model and annotations. Motivated by the growing adoption of judge-based approaches (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024c, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023), we employ a judge-based annotation process in which each query is annotated with a vector over candidate models. For each model candidate, we compare its response to the query against that of a baseline model using oracle preference judgments. This judge-based design alleviates the need for costly reference answers or summaries that are known to be far more expensive than pairwise judgments (Zopf, 2018; Ouyang et al., 2022a; Rafailov et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2022; Callison-Burch et al., 2006), and mitigates the noise commonly introduced by reference-based evaluation metrics (Zopf, 2018; Ouyang et al., 2022a; Rafailov et al., 2023; Novikova et al., 2017). We validate LLM SELECTOR across 6 benchmarks on 151 LLMs. Specifically, our evaluation covers three categories of datasets: (i) general dialogue: AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024c), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023); (ii) vision-language: Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) and Bingo (Cui et al., 2023); and (iii) medical: MediQA (Ben Abacha et al., 2019). These benchmarks employ LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation, which has been shown to", "dialogue: AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024c), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023); (ii) vision-language: Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) and Bingo (Cui et al., 2023); and (iii) medical: MediQA (Ben Abacha et al., 2019). These benchmarks employ LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation, which has been shown to correlate strongly with human evaluations, even exceeding the agreement level between human annotators (Zheng et al., 2023). Importantly, our method does not rely on LLM judges specifically and is equally compatible with other oracle judges, such as human evaluators or alternative assessment methods. LLM SELECTOR shows consistently competitive performance across all experiments, while providing sig- nificant reductions in annotation costs on several datasets, with only a small fraction of the annotation budget required by baseline selection strategies where it reduces the annotation costs by up to 58.33%, while achieving a 59.62% reduction when selecting models within a 1% win-rate vicinity of the best model. Moreover, we show that LLM SELECTOR can find near-best models even before exhausting the budget needed to reach the best model, indicating that LLM SELECTOR maintains robust performance under extreme budget 2 constraints. Once the best LLM is selected based on b annotated queries, we use it to generate outputs for the re- maining n \u2212b queries where n \u2212b \u226bb. Our method is fully model-agnostic: it requires no access to internal parameters and imposes no restrictions on output format, making it directly applicable in black-box or API-only settings. An overview of LLM SELECTOR is shown in Figure 1. 2 Related Work Several methodologies exist for LLM evaluation. Traditional multiple-choice (Srivastava et al., 2022; Suzgun et al., 2022), or short-answer benchmarks (Cobbe et al., 2021) provide a standardized way to evaluate model performance, though they do not assess the generative abilities of LLMs. For tasks such as summarization (See et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018) and translation (Goyal et al., 2022), reference-based benchmarks are commonly used, where model outputs are compared against human-written ground truth using metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). More recently, judge-based evaluation has seen growing adoption. LMArena (Zheng et al., 2023) is a live leaderboard using human annotators. Static benchmarks like Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024c), AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023) and MT- Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) rely on LLM-as-a-Judge for automated evaluation. At a higher level, leaderboards such as HELM (Liang et al., 2023), OpenCompass (OpenCompass, 2023), and OpenLLM (Fourrier et al., 2024) aggregate benchmarks measuring models on different capabilities in order to give a full view of LLM capabilities. However, these evaluation methodologies require relying on full access to human annotators or LLM-as-a-Judge, and due to the large scale of modern benchmarks, such evaluations are often not feasible with limited resources. Most prior work on active model selection focus on classification tasks (Zhao et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2020; Gardner et al., 2015; Okanovic et al., 2025; Kay et al., 2025). Some studies consider an online setting, where data arrive sequentially from a stream (Madani et al., 2012; Karimi", "resources. Most prior work on active model selection focus on classification tasks (Zhao et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2020; Gardner et al., 2015; Okanovic et al., 2025; Kay et al., 2025). Some studies consider an online setting, where data arrive sequentially from a stream (Madani et al., 2012; Karimi et al., 2021; Piratla et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Kassraie et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024a,b; Xia et al., 2024b). Active model selection has also been studied for LLMs, but limited to scenarios with two candidate models (Tahan et al., 2024) or a single model under active testing (Berrada et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025). In contrast, our method, LLM SELECTOR, can handle an arbitrary number of candidate LLMs. Finally, while some prior work explores efficient active ranking based on comparisons (Jamieson & Nowak, 2011; Caron & Doucet, 2012), they primarily select pairs of models for evaluation. By contrast, our setup compares models on LLM queries spanning diverse levels of difficulty, where the outcome of the evaluation depends on the query itself. This motivates a data-centric perspective in which we prioritize selecting examples for annotation rather than model pairs. 3 LLM Selector In this section, we introduce LLM SELECTOR. We first define the problem setting in Section 3.1, and describe our annotation framework based on preference judgments in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, we present LLM SELECTOR algorithm for annotation-efficient LLM selection. Finally, Section 3.4 details our hyperparameter selection strategy, which requires no oracle annotations. 3.1 Problem Setting Consider the inference-time scenario in which we are provided with a set of n unannotated queries Q = {qi \u2208Q | i \u2208[n]}. Each query qi represents a user-issued prompt or request to an oracle. We denote the oracle-annotated ground-truth response to qi by ri \u2208R. Since these annotations are not observed, we use Ri to denote the unknown response ri. 3 Given a collection of m pretrained language models M = {fj : Q \u2192R | j \u2208[m]}, our objective is to identify the best language model in M for producing high-quality responses to the queries Q. Because oracle- provided annotations are costly, we assume access to only a limited number of at most b \u226an annotations. The problem therefore reduces to selecting b queries whose annotations provide maximal information about the identity of the best model. We define the best model, denoted by f \u2217, as the model with the highest utility among M if all annotations {ri | i \u2208[n]} were observed. Once identified, we deploy this model to generate responses for the remaining n \u2212b unannotated queries. Formally, we cast the selection problem as one of maximizing mutual information. That is, we aim to identify a subset A \u2286{(qi, ri) | i \u2208[n]} of at most b annotated examples that maximizes the mutual information between F and the selected annotations: Aopt[b] = arg max A\u2286{(qi,ri)|i\u2208[n]} |A|\u2264b I(F; A).

(1) 3.2 Annotation via Direct Preference Judgments The evaluation of long-form candidate responses cannot rely on exact string matching, and therefore re- quires more sophisticated methods. Beyond correctness, factors such as relevance, helpfulness, complexity, and level of detail influence the desirability of an answer. Because reference-based metrics often produce noisy scores (Novikova et al., 2017; Callison-Burch et al., 2006), we instead evaluate models using direct preference judgments (Zheng et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023), which compare model responses pairwise and is shown to be more stable than individual model ratings (Jones et al., 2011; Zopf, 2018). As for LLMs, the preference-based is already being adopted as the evaluation method in many open-ended contemporary LLM benchmarks (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024c, 2023). Formally, for a given query qi \u2208Q, an oracle judge performs a pairwise comparison between the responses of the models fj and fk. We write >, <, and = to denote the oracle judge\u2019s preference relation, with the following outcomes: \u2022 fj(qi) > fk(qi): the response of fj is preferred, \u2022 fj(qi) < fk(qi): the response of fk is preferred, \u2022 fj(qi) = fk(qi): the responses are judged equally good (or equally poor). We express the pairwise judgment of the oracle as OracleJudge(qi, fj(\u00b7), fk(\u00b7)) = 1[fj(qi) > fk(qi)] + 1 2 \u00b7 1[fj(qi) = fk(qi)], where 1[\u00b7] denotes the indicator function. To compare two models across a collection of queries, we adopt the win rate metric (Li et al., 2023). For the query set Q, the win rate of fj over fk is defined as WRQ(fj, fk) = 1 n n X i=1 OracleJudge(qi, fj(\u00b7), fk(\u00b7)) with WRQ(fj, fk) + WRQ(fk, fj) = 1 for j, k \u2208[m]. Since identifying the best model through full pairwise ranking requires O(m2) oracle annotations, we instead adopt a simplified strategy based on comparisons against a single baseline. Specifically, we designate one of the language models in M as baseline model to reduce the annotation cost further. We denote the baseline model by \u00aff. We select a candidate LLM expected to perform strongly as the baseline, aiming to produce a more informative ranking. We provide details of baseline model selection in Section 4.1. Each remaining model is then evaluated according to its win rate relative to \u00aff, and LLM SELECTOR returns the model the model with the highest win rate based on the annotated queries. To formally characterize the mutual information between the unknown best model and the annotations, we propose a two-parameter model that describes the behavior of the unknown best language model relative 4 to the baseline, with respect to the oracle preference relation introduced earlier: P(F(q) < \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = \u03f5loss P(F(q) = \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = \u03f5draw P(F(q) > \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = 1 \u2212\u03f5loss \u2212\u03f5draw (2) where \u03f5loss, \u03f5draw \u2208[0, 1] and \u03f5loss + \u03f5draw \u22641. The values of \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw are determined in", "preference relation introduced earlier: P(F(q) < \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = \u03f5loss P(F(q) = \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = \u03f5draw P(F(q) > \u00aff(q)|F = f \u2217) = 1 \u2212\u03f5loss \u2212\u03f5draw (2) where \u03f5loss, \u03f5draw \u2208[0, 1] and \u03f5loss + \u03f5draw \u22641. The values of \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw are determined in advance, following the procedure described in Section 3.4. 3.3 The Algorithm Given the query set Q, our objective is to select at most b queries such that, once annotated, they maximize our information about the best language model as defined in Equation 1. To this end, we adopt a sequential information maximization strategy (Chen et al., 2015; Okanovic et al., 2025) for selecting queries one at a time until the budget b is exhausted. In our sequential framework, let Ut denote the pool of unannotated queries, and At the set of annotated queries accumulated up to the sequential step t with U0 = Q and A0 = \u2205. At each t, we select the next query qt to annotate as follows: qt = arg max q\u2208Ut I(F; R | At, q) = arg max q\u2208Ut H(F | At) \u2212ER[H(F | At \u222a{(q, R)})] = arg min q\u2208Ut ER[H(F | At \u222a{(q, R)})] , (3) where H(F | At) denotes the conditional entropy of F given the annotations observed up to step t. Selecting the next query reduces to finding the query that minimizes the expected conditional entropy of F given the current annotations as in Equation 3. As oracle responses for unannotated queries are un- available, we compute this expectation through noisy annotation of the responses to each q \u2208Ut using weak judges. 3.3.1 Noisy Annotations via Weak Judges The intuition behind the noisy annotation approach is to evaluate a candidate response by comparing it against the set of possible model responses, assigning higher preference to those that has greater similarity to other candidates. Formally, we tokenize each response as a sequence of words: (w1, w2, . . . , wL). For a given k \u2208N, we construct a language model based on k-grams. The estimated probability of a word wl in this language model is determined by the previous k \u22121 words where P(wl|w1:L) := P(wl|wl\u2212k+1:l\u22121). We fit the k-gram model on the responses of the candidate models M, independently for each query q. For computing the average sequence likelihood of a sequence, we average the word probabilities: P(w1, w2, . . . , wL) = 1 L L X l=1 P(wl|wl\u2212k+1:l\u22121). Comparison of models f and \u00aff by a weak judge is done by choosing the response with the higher average likelihood, P(fj(q)) or P( \u00aff(q)). The weak judge decision with k-gram model is denoted as f(q) >(k) \u00aff(q), f(q) =(k) \u00aff(q) or f(q) <(k) \u00aff(q). We use r(k) to represent the noisy annotation made by weak judge k. Based on the weak judge decision and parameter model in Equation 2, we can compute the estimated information gain through the following probability: P(F = fj|At \u222a{(q, r(k))}) \u221d\u03f5 1[fj(q)<(k) \u00af f(q)] loss \u00b7 \u03f5 1[fj(q)=(k) \u00af f(q)] draw \u00b7 (1", "represent the noisy annotation made by weak judge k.

Given H(F|At \u222a {(q, r(k))}), the estimated entropy by a weak judge, we compute the expected entropy by averaging over all weak judges: qt = arg min q\u2208Ut 1 z z X k=1 H(F|A \u222a{(q, r(k))}) where we use a uniform distribution over weak judges for computing the expectation. 3.3.2 Updating Model Posterior Belief After annotating the selected query at step t, we update the posterior belief over the best language model conditioned on all annotations observed up to time t: P(F = fj|At \u222a{(q, R = r)}) \u221dP(At \u222a{(q, R = r)}|F = fj) \u00b7 P(F = fj).

As a replacement, we use ensemble of all weak judges as a noisy oracle. More specifically, the noisy oracle behaves as follows: 6 WeakJudges(q, f(q), \u00aff(q)) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 1 if \u03bd \u22652/3 // win 0.5 if 2/3 > \u03bd \u22651/3 // draw 0 otherwise // loss where \u03bd = 1 z Pz k=1 1[f(q) >(k) \u00aff(q)] + 1 2 \u00b7 1[f(q) =(k) \u00aff(q)]. We perform a grid search over \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw using the weak judge decisions as the ground-truth annota- tions. We select the parameter set that maximizes the identification probability, defined as the probability of correctly recognizing the best LLM under the budget b. 4 Experiments In our experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of strategies using", "over \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw using the weak judge decisions as the ground-truth annota- tions. We select the parameter set that maximizes the identification probability, defined as the probability of correctly recognizing the best LLM under the budget b. 4 Experiments In our experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of strategies using LLM-as-a-Judge as the oracle. LLM- based evaluation serves as a reliable oracle, demonstrating strong correlation with human judgment. More- over, LLM annotations maintain high efficiency while providing consistent and trustworthy feedback, making them a scalable and practical choice for our evaluation setting. 4.1 Dataset and Model Collections We conduct experiments on several datasets including AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024c), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), which contain general user dialogues; Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) and Bingo (Cui et al., 2023), which are vision\u2013language datasets; and MediQA (Ben Abacha et al., 2019), which focuses on medical question answering. AlpacaEval consists of 805 queries, on which we evaluate 53 LLMs. Arena-Hard contains 500 queries, with evaluations conducted on 68 LLMs. MT-Bench comprises 80 multi-turn dialogues, and we assess 6 LLMs. For Flickr30k, we use 1,000 test samples and evaluate 51 LLMs. Bingo includes 762 samples, with evaluations over 31 LLMs. Finally, MediQA contains 150 samples, on which we evaluate 9 LLMs. Candidate models include LLMs from diverse families, including proprietary systems such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (Ouyang et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a), Claude 2/3 (Anthropic, 2023, 2024), and Gemini (Google, 2023), as well as open-weight architectures like LLaMA-2/3 (Touvron et al., 2023; Meta AI, 2024), Mistral and Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2023, 2024), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), Yi (Young et al., 2024), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), Gemma (Google, 2024), InternLM (InternLM, 2023), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and DBRX (Databricks, 2024). We further consider several widely adopted instruction-tuned derivatives, including Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2023), Tulu-2 (Ivison et al., 2023), WizardLM (Xu et al., 2024), Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2024), and Starling (Zhu et al., 2024). The chosen LLMs differ in both number of parameters and training methodology. The performance of the candidate LLMs is plotted in Figure 2. The plots show the histogram of models which are in the different win rate ranges for each dataset. The histograms show that experiments include a diverse range of win rates against the baseline. This indicates that our experiments cover different scenarios and capture the variability present in real-world applications. For text-only benchmarks, we employ GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b) as the oracle judge. For vision\u2013language benchmarks, we rely on Prometheus-Vision (Lee et al., 2024a) as the oracle judge. For each dataset, we adopt the following baseline LLMs. AlpacaEval, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench follow the baselines specified by their respective benchmarks: text davinci-003, gpt-4-0314, and gpt-3.5-turbo, respectively. For the remaining datasets, we select as the baseline the LLM that achieves the highest performance under noisy annotations from WeakJudges. Specifically, we use gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0514 for Flickr30k, and gpt-4o-2024-05-13 for both Bingo and MediQA. We choose the parameters \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw independently for each", "text davinci-003, gpt-4-0314, and gpt-3.5-turbo, respectively. For the remaining datasets, we select as the baseline the LLM that achieves the highest performance under noisy annotations from WeakJudges. Specifically, we use gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0514 for Flickr30k, and gpt-4o-2024-05-13 for both Bingo and MediQA. We choose the parameters \u03f5loss and \u03f5draw independently for each dataset, based on the procedure de- scribed in Section 3.4. Based on preliminary analysis, we set the number of weak judges z to 10 in all experiments, as additional weak judges beyond this number are highly correlated with the existing ones and provide little new information. 7 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models Arena-Hard 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models AlpacaEval 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models MT-Bench 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models Flickr30k 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models Bingo 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 0 3 6 9 12 15 Number of Models MEDIQA Figure 2: Candidate LLM win rate histograms. 4.2 Baselines We evaluate LLM SELECTOR against a set of baseline strategies we adapt for the active model selection task. Random. At time t, the query qt is selected uniformly from the unannotated set Ut: qt \u223cUniform(Ut). Bradley-Terry. Bradley\u2013Terry coefficients (Bradley & Terry, 1952) are computed using annotated queries At to model LLM performances, which defines a posterior distribution over the best model. In our setting, we leverage this posterior together with entropy minimization strategy. The next query is selected by greedily minimizing the posterior entropy: qt = arg minq\u2208Ut 1 z Pz k=1 H(F|At \u222a{(q, r(k))}) Most Draws. For each q \u2208Ut, let d(q) denote the number of responses that result in a draw with the base- line response according to the ensemble WeakJudges. The next query is selected as qt = arg maxq\u2208Ut d(q). Uncertainty. We adapt the uncertainty-based sampling method of Dagan & Engelson (1995) to our set- ting. For each q \u2208Ut, let w(q), \u2113(q), and d(q) denote the expected number of wins, losses, and draws against the baseline, as estimated by the ensemble WeakJudges. Normalizing by the total number of responses nq, we obtain the empirical outcome distribution \u03c0q = ( w(q) nq , \u2113(q) nq , d(q) nq ). The next query is selected as the one with the highest entropy: qt = arg maxq\u2208Ut H(\u03c0q). Confidence. Using the same distribution \u03c0q, the next query is selected as the one with the lowest entropy: qt = arg minq\u2208Ut H(\u03c0q). Among the baseline strategies, only Bradley-Terry is adaptive, as its selection rule depends on the ob- served annotations. The remaining strategies are non-adaptive. 4.3 Experimental Setup In our experiments, we uniformly sample a pool of n examples from the test set. We run model selection strategies on the sampled", "H(\u03c0q). Among the baseline strategies, only Bradley-Terry is adaptive, as its selection rule depends on the ob- served annotations. The remaining strategies are non-adaptive. 4.3 Experimental Setup In our experiments, we uniformly sample a pool of n examples from the test set. We run model selection strategies on the sampled pool to select b queries to annotate, and choose the LLM with the highest average utility on the annotated queries. We call this process a realization, and we evaluate selection strategies on multiple realizations to obtain a performance estimate. We compare strategies by three metrics. Identification probability is defined as the ratio of experiments that correctly find the best model for a given budget b. We present results for b = 1, . . . , n. Annotation 8 efficiency refers to the percentage reduction in the number of labels needed to identify the best or reach within a \u03b4 vicinity of the best model across all realizations. 95th Percentile Win Rate Gap is the 95th percentile of the win rate difference of the chosen LLMs, compared to the absolute best LLM. 4.4 Results 4.4.1 Identification Probability 0 25 50 75 100 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability 58.33% Arena-Hard 0 25 50 75 100 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability AlpacaEval 0 2 4 6 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability 40.00% MT-Bench 0 50 100 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability Flickr30k 0 50 100 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability Bingo 0 50 100 Labeling budget b 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Identification probability 50.40% MEDIQA LLM Selector Random Bradley-Terry Confidence Uncertainty Most Draws Figure 3: Best model identification probability of LLM SELECTOR and the baselines. We present the best model identification probability of LLM SELECTOR and baseline methods in Fig- ure 3. On Arena-Hard, MediQA, and MT-Bench, LLM SELECTOR achieves 100% identification probability with 58.33%, 50.40%, and 40.00% fewer annotated queries compared to the best competing baseline, re- spectively. On the remaining benchmarks, LLM SELECTOR requires a similar number of labels as the strongest baseline method. Across most values of b, LLM SELECTOR attains higher or comparable identification proba- bility relative to the baselines. In contrast, baseline methods exhibit inconsistent performance: for example, Bradley\u2013Terry performs well on AlpacaEval but is not competitive on other datasets, while Confidence per- forms strongly on Bingo but poorly elsewhere. By comparison, LLM SELECTOR demonstrates consistently competitive performance across all benchmarks. 4.4.2 Annotation Efficiency for Near-Best Models Table 1 shows the annotation efficiency of LLM Selector to recover the near-best models on all datasets. We compute annotation efficiency as the relative reduction in the percentage of required annotations compared to the best competing baseline, when selecting a model within \u03b4 vicinity of the best LLM. Specifically, we measure the annotation cost saved by LLM SELECTOR to return a model within 1%, 2.5%, and 5% win rate of the best model. We observe that LLM SELECTOR is highly", "annotations compared to the best competing baseline, when selecting a model within \u03b4 vicinity of the best LLM. Specifically, we measure the annotation cost saved by LLM SELECTOR to return a model within 1%, 2.5%, and 5% win rate of the best model. We observe that LLM SELECTOR is highly annotation efficient, reaching high-performing models faster than best competing baseline. On Arena-Hard and MT-Bench, LLM SELECTOR is able to reach the top 1% and 2.5% vicinity of the best model with relatively few annotations, showing that it can reliably identify near-optimal models with limited annotation effort.

LLM SELECTOR also maintains robustness under \u03b4 = 5%, using up to 58.42% fewer annotations. 4.4.3 Robustness Analysis To analyze the robustness, we compute the win rate gap between the selected and the true best model across all realizations. We then report the 95th percentile of these gaps, capturing the error that is larger than 95% of the observed outcomes. We perform this evaluation with varying annotation budgets, where the budgets are chosen as the amounts required for LLM SELECTOR to reach 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% identification probability. Table 2 shows 95th percentile win rate gap between the chosen and the best LLMs. LLM SELECTOR achieves a smaller accuracy gap when measured against the budget required to reach 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% identification probability across nearly all datasets. The accuracy gap of LLM SELECTOR is either the best among all strategies or, the second best. Our results show that LLM SELECTOR consistently select best or near-best models with high confidence for the majority of time. 5 Discussion We study the novel problem of active model selection for LLMs. We adapt several baselines and introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first strategy tailored to this task. To further reduce supervision, we propose a judge- based oracle annotation scheme. Our experiments show that LLM SELECTOR lowers annotation costs while reliably identifying the best LLM across tasks and datasets. Designed for settings with scarce annotations and evolving data, LLM SELECTOR enables adaptive, cost-efficient, and robust model selection for LLM deployment. 10 References Ebtesam", "propose a judge- based oracle annotation scheme.

Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior re- search has primarily examined explicit relation- ships, but little is known about entity represen- tations themselves. We introduce entity men- tion reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity men- tions can be generated from internal represen- tations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowl- edge. Our proposed method, leveraging task vectors, allows to consistently generate multi- token mentions from various entity represen- tations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the Entity Lens, extending the logit-lens to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs de- velop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, includ- ing those unseen during training.1 1 Introduction Despite the remarkable achievements of LLMs across a range of natural language processing tasks, the mechanisms underlying their ability to repre- sent and manipulate knowledge remain opaque, making it challenging to enhance their interpretabil- ity and control. Among the various components of knowledge expression, entities are fundamental building blocks. They serve as anchors for factual information and relationships within text. A key challenge is therefore to understand how LLMs internally represent named entities (e.g. Eiffel 1Code is available here, including all the hyper-parameters used in the experiments. LLM layers fel tower the \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f 1 Eif been has ... ... Does this representation identify \u2018Eiffel Tower\u2019 ?

Understanding how entity knowledge is stored and retrieved may enable us to better monitor when and why LLMs hallucinate or generate factually inconsistent responses. Current interpretability research has primarily fo- cused on entity relationships and factual knowledge rather than the internal representation of entities themselves (Geva et al., 2021, 2023; Hernandez et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2023). Many named entities span multiple tokens, yet prior work has largely used single-token probing. Our work seeks to fill this gap by exploring how LLMs build unified en- tity representations from multiple token. In this work, we posit that LLMs compute layer- agnostic entity representations that can be isolated and manipulated. Our primary objective is to es- tablish a direct association between these internal representations and named entities, focusing specif- ically on their mention in text. To evaluate this association, we measure how accurately", "this work, we posit that LLMs compute layer- agnostic entity representations that can be isolated and manipulated. Our primary objective is to es- tablish a direct association between these internal representations and named entities, focusing specif- ically on their mention in text. To evaluate this association, we measure how accurately the corre- sponding mention can be generated from the repre- sentation at hand. The core of our methodology is arXiv:2510.09421v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 presented in Section 3.1, addressing the following research question: RQ 1. How well entity mentions can be decoded from their representation? Our results show that LLMs possess specific mechanisms for representing and manipulating en- tities, allowing them to consistently generate men- tions from their internal entity representations. We also find that decoding capacity depends more on an entity frequency in the training data than on its token length. Our next research question challenges the cur- rent assumption of using the last token\u2019s represen- tation at a given layer. We address it in Section 4. RQ 2. Can we find better representations than the last token representations from LLMs? As alternatives, we propose averaging the men- tion token representations and cleaning the entity representation, and show those help the model to decode entity mentions. Our last research question relates to the addi- tional knowledge entity representations capture; it is developed in Section 5: RQ 3. Does the structure of the entity representa- tion space capture (relational) knowledge? By transforming the representation of subject to related object entities with a linear transformation, we show that we can extract more than the sole entity mention from those representations. We also introduce a practical application of our method called the Entity Lens. It allows to visual- ize which entity the model is \u201cthinking\u201d about at a given layer, extending logit lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) to generate multi-token entity mentions, in- stead of projecting a token\u2019s hidden state onto the vocabulary. 2 Related Work The question of knowledge representation has been studied very early in the development of neu- ral network approaches for language modeling. Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) shows that re- lationships between words (e.g., singular to plural, capital to country) could be represented as trans- lations between word representations. This moti- vated the development of knowledge base repre- sentations where entities were linked by geomet- rical transformation \u2013 e.g., TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) that explicitly uses the translation observed in Word2Vec. With the development of contextual word \u2013 and then token \u2013 embeddings, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2019) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the question of how knowledge is encoded and how entities are represented was temporarily put aside. Then, early work (Petroni et al., 2019) showed that pre-trained LLMs can act as \"knowledge bases\" by retrieving factual information through prompt-based queries. To understand how this re- trieval occurs in LLMs, Geva et al. (2021); Meng et al. (2022) hypothesized that feed-forward layers act as key-value memories, storing and retrieving factual associations during inference. Even if this idea has been challenged (Niu et al., 2023), Hernan- dez", "factual information through prompt-based queries. To understand how this re- trieval occurs in LLMs, Geva et al. (2021); Meng et al. (2022) hypothesized that feed-forward layers act as key-value memories, storing and retrieving factual associations during inference. Even if this idea has been challenged (Niu et al., 2023), Hernan- dez et al. (2024) showed that, within LLMs, sim- ple relations can often be approximated by a linear mapping of the subject to the object entity represen- tation at a middle decoder layer \u2013 echoing (Mikolov et al., 2013) in the context of LLMs. This sug- gests that LLMs operate, at least partially, within a structured entity representation space where enti- ties can be manipulated. Recent research employ- ing sparse auto-encoders supports this hypothesis, with Ferrando et al. (2025) identifying a feature within this entity representation space that quanti- fies how much the model \"knows\" about an entity. This raises the question of how entities them- selves are represented. Research suggests that earlier layers capture surface-level details, while deeper layers encode more abstract and task- specific features (Jawahar et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019; Geva et al., 2023). While entities are processed across all layers, their representa- tions\u2014especially for multi-token entities\u2014may not always be coherent or robust. While probing methods are used to determine whether specific types of information (e.g., syntac- tic structure or factual content) can be extracted from the model\u2019s representations (Conneau et al., 2018; Tenney et al., 2019), these probes are not fine-grained and do not allow to understand how knowledge is processed and represented. To gain some insight on how LLM processes knowledge, a specific type of probe, called \u2018logit attribution\u2019 or \u2018logit lens\u2019 has been developed (nostalgebraist, 2020; Yu et al., 2023; Dalvi et al., 2019). With logit lens, the LLM hidden states are projected onto the vocabulary using the unembedding matrix, allow- ing to identify which tokens would be predicted at a given layer of the LLM.

Using the logit lens can help, but is insufficient to properly associate representations with the entire multi-token mention. This issue is further highlighted by (Liu, 2021), who found that tokenization granularity can significantly affect the quality of representations for multi-word expressions. In this contribution, we extend logit lens by proposing the Entity lens that decodes full entity mentions from internal representations. To address these challenges, researchers have explored strategies like attention-based aggregation (Clark et al., 2019), contextual subword pooling (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021), and token-level masking (Joshi et al., 2020). More recent methods such as Patchscopes (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024) and SelfIE (Chen et al., 2024) extends the limitations of the logit lens to produce multi-token explanations from an extracted representation. In contrast with generating general explanations, our work focuses on entity mention, allowing the use of quantitative metrics such as exact match. Our work specifically studies the problem of how to represent and manipulate multi-token entities. 3 Retrieving entity mentions from LLM representations 3.1 Methodology In transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017), text is tokenized into a sequence of tokens (t1, . . . , tn) \u2208Vn, with V the vocabu- lary used by the tokenizer. These tokens are em- bedded into a sequence of initial representations (z0 1, . . . , z0 n) \u2208Rd, with d the model\u2019s representa- tion space dimension. These representations are sequentially passed through the transformer layers: each layer \u2113\u2208{1, . . . , NL} generates a new series of representations (z\u2113 1, . . . , z\u2113 n) \u2208Rd, building on the representations from the preceding layer. Decoding In this contribution, we aim at associ- ating a given representation z \u2208Rd at hand with a named entity by trying to generate the mention from which the representation was extracted. Fol- lowing the literature (Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2023), z\u2113is extracted from the last token of the entity mention at layer \u2113(See Figure 1). Section 4 extends our experiments to other representations. To generate a mention for the representation z\u2113, we insert it bypassing the embedding layer and prompt the model to reconstruct the corresponding entity mention. This is done using a soft prompt or embed- ding vector, \u03b8\u2113\u2208Rd, optimized for the task. This method is known as Prompt Tuning (Lester et al., 2021). Because this vector is functional rather than semantic, we refer to \u03b8\u2113as a task vector, inspired by Hendel et al. (2023). Motivation of using Task Vectors Prompt tun- ing is a parameter-efficient method to prompt the model to perform a variety of tasks (Lester et al., 2021). It is however not the only method that can be used to generate text. Since our focus is on in- terpretability while keeping the LLM unchanged, fine-tuning is excluded. Probes have also been ex- plored in this context (see for instance Pal et al. (2023)), but they do not easily allow to decode an arbitrary-lenght sequences of tokens, nor to prompt the model to retrieve a", "focus is on in- terpretability while keeping the LLM unchanged, fine-tuning is excluded. Probes have also been ex- plored in this context (see for instance Pal et al. (2023)), but they do not easily allow to decode an arbitrary-lenght sequences of tokens, nor to prompt the model to retrieve a mention from a context. To the best of our knowledge, our task vector ap- proach is the only method that can address all these constraints and challenges of entity reconstruction. Our results furthermore show that this method per- forms well for the considered task. Uncontextualized Decoding In this setting, the model\u2019s only input is the representation z\u2113along with the task vector \u03b8\u2113. The goal is to generate the entire entity mention. This allows us to measure how much information about the entity mention is retained in z\u2113. This setting is illustrated Figure 2a. Contextualized Decoding. In contextualized de- coding, we include the textual context from which the representation was extracted before prompting the transformer with the task vector \u03b8\u2113. Figure 2b provides an overview of this methodology. In this setting, the model can just copy the mention from the context. This is however not a trivial task as the model must first identify the correct span within the context, i.e. essentially performing Named Entity Recognition (NER). Evaluation In both settings, our setup allows to generate a complete mention from a given en- tity representation z \u2208Rd. We can then evalu- ate the reconstruction performance using the exact match metric (EM) between generated mentions and the original mentions from which the represen- tations were extracted. Entity mentions are how- ever known to be ambiguous, and a more general problem would consider all possible mentions for a given entity (e.g. NYC or New York City). The metric used in our uncontextual setup only mea- sures the ability to reconstruct the specific mention from which the representation was extracted in the context, without accounting for possible additional ambiguous mentions. Although well posed, the re- sults are therefore only a lower bound for the more general problem. For instance, New York City could be considered as an accurate generation from the representation of the mention NYC; our evalu- ation metric, however, considers it a failure. This limitation does not apply in the contextual setup, where the model is instructed to copy the mention directly from the provided context. Task Vector Training In both settings, for each layer \u2113of the model, the task vector \u03b8\u2113is learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of generating the entity mention, given both the representation and \u03b8\u2113. We use cross-entropy, the standard loss for language modeling tasks. More implementation details and code can be found in the reproducibil- ity statement, in Section A. Training a task vector for each layer allows us to evaluate which layers provide the most accurate entity representations. 3.2 Dataset and Experiment Setup Data Our experiment involves extracting the rep- resentation of an entity mention within its context, and then trying to reconstruct the entity mention from this representation. This requires a dataset containing sentences with labeled spans of", "evaluate which layers provide the most accurate entity representations. 3.2 Dataset and Experiment Setup Data Our experiment involves extracting the rep- resentation of an entity mention within its context, and then trying to reconstruct the entity mention from this representation. This requires a dataset containing sentences with labeled spans of entity mentions: in other words, a NER dataset, for which we ignore the entity categories. We use the CoNLL-2003 dataset (Sang and De Meulder, 2003), a widely used NER benchmark. It provides a diverse set of named entities across various types, lengths and frequencies, making it well-suited for studying entity representations. In the CoNLL- 2003 dataset and using the Pythia tokenizer, most entity mentions are tokenized into 2 or 3 tokens, while some span up to 8-12 tokens (see Figure 3). This diversity in token length allows us to explore the robustness of the models in handling both short and long multi-token entities, a key aspect of this study. More details on the dataset statistics can be found in Section A. 0 5 10 15 0 500 1,000 1,500 Median: 3.0 tokens Number of tokens in entity mention Counts 0 5 10 15 0% 10% 20% 30% Figure 3: Distribution of the number of tokens for named entity mentions in the test set (PYTHIA tok- enizer). 87% of them are tokenized with two or more tokens. The dashed line is the median token count (3). Models We focus on decoder-only architectures, used in the vast majority of recent models, and known for their superior performance. We experi- ment with different models from two families. First, the PYTHIA family (Biderman et al., 2023), which includes several models of various sizes, trained with the same data and close settings. This allows the study of the impact of architecture parameters on performance, especially the model size. We also use the recent PHI family, a set of models trained with the latest techniques and curated data (Li et al., 2023). We use the available non-instruct versions, namely PHI-1.5 (Li et al., 2023) and PHI- 2 (Javaheripi and Bubeck, 2023), allegedly trained on identical text data, with the particularity that knowledge from PHI-1.5 has been distilled into PHI-2. We also use PHI-32 (Abdin et al., 2024), the next iteration of the PHI family which follows the LLAMA-2 architecture, and has the particular- ity of having a significantly smaller vocabulary size (32k tokens compared to 50k tokens for all other models considered in this work) and of being in- struction fine-tuned \u2013 which is the only version available. We utilize models ranging from 140m to 7B parameters, which offers a fair range for studying the impact of model size, while limiting resource consumption. The architecture parameters of all the models we experimented with are detailed in appendix (Table 4). 3.3 Results The results in both settings are presented in Fig- ure 4a (uncontextual decoding) and Figure 4b (con- textual). Without access to any context, some mod- els (PYTHIA-6.9B, PHI-2 and PHI-3) are able to decode exactly the whole mention of up to 65% of the named entities from", "4). 3.3 Results The results in both settings are presented in Fig- ure 4a (uncontextual decoding) and Figure 4b (con- textual). Without access to any context, some mod- els (PYTHIA-6.9B, PHI-2 and PHI-3) are able to decode exactly the whole mention of up to 65% of the named entities from the test set. Upon analysis of the results, we observe that failed samples typi- cally exhibit high semantic similarity with the orig- inal mention (see Table 3 in appendix for examples of failures). Model size unsurprisingly improves performance, supporting a well-known property that larger models memorize more knowledge, in- cluding named entities.3 Figure 4a also shows that representations from the middle layers achieve bet- ter performance in mention decoding, corroborat- ing findings reported in (Meng et al., 2022, 2023). We unsurprisingly achieve significantly better generation results in the contextual setting where the model can copy the mention from the given context (Figure 4b). Near-optimal performance is reached: 93% EM when generating entity men- tions using representations of their last tokens with PHI-2 (layer 20) \u2013 it was only 64% in the uncontex- tual setup. These results reveal a key new insight: LLMs do not, in general, store the entire entity mention within the representation of its last token. This challenges the common assumption that the final token\u2019s representation encapsulates the full en- tity meaning (Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2023), and suggests that alternative encoding approaches may be needed to better capture multi-token entity representations. Unlike sentence embedding models \u2013 which 2more specifically Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. 3Best performance as a function of model size is reported in appendix, Figure 11. have been shown to encode almost all tokens from the input sentence (Morris et al., 2023) \u2013 auto- regressive language models are not trained to en- code tokens explicitly in their internal representa- tions. Instead, if an entity is already mentioned in the context, the model can retrieve it thanks to the attention mechanism and simply copy it, as shown in various mechanistic interpretability stud- ies (Wang et al., 2022; McDougall et al., 2023). Multi-token entities and frequency Decoding the one-token entity France from its embedding or representation at any layer z\u2113is much easier than decoding Mand-el-bro-t from the sole represen- tation of token 't'. To further analyze how the number of tokens affects decoding performance, we split the test set based on tokenized mention length. Then, following the intuition that entity mentions frequent in the LLM training set should be easier to generate than rare ones, we also split the test set into quantiles based on mention n-gram frequency in the Pile (Gao et al., 2020).4 We evalu- ate both settings across all models. In both cases, entity frequency \u2013 and not the number of tokens \u2013 is the main factor for accurate entity mention de- coding (though the two are naturally correlated, see Figure 5 for results on the three PYTHIA models in the uncontextual setting). Baseline - Decoding any sequence We setup a control experiment to confirm that the unveiled mention decoding ability is specific to entities rather than", "for accurate entity mention de- coding (though the two are naturally correlated, see Figure 5 for results on the three PYTHIA models in the uncontextual setting). Baseline - Decoding any sequence We setup a control experiment to confirm that the unveiled mention decoding ability is specific to entities rather than a general capability of LLMs to de- code prior tokens. Using the same methodology as in Section 3, we replace all entity mentions in our original dataset with randomly sampled sequences of three5 tokens from the data, constraining the last token to be the end of a word for fairer com- parison. We then train new task vectors for each model layer, so they instruct the LLM to decode the 3-token sequence from the final-token\u2019s repre- sentation. The results are presented in both set- tings in Figure 4, (control) restricted to the best- performing model (PHI-2) for clarity. In the uncon- textual setup, this baseline reaches only 9% Exact Match (EM), compared to 65% when decoding en- tity mentions, strongly supporting our claim that LLMs detect and represent entities in a specific 4n-gram frequencies are obtained using the API from (Liu et al., 2024). 5Three is the median entity length in our data, see Figure 3.

In the contextual setup, the task seems trivial: The model must only find the extracted to- ken in the context and copy it along with the two preceding tokens. However, results are surprisingly poor, with a maximum 19% EM (layer 9 of Phi-2, compared to 93% EM with 3-token entity mentions in the original contextual experiment). This further supports the idea that, unlike counting tokens, ma- nipulating entity mentions \u2013and potentially other meaningful units", "with the two preceding tokens. However, results are surprisingly poor, with a maximum 19% EM (layer 9 of Phi-2, compared to 93% EM with 3-token entity mentions in the original contextual experiment). This further supports the idea that, unlike counting tokens, ma- nipulating entity mentions \u2013and potentially other meaningful units \u2013 is a natural task for which LLMs develop specialized circuits. Conclusion Overall, our results in Section 3 bring strong evidence that LLMs develop specific mechanisms for representing and manipulating en- tities. In both settings, with only a single learned task vector, we successfully prompt the model to generate the correct entity mention from its rep- resentation. For named entities that are frequent in the LLM training set, the last token represen- tation at middle layers is enough to retrieve their whole mention, just as if the latter was part of the vocabulary (Figure 5). For less common entities, LLMs however do not store the whole mention in its last token representation (even if they could, see the supplementary experiment in Section B.4). Still, when provided with the context, LLMs can very robustly detect and copy them, achieving near optimal performance in our setup (see Figure 4b). These results also demonstrate that representations are layer-agnostic since the LLM is still able to process them when injected at the embedding level, using only a simple task vector. Additional experi- ments investigating how those representations are built are detailed in Section B.3. We also confirm that task vectors generalize across different settings and layers (see Section B.2), further supporting our claim that they activate to a given extent the same specific circuits within LLMs. 4 Obtaining better representations In this section, we question the optimality of us- ing the last token representation of an entity. We extend our initial experiments by using alternative representations for named entity mentions. For ex- periments, we chose to focus on PHI-2, because it is newer compared to PYTHIA, has a reasonable number of parameters allowing fast inference and got the best results in the first set of experiments. Average representations The most common way to extract representations of sentences with language models is to average the representations of all their tokens (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009). As superpositions are the building blocks of LLMs (Elhage et al., 2022), this seems a natural choice. Formally, for a given named entity mention e = (te1, ..., te2), we compute its average representa- tion at layer \u2113over the mention tokens, \u00afz\u2113as \u00afz\u2113= Pe2 i=e1 z\u2113 i e2\u2212e1+1. Training a linear layer to clean the entity Rep- resentations are highly dependent on the context (Ethayarajh, 2019). In other words, for a given en- tity mention, the representations extracted from the inner layers of transformer models are very likely to contain, along with the representation of the entity, a lot of noise that comes from the context. Passing the extracted representation z into a linear layer that would clean or reinforce some relevant features might produce entity representations of better quality, in the sense that the model could bet- ter decode the entity mention", "representation of the entity, a lot of noise that comes from the context. Passing the extracted representation z into a linear layer that would clean or reinforce some relevant features might produce entity representations of better quality, in the sense that the model could bet- ter decode the entity mention from them. For both uncontextual and contextual settings, we therefore train a linear model with parameters (W, b) that is applied to the extracted representation z to obtain a cleaned representation Cz = Wz + b \u2208Rd. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 PHI-2 layer (0 is embedding) Exact Match Contextual, last Contextual, last cleaned Contextual, Avg Contextual, Avg cleaned Uncontextual, last Uncontextual, last cleaned Uncontextual, Avg Uncontextual, Avg cleaned Figure 6: Entity mention generation with different repre- sentations. Representations are extracted as described in Section 3.1(last), by averaging (avg) or cleaning (clean) mention representations, as detailed Section 4. Each experiment was conducted 5 times to get an estimate of the variance. (not clearly visible since it is quite small) Results Overall, we see in Figure 6 that in both uncontextual and contextual setups, the average representation of the tokens from a named entity mention allows to better decode it than the sole rep- resentation of the last token (See Figure 6 compar- ing the red and orange curves). The gain compared to representations of the last token is aligned with the conclusion of our uncontextual mention genera- tion experiment (see Figure 4a), suggesting that the representation of the last token in auto-regressive LLMs does not in general encode all the tokens of the entity mention. In the embedding layer (layer 0 in Figure 6) rep- resentations \u00afz0 are just the average of embeddings. For uncontextual decoding, performance jumps to 51% compared to the 33% of exact matches ob- tained when generating only from the last token\u2019s embedding (solid red and orange curves) \u2013 this holds to a lesser extent for contextual decoding too. If the model can disentangle all the tokens from their superposed representation in \u00afz0, it still has to figure out their order to retrieve the original men- tion.6 Upper layers representations may therefore encode a notion of relative token position. The fact that last token representations from middle layers yield better results than the average of the token embeddings (up to 64% vs 51%) however shows that there is more than only token superposition in the representation of an entity mention. Transforming the representation with a linear model before inserting it at the embedding layer also improves the reconstruction performance in both settings (Green and blue curves in Figure 6). The generation performance gain means that re- moving or boosting some relevant features \u2013 prob- ably associated with non-entity representation sub- spaces, common to all entity representation, helps the model in generating the correct entity mention. Overall, this demonstrates that using the sole last token representation at a given layer may not be the best choice to represent an entity. Further work is needed though to understand precisely", "non-entity representation sub- spaces, common to all entity representation, helps the model in generating the correct entity mention.

Averaging or cleaning the representations degrades the semantic information of raw representa- tions from the last token of the entity mention. We reproduce the idea from Hernandez et al. (2024) that for some basic relations, the association between zs and zo can be approximated by a linear model. Our work extends those results by properly accounting for multi-token entities. We train a linear model L : zs 7\u2192Wzs + b that aims to project the subject representation zs on the object representation zo, i.e. L(zs) \u2248zo. Experimental settings We use datasets from Hernandez et al. (2024) for which there are enough samples to train our linear model. Following their methodology, The data is filtered to keep only sam- ples for which the relation is encoded in the model\u2019s parametric memory, guaranteeing that the object entity is represented somewhere. We then optimize our linear model parameters (W, b) using mean- square error on 50 training samples with stochas- tic gradient descent. We perform this procedure for each layer \u2113, using all studied representations (z\u2113,\u00afz\u2113, Cz\u2113or C\u00afz\u2113) for subject and object entities, allowing to identify which representations carry the most semantic information about an entity. Results Our mention generation method (See Section 3.1) allows the generation of a mention for the obtained representation and then use ex- act match as a metric instead of only comparing the first token only as in (Hernandez et al., 2024; Geva et al., 2023). In practice, we present the re- sults using the Character F-score (Chr-F), which is not binary and thus produces smoother plots. Fig- ure 7 shows that, training a linear model on only 50 samples leads to over 72% Chr-F (74% EM) on the Landmarks_to_country test set. We show the application to other relation datasets with sim- ilar results in appendix (Figure 14).

Moreover, if using average or cleaned representations yields bet- ter performance on mention decoding, this seems to be at the price of losing semantic information, particularly when it comes to encoding relations to other entities \u2013 as shown by the fact that averaging or cleaning representations degrades the results. Entity Lens Thanks to our task vectors, we can generate a mention from representations of any to- ken in a text. This allows visualizing which entity the model is \u201cthinking\u201d about when processing a token. We name this method the Entity Lens, gen- eralizing the logit lens (nostalgebraist, 2020), that associates multi-token mentions with any given representation, using the learned task vectors from Section 3. For instance, applying the Entity Lens to the sentence \u201cThe City of Lights iconic landmark\u201d shows that the model associates the mention \u201cCity of Lights\u201d with Paris, and re- trieves a representation associated with \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d while processing the token \u201clandmark\u201d. Figure 8 shows entities decoded from various hid- den representations from PHI-2. 6 Conclusion In this study, we have demonstrated that LLMs develop specialized mechanisms for representing and manipulating entities. Our experiments show that they can effectively be prompted using trained task vectors to generate complete mentions from entity representations. When given context, they reliably detect and copy mentions of entities, in- cluding those outside their parametric memory. Ad- ditionally, we showed that these representations can be semantically manipulated to decode basic relations, extending previous work. A direct appli- cation of our methodology, the Entity Lens, allows for instance to visualize which entity the model is \u201cthinking\u201d about at a given layer. Overall, our results support the existence of an entity representation space within LLMs. This un- derstanding paves the way for further research into how LLMs handle and manipulate knowledge, po- tentially leading to more explainable and control- lable language models.

Additional examples can be found in Section D.1. 7 Limitations Generalization of Task Vectors Our method also assumes that the representations are layer- agnostic, meaning the LLM operates within a single representation space. More importantly, we assume that the task vector -the only learned parameters- is sufficient to instruct the LLM to decode the entity mention without providing any further information. This discrepancy between contextual and uncon- textual settings is reflected by the fact that learned task vectors are not the same across layers (see Fig- ure 13 in appendix), although we see that they tend to generalize well to other layers (see in appendix, Figure 15). This design choice was motivated by the known performance of prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021), which successfully trains embedding vectors to prompt the model into performing spe- cific tasks. Entity Lens Our experiments with task vectors, trained specifically on entities, extend the logit lens by enabling multi-token generation of entity mentions from any representation within the trans- former. While our current implementation serves as a preliminary demonstration of this capability, further research is needed to fully explore its po- tential. Currently, our approach generates only a single mention, whereas the traditional logit lens can re- trieve the top-k mappings. This limitation could be addressed by employing beam-search genera- tion, which would allow us to generate the \"top-k\" entity mentions for a given representation, thereby enhancing the versatility and applicability of our method. Additionally, the task vectors we train are layer-specific, whereas a more practical implemen- tation would leverage one generalist task vector, which we leave for future work. 8 Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge the ANR \u2013 FRANCE (French National Research Agency) for its finan- cial support of the GUIDANCE project n\u00b0ANR- 23-IAS1-0003 as well as the Chaire Multi- Modal/LLM ANR Cluster IA ANR-23-IACL- 0007.

B.3 Analyzing entity representations Here, we explore how entity mention representa- tions are built inside an LLM. Successive representations We explore the con- vergence of the successive representations to the one that we extract at layer \u2113. We consider the co- sine similarity of the entity representation z\u2113with the output from different layers, including Multi- head self-attention (Attn) and Multi-Layer Percep- tron (MLP) sublayers. Sublayers iteratively add or remove information in the residual stream. There is no predominant layer for the construction of z\u2113 (See Figure 10). Causal analysis is an alternative mean to assess the contribution of one component of a transformer layer on the representation construction. We use emb1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Cosine similarity SubLayers Embed", "a transformer layer on the representation construction.

The observed behavior is representative of the general one. sublayer knockout, as done in (Geva et al., 2023), by zeroing out the output of one MLP or attention block of a given layer \u2113while computing the repre- sentation z\u2113. We can measure how much this block contributes to this representation by comparing the similarity of the obtained representation with the original one. We observe that, apart from the first layer, no other blocks have a causal effect on the final representation z\u2113, confirming the observation made above. Conclusion Both our similarity and causal analy- sis experiments lead us to conclude that, as pre- vious work also suggested (Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2023), there is no clear location where the representation of an entity is \u201ccompleted\u201d. The construction of entity representations are a a smooth, iterative, and massively superposed pro- cess. This aligns with recent contributions on su- perposition and feature disentanglement, and may be explained by the use of dropout during LLM pre- training, nudging the model to develop redundant circuits (Elhage et al., 2022; Bricken et al., 2023). B.4 Training Representations We explore in this section what features in the rep- resentation are really used to generate a mention. To obtain the minimum information required to retrieve the mention, we optimize blank noise to make the model retrieve the right mention when prompted with a task vector trained in the context of our uncontextual mention generation experiment. By doing it several times and averaging the ob- tained vectors, we hope to keep only hat is needed to regenerate the mention. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to train a vector to encode almost any mentions, within reasonable token limits. This confirms that the transformer\u2019s latent space has the capacity to store numerous tokens. LLMs however typically do not utilize this capability when they can access the context, as they can simply copy and paste the appropriate tokens from it.

Our experi- ments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Fur- thermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization. Index Terms\u2014 Speech-LLM, SpokenDST, Multimodal, Con- text Propagation 1. INTRODUCTION Dialog State Tracking (DST) is a vital component in task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems [1, 2], enabling them to understand and main- tain the context of a conversation over multiple turns. By accu- rately tracking user intents and relevant information, DST allows systems to reason over dialog states and effectively fulfill user re- quests. However, in the context of spoken dialog, Spoken DST re- mains a relatively immature research area, with current system per- formance significantly lagging behind those achieved in written dia- log scenarios [3]. One of the most common recent approaches is the cascade system. It typically involves an Automatic Speech Recogni- tion (ASR) module followed by an eventual ASR correction module and then a written DST component [4], often based on models such as T5 [5]. This pipeline approach leverages the strengths of exist- ing text-based DST models and was notably popular in the DSTC11 challenge [6], where it was used by the winning system, OLISIA [7]. Despite its success, the cascade approach faces inherent limita- tions, as it is highly susceptible to error propagation from the ASR stage, which can degrade the overall accuracy of the system [8]. This issue is even more pronounced in real-world scenarios, where ASR systems often struggle with proper nouns and domain-specific termi- nology, elements that are very frequent in DST slot values [9]. End-to-end (E2E) systems have emerged as a promising alter- native, as they may potentially mitigate the error propagation inher- ent in cascade systems. In particular, [10] demonstrated the effec- tiveness of E2E approaches, particularly in fully spoken contexts without access to ground-truth transcriptions, such as the Spoken- WOZ [3] dataset. In these settings, E2E models have been shown to outperform traditional cascade systems. Concurrently, speech-aware \u2217The author performed the work while at an internship large language models (LLMs), which are also considered end-to- end (E2E) systems, have gained increasing popularity in a variety of spoken language tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and response generation [11, 12]. Recent work [13] applied speech-aware LLMs to the spoken DST task, achieving state-of-the- art performance in the SpokenWOZ dataset. A notable advantage of E2E systems is their flexibility in con- text management, as they can seamlessly integrate written and spo- ken information. For instance, [10] and", "response generation [11, 12]. Recent work [13] applied speech-aware LLMs to the spoken DST task, achieving state-of-the- art performance in the SpokenWOZ dataset. A notable advantage of E2E systems is their flexibility in con- text management, as they can seamlessly integrate written and spo- ken information. For instance, [10] and [13] both utilize the spoken representation of the user\u2019s last turn, but differ in how they handle the rest of the context: the former combines the spoken user turn with the written previous state, while the latter combines it with the written representations of all previous turns. This raises an important question. What would happen if we relied solely on spoken context, either by feeding the system the speech representations for the entire conversation or by condensing them using an intermediate module? In this paper, we explore these possibilities for context man- agement when using a Speech-LLM model. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) we validate the use of Speech-LLMs as an accurate approach for spoken DST (b) we propose two context management approaches reaching the SOTA and (c) our best performing approach demonstrates a simple yet effective method: feeding the entire spo- ken conversation to the model without additional compression or modality mixing. 2. METHODOLOGY In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, the role of Spoken Dia- log State Tracking (DST) is to condense the user\u2019s intent and rele- vant information into a structured, machine-readable format. More formally, given as input a sequence of spoken dialogue turns U1, A2, ..., At\u22121, Ut\u22121, our goal is to predict a set of k relevant do- mains (domain1, domain2, ..., domaink) and n slot-value pairs (slot1 = value1, slot2 = value2, ..., slotn = valuen), which are then represented as a JSON structure. The Figure 1 illustrates our proposed systems, composed of three main components: a speech encoder, a connector, and a Large Language Model (LLM). In order to reduce the context length, we optionally add a \u201dcompression module\u201d between the connector and LLM. The speech encoder processes the entire dialog history and computes dense representations for each turn. These representations are then down-sampled, using x6 stride, and passed to the connec- tor module, which maps the speech features into the LLM\u2019s input space. They may be passed through the compression module for the approaches that need it. Finally, the LLM generates the dialogue state in an auto-regressive manner. arXiv:2510.09424v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 2.1. Context Management As represented in Figure 1, we explore several strategies for handling the dialog context. Multimodal Context Following [13], we provide as input the spo- ken user utterance U spoken n and the written dialogue history together. The model then predicts the transcription of the user\u2019s utterance U text n , the active domains Dn and the dialogue state Sn. The LLM is trained on the prompt: hn { \u201dhistory\u201d: Contextn , \u201duser last turn\u201d: U text n , \u201ddo- mains\u201d: Dn , \u201dpredicted state\u201d: Sn } where we have: Contextn = USER: U1 ; AGENT: A2 ; . . . ; AGENT: An\u22121 hn = Connector \u0000Encoder(Un) \u0001 In practice,", "LLM is trained on the prompt: hn { \u201dhistory\u201d: Contextn , \u201duser last turn\u201d: U text n , \u201ddo- mains\u201d: Dn , \u201dpredicted state\u201d: Sn } where we have: Contextn = USER: U1 ; AGENT: A2 ; . . . ; AGENT: An\u22121 hn = Connector \u0000Encoder(Un) \u0001 In practice, the speech representation hn is concatenated with em- beddings that represent the prompt\u2019s text, yielding a multimodal in- put sequence. During inference, the model autoregressively com- pletes the prompt starting from the field \"user last turn\". The generated ASR hypothesis U text n is then fed back to construct the textual context Contextn+1 for subsequent turns. Full Spoken Context With this context-management strategy, Contextn, corresponding to the full spoken conversation, is provided to the model. The model predicts the active domain Dn and the dialogue state Sn. The prompt employed for this strategy is: Speech Emb {\u201ddomains\u201d: Dn ,\u201dpredicted state\u201d: Sn } where : Contextn = (U spoken 1 , Aspoken 2 , . . . , U spoken n ) h2i+1 = Connector \u0000Encoder(U2i+1) \u0001 h2i = Connector \u0000Encoder(A2i) \u0001 Speech Emb = (h1||h2|| . . . ||hn) As in the multimodal context setting, the sequence of speech em- beddings Speech Emb is pre-pended to the embeddings of the tex- tual part of the prompt before being fed to the LLM. During infer- ence, the model receives the speech embeddings as input and auto- regressively generates the remaining fields of the prompt. Compressed Spoken Context The only difference with full spo- ken context is how Speech Emb is obtained. Instead of using the entire sequences hi, we introduce a set of Nqueries trainable query vectors Q and compute zi through query-based pooling using a TransformerDecoder architecture: zi = TransformerDecoder(Q, hi) Speech Emb = (z1||z2|| . . . ||hn) In this formulation, the decoder treats Q as the target sequence and zi as the memory. Each decoder layer first applies self-attention over the query tokens, allowing them to interact and share information. It then applies cross-attention, where the queries attend to the speech sequence zi, extracting the most relevant aspects from it. The final output is a set of Nqueries vectors that serve as a compressed repre- sentation of the turn. These vectors are concatenated and used in downstream dialogue modeling.

To the right finetuning for dialog state tracking 2.2. Training We train our models in two stages, as described in Figure 1. The first stage is ASR pre-training, where we freeze the LLM and train the speech encoder and connector to produce speech representations that align with the LLM\u2019s input space. Specifically, we task the LLM with generating the transcription from the speech embeddings, prop- agating the LLM gradients back to the encoder and connector. This approach allows us to leverage the large-scale ASR datasets that are publicly available, resulting in robust alignment between the speech and text modalities. The second stage is DST fine-tuning. In this phase, we freeze the speech encoder and train the connector, the optional compres- sion module, and a small LoRA module for the LLM. The objective is to produce a JSON string in the format described in 2.1. Train- ing is performed by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the generated output and the ground-truth dialog state annotations. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Datasets For the ASR pre-training stage, we train our model on a combination of the Loquacious Medium dataset (2,500 hours) [14], the Fisher cor- pus (1,960 hours) [15], and the train split from SpokenWOZ dataset (200 hours) [3]. Although SpokenWOZ does not provide ground- truth transcripts, we include it in the ASR pre-training phase because the speech encoder is frozen during DST fine-tuning, and we want the encoder to be exposed to the characteristics of SpokenWOZ data. To address the lack of transcripts on SpokenWOZ, we use Whisper- large-v31 [16] to generate automatic transcriptions for SpokenWOZ audio. These generated transcripts are also used later for the multi- modal context method in the DST stage. For DST fine-tuning, we primarily use the SpokenWOZ dataset for both training and evaluation. As in [10, 13] we remove the nine corrupted dialogues from the SpokenWOZ test set2, and report the Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA) [17] on both the dev and test sets. 1https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3 2https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/issues/87 3.2. Implementation details For our component selection, we use W2v-BERT 3 [18] as the speech encoder. The connector module is implemented as a single-layer Transformer encoder with a hidden dimension of 1024 and 16 atten- tion heads. Similarly, we employ a one-layer Transformer Decoder with a hidden dimension of 1024, 16 heads, and a trainable num- ber of queries (Nqueries) as the compression module. This module is also used for attention pooling by setting Nqueries = 1. For the language model, we use OLMo 2 1B4 [19]. We apply a LoRA adapter with a rank of 16 and an alpha value of 1, as determined by grid search. During inference, we employ beam search with 5 beams, which was also selected based on grid search results. Dur- ing ASR pre-training, we use a virtual batch size of 256, a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22124, and 5,000 warm-up steps.

Best Model Analysis For fair comparison with prior work, the reported JGA for our model in Table 1 uses post-processing, which includes (i) canoni- calizing time expressions to 24-hour format and (ii) case-insensitive fuzzy matching for open/proper-noun slots with a Levenshtein ra- tio \u22650.90, applied symmetrically to predictions and references. Table 1 presents a comparison between published results on the SpokenWOZ test set and our two best systems: the compressed con- text method using 10 queries and the full spoken context method. For our systems the post-processing yields a 3 points JGA increase, which is comparable to the post-processing reported in [13]. Our approach substantially outperforms other systems of comparable size. To the best of our knowledge, the only system that surpasses our results is the Gemma-2-9B variant reported in [13]. We did not opt to train a Gemma-based variant of our model due to its high computational requirements, as our primary objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on small and compact models. Furthermore, as shown in Section 3.4, when using the same model components, our context management strategy significantly outperforms that of previous work. To further analyze our best model, we selected the six slots with the highest error counts.

Most predictions achieve high fuzzy ratios (above 0.8), suggesting that when the model predicts a slot present in the reference, it usually gets the value nearly correct.

This indicates that the model is generally able to correctly predict these proper nouns when it attempts them. In contrast, profile- related slots (e.g., profile-name, profile-idnumber) re- main highly challenging due to their variable content and frequent spelling across multiple turns. Finally, although the error rate for train-leaveat is relatively low compared to its total occur- rences, its high frequency means it still contributes substantially to the overall error count.

In particular, the full spoken context approach achieved a significantly higher JGA, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the entire spoken con- versation as input. The competitive performance of the 10-queries method further suggests that a substantial portion of the speech representations is redundant, and that it is possible to reduce the input size without a significant loss in performance, provided that a sufficient number of queries is used. We next provide a fine-grained comparison based on slot group and dialogue turn analyses. Slot Group Analysis We categorize slots into four groups: cate- gorical, time, open, and profile. Categorical slots have a fixed set of values (e.g., yes/no, area, price range). Time slots correspond to temporal expressions (e.g., departure time). Open slots can take a wide range of values such as place names, while profile slots, which are treated separately for finer analysis, contain personal information (e.g., names, IDs,", "slots have a fixed set of values (e.g., yes/no, area, price range). Time slots correspond to temporal expressions (e.g., departure time). Open slots can take a wide range of values such as place names, while profile slots, which are treated separately for finer analysis, contain personal information (e.g., names, IDs, emails) and are often spelled out across multiple turns. Figure 3a shows the average F1 score by slot type. All models perform well on categorical slots, with full spoken context slightly ahead. Performance drops for time and open slots, where full spo- ken context and 10-query compression clearly outperform the others. Profile slots are the hardest: full spoken context again leads, while the 1-query model performs worst, indicating that compressing each turn to a single embedding discards too much information. Dialogue Turn Analysis Figure 3b displays the evolution of Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA) across dialogue turns. All models perform well in the early turns (1\u20135), but accuracy declines quickly in the mid turns (5\u201330) and approaches zero by turn 40. This drop can be attributed to the increasing length and complexity of dialogue states, combined with the strictness of the JGA metric, as well as the lim- ited capacity of the relatively small LLM used in our experiments. The full spoken context method consistently outperforms the others, particularly during the mid turns. In the very late turns, it shows occasional performance peaks, though these are difficult to interpret given the small sample size. The 10-query attention pooling method remains competitive, but still underperforms compared to full spo- ken context in the late turns, even though it benefits from a much smaller context size. 3.5. Additional Experiences and Discussion Additional Experiences To further understand the contributions of individual components and design choices in our system, we conducted a series of ablation studies and supplementary experi- ments. Specifically, we investigated the impact of ASR pretraining data, the connector, the compression module, and DST data prepro- cessing. For ASR pretraining, we compared using the LibriSpeech dataset [22] alone versus the mixed dataset described in Section 3.1. In baseline experiments with the multimodal method, we observed that when the encoder is unfrozen during DST finetuning, the choice of ASR pretraining data has little impact. However, when freezing the encoder (which is a more practical setup for the Full/Compressed Spoken Context methods), we found that relying solely on Lib- riSpeech resulted in up to a 3-point drop in JGA compared to using the mixed dataset. During ASR pretraining, we also experimented with different numbers of layers (1, 2, and 4) in the encoder. We found that a single layer provided the fastest convergence and the best performance. For the compression module, we varied the num- ber of layers and found that increasing to three layers led to a 2% absolute drop in JGA. We attribute this to the limited amount of DST finetuning data, as the compression module is only initialized at this stage. Finally, for the multimodal context method, we normal- ized Whisper transcripts using NeMo Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) [23], along with additional processing for", "a 2% absolute drop in JGA. We attribute this to the limited amount of DST finetuning data, as the compression module is only initialized at this stage. Finally, for the multimodal context method, we normal- ized Whisper transcripts using NeMo Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) [23], along with additional processing for time expressions. This preprocessing yielded a 1% absolute gain in JGA. Limitations and discussion While our full spoken context ap- proach achieves the highest performance, it could become com- putationally demanding for very long dialogues. The compressed context method offers a good compromise, with strong results and reduced input size. Additionally, we did not scale our experiments to larger LLMs such as Gemma-2-9B. Both directions will be explored in future work. 4. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have proposed a fully E2E approach to Spoken Dialog State Tracking, drawing inspiration from Speech-LLMs. In contrast to traditional multimodal context approaches, we show that it is possible to use the entire spoken conversation as input (until the current turn) and achieve state-of-the-art results. We also have per- formed a fine-grained analysis to illustrate the causes of improve- ments brought by using a full spoken context: less error propagation through the dialog and better performance on the most challenging slots. In future work, a more sophisticated and compact handling of the spoken context may be explored. Moreover, scaling the used model would be a promising extension. 5.

We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean\u2013English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance com- parable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experi- ments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data\u2013driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future mul- tilingual LLM research. All model checkpoints, datasets, and source codes are publicly available at huggingface.co/kormo-lm. 1 Introduction Open-source large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated performance and utility approaching that of proprietary models, which has led to their rapid adoption in both academia and industry [Grattafiori et al., 2024, Team, 2025a, DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a]. However, a significant number of these are open-weight model (OWM), where only the final parameters are released, while critical components of the training recipe, such as data, preprocessing methods, code, hyperparameters, and training logs, often remain undisclosed. This limited scope of disclosure weakens the chain of custody necessary for reproducibility, fair comparison, and responsible deployment, ultimately hindering the scalability of subsequent research. In response, fully open models (FOMs), which transparently release the entire training pipeline, have emerged as a compelling alternative. The efficacy of the FOM approach was shown by OLMo et al. [2025], Muennighoff et al. [2024], who revealed their full methodology, including data sources, cleaning protocols, training scripts, hyperparameters, logs, and model checkpoints. While Workshop et al. [2023] stands as a prominent multilingual example, the trend towards full disclosure has also extended to explorations of compact, long-context, and reasoning-focused models [Bakouch et al., \u2217marks core contributors. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2510.09426v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 2025a]. This trend has significant academic and societal impacts by enabling reproducible research and fostering an ecosystem for derivative models. Despite these advancements, FOM development remains predominantly focused on English. In non-English settings, creating an FOM is made more difficult by several challenges: (i) a lack of large- scale web-crawled corpora, further complicated by copyright and licensing issues; (ii) the significant cost of data curation, including quality refinement, deduplication, and contamination control; and (iii) the ambiguities related to tokenizer architecture and language composition design.", "an FOM is made more difficult by several challenges: (i) a lack of large- scale web-crawled corpora, further complicated by copyright and licensing issues; (ii) the significant cost of data curation, including quality refinement, deduplication, and contamination control; and (iii) the ambiguities related to tokenizer architecture and language composition design. Nevertheless, it has been observed that releasing a foundational FOM for a specific language dramatically lowers research barriers and accelerates ecosystem development [Workshop et al., 2023, OLMo et al., 2025]. Therefore, demonstrating the successful implementation of a first non-English FOM is a task of profound academic and practical significance. More recently, the use of synthetic and augmented data has emerged as a prominent method for addressing this disparity. Research by Gunasekar et al. [2023], Li et al. [2023] has demonstrated that textbook-style synthetic data contributes to enhanced efficiency in small- to medium-scale models. At the same time, large-scale synthesis pipelines are also being deployed in industrial applications [Nvidia et al., 2024]. Simultaneously, the data ecosystem is undergoing rapid enhancement through the public release of refined web corpora suitable for extensive, long-term pre-training [Soldaini et al., 2024, Su et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2025a, Penedo et al., 2024]. The application of synthetic data is prevalent not only in pre-training but also during the SFT and RLHF phases [Wang et al., 2023, Ouyang et al., 2022, Rafailov et al., 2023, Hong et al., 2024, Ethayarajh et al., 2024, Shao et al., 2024], with prompt engineering and data curricula being critical factors for model stability. However, the risk of model collapse due to the self-consuming nature of synthetic data has been a persistent concern [Shumailov et al., 2023a, Alemohammad et al., 2023]. Consequently, before synthetic data can be leveraged as a primary resource in non-English domains, rigorous quantitative validation of its stability and potential biases is imperative. The design of the tokenizer and the language mixture ratio are also critical factors that determine the success or failure of a non-English FOM. The subword tokenization scheme (e.g., BPE, Unigram, byte- level), vocabulary size, and the proportion of each language directly impact compression efficiency, training cost, and downstream generalization [Sennrich et al., 2016, Kudo and Richardson, 2018, Radford et al., 2019, Chai et al., 2024]. This consideration is especially critical for non-Latin script and morphologically rich languages, where surface-form unit selection and vocabulary boundaries can operate differently. Therefore, in the context of an FOM, these aspects must be explicitly explored during the initial design phase. We conduct a systematic investigation into the feasibility and limitations of constructing a synthetic data-driven FOM for Korean. We developed a Korean-English bilingual model from scratch, wherein synthetic data comprises 68.73% of the Korean corpus. We curated a training curriculum totaling 150 billion tokens. This curriculum was applied across all major stages of the training pipeline: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference learning. To achieve a varied distribution of styles and topics, the synthetic data was produced using a combination of Qwen and models from open-source families (e.g., GPT-OSS). This framework serves as the foundation for addressing the following research questions:", "stages of the training pipeline: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference learning. To achieve a varied distribution of styles and topics, the synthetic data was produced using a combination of Qwen and models from open-source families (e.g., GPT-OSS). This framework serves as the foundation for addressing the following research questions: 1. RQ1. Stability: Does synthetic data introduce long-term adverse effects on core components such as normalization, attention, and stabilization techniques? [Shumailov et al., 2023a, Alemohammad et al., 2023] 2. RQ2. Tokenizer: When using a high proportion of synthetic data, what is the optimal config- uration of tokenizer, vocabulary size, and language mixture ratio for balancing compression efficiency against generalization? [Sennrich et al., 2016, Kudo and Richardson, 2018, Chai et al., 2024] 3. RQ3. Bias: When generating synthetic data, are the linguistic and cultural biases of the source model transferred to the new data, damaging or erasing the subtle nuances of the target language? [Wang et al., 2023, Ouyang et al., 2022] Our research design consists of two stages. First, in a cost-effective proxy setting (1B model, 60B tokens), we directly compare a 100% synthetic data condition with a 100% non-synthetic condition. In this stage, we cross-analyze stabilization techniques such as RMSNorm/Pre-LN and curricula for learning rate, batch size, and sequence length, along with different tokenizers and language mixture 2 ratios. Once stability and efficiency are confirmed, then we proceed to build and release a 10.8B-scale Korean\u2013English fully open model. We adhere to FOM principles by disclosing the entire pipeline, including data sources, filtering rules, scripts, hyperparameters, logs, and checkpoints [OLMo et al., 2025, Workshop et al., 2023]. The evaluation covers a wide range of standard benchmarks in knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, common sense, and mathematics (e.g., MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2020b], MMLU-Pro [Wang et al., 2024b], ARC [Clark et al., 2018b], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019a], etc.). This paper presents the following contributions: (1) We are the first to systematically demonstrate that it is feasible to build an FOM in a non-English language, even with a majority proportion of synthetic data. (2) We examine how various tokenizer settings, language mixture ratios, and training curricula affect the trade-offs between stability, efficiency, and generalization, offering practical guidelines based on our results. and (3) By releasing a 10.8B parameter Korean-English fully-open model, including data, code, recipes, and logs, we significantly improve the reproducibility and accessibility of multilingual FOM research. 2 Exploring Training Design Choices The training process of a large language model (LLM) involves numerous design decisions, spanning from the model architecture and scale (e.g., depth, width, number of layers), to hyperparameter settings like learning rate and its schedule, and strategies for the composition and preprocessing of training data. Previous research has reported the effectiveness of an approach where various configurations are first explored using smaller-scale proxy models, with the final model\u2019s architecture then being determined based on these initial results [Kaplan et al., 2020, Hoffmann et al., 2022]. This approach has proven to be a practical strategy for balancing cost-effectiveness with exploration speed. More recently, scaling priorities from a compute-optimal perspective are also being", "smaller-scale proxy models, with the final model\u2019s architecture then being determined based on these initial results [Kaplan et al., 2020, Hoffmann et al., 2022]. This approach has proven to be a practical strategy for balancing cost-effectiveness with exploration speed. More recently, scaling priorities from a compute-optimal perspective are also being refined [Hoffmann et al., 2022]. While our study also follows this approach, we give special consideration to a scenario focused on the use of augmented (synthetic) data. Given that we use large-scale synthetic data as a primary resource, it is necessary to quantitatively verify the potential risks that this data might pose to model training, such as performance degradation from self-consuming loops [Shumailov et al., 2023a, Alemohammad et al., 2023]. We therefore trained a 1B-scale proxy model on 60B tokens to investigate two questions: (1) What are the performance differences between a model trained solely on synthetic data versus one trained on non-synthetic data? (2) Does synthetic data have a negative impact on training stability (e.g., the frequency of loss spikes)? Through this analysis, we experimentally validated the effectiveness and stability of a synthetic data-driven training approach. In addition, we systematically evaluated core design factors in the tokenizer training process, including the composition of the data mixture, the tokenization compression ratio, and the influence of synthetic data on the overall distribution. The choice of tokenizer (BPE/Unigram/byte-level), vocabulary size, and language mixture ratio have been emphasized in numerous studies as factors that govern training efficiency and generalization performance. These are critical design considerations that must be examined, especially when compensating for data scarcity with synthetic data in non-English contexts. We conducted a series of exploratory experiments as specified in Table 1. The synthesis of these results guided the final design of the KORMo(10.8B) model. The final design incorporates Pre-LN[Xiong et al., 2020] and RMSNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019] for stable training; Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) [Ainslie et al., 2023] and Multi-Query Attention (MQA) [Shazeer, 2019] for inference efficiency; as well as SwiGLU activation [Shazeer, 2020] and RoPE positional embeddings [Su et al., 2024b]. Additionally, we utilized a document packing technique for large-scale corpus training, which efficiently fills sequences to their maximum length to reduce training waste [Chowdhery et al., 2023, Grattafiori et al., 2024]. This series of decisions provides practical design guidelines for building reproducible and open large-scale language models for non-English languages from scratch. 2.1 Experiment Settings To explore the design choices for model architecture and training methods, a baseline training corpus, evaluation benchmarks, a proxy model, and a default training configuration are necessary.

Given the ongoing debate about the emergent abilities reported in large-scale models [Wei et al., 2022, Schaeffer et al., 2023], we interpret the performance trends observed at the proxy stage with a focus on relative comparison. 1. Language: In the proxy stage, to ensure rich benchmark resources and experimental re- liability, we limited our scope to English data to compare synthetic versus non-synthetic setups. 2. Train Corpus: For non-synthetic data, we used 60B tokens randomly sampled from Ultra- FineWeb, which has undergone multi-dimensional filtering [Wang et al., 2025a, Penedo et al., 2024]. During training, document packing was applied to match the maximum sequence length, thereby minimizing data waste [Chowdhery et al., 2023]. For the synthetic data experiments, we used 60B tokens from the high-quality synthetic split of Nemotron-CC [Su et al., 2025]. (While a broader comparison of various synthetic sources would be ideal, there were constraints in terms of data construction and training costs.) 3. Evaluation Suite: For the proxy model evaluation, we used MCQA benchmarks with balanced answer distributions and varied difficulty levels. General language understanding and reading comprehension were assessed with RACE [Lai et al., 2017], BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019a], and TruthfulQA (TFQA) [Lin et al., 2022]. Science and reasoning were evaluated with ARC-Easy (ARC-E) [Clark et al., 2018b] and OpenBookQA (OBQA) [Mihaylov et al., 2018]. Commonsense reasoning was evaluated using HellaSwag (HSWG) [Zellers et al., 2019a], Winogrande (WGRD) [Sakaguchi et al., 2021b], and PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020b]. For consistent comparison, a default 5-shot setting was used, but due to the nature of the task, TFQA was evaluated in a 0-shot setting (to prevent the model from fabricating confident answers). 4. Model Architecture: The base structure followed the Llama-3 series architecture, which includes Pre-LN, GQA [Ainslie et al., 2023], SwiGLU [Shazeer, 2020], and RoPE [Su et al., 2024b] [Grattafiori et al., 2024]. 5. Tokenizer: Since the proxy experiments were conducted solely on English data, we used the well-established BPE-based tokenizer from Llama-3 [Grattafiori et al., 2024]. In Chapter 3, a tokenizer trained on English-Korean bilingual data is evaluated separately to reflect the actual target environment. 4 2.2 Normalization Methods Normalization plays a key role in both training stability and performance improvement, and it is broadly categorized into post-LN and Pre-LN depending on its placement. Xiong et al. [2020] theoretically and empirically analyzed the differences in initialization and gradient behavior between the two methods, showing that Pre-LN converges more stably in large-scale pre-training. Additionally, RMSNorm was proposed as an alternative to reduce the computational cost of LayerNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019], and stabilization techniques for very deep transformers (hundreds to thousands of layers), such as DeepNorm, have also been reported [Wang et al., 2024a]. More recently, hybrid approaches", "more stably in large-scale pre-training. Additionally, RMSNorm was proposed as an alternative to reduce the computational cost of LayerNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019], and stabilization techniques for very deep transformers (hundreds to thousands of layers), such as DeepNorm, have also been reported [Wang et al., 2024a]. More recently, hybrid approaches (such as MixLN) that mix different normalization methods in the initial and later layers have been discussed in this context, aiming to mitigate the gradient vanishing problem in very deep networks. In this study, we hypothesized that the choice of normalization is directly related to RQ1: Does augmented data negatively affect training stability? This is because if augmented data exacerbates instability under a specific normalization method, it could become a critical risk factor in large-scale training.

Pre-LN consistently outperforms MixLN, and the use of synthetic data introduces no performance degradation. In the experiment, MixLN was configured by applying Post-LN to the first two layers, which constitute 12.5% of the total layers, and Pre-LN to the remainder. As shown in Table 2, Pre-LN was consistently superior to MixLN in average performance (43.38% vs. 41.28%). Therefore, Pre-LN was adopted as the default normalization method in the final architecture. A more critical observation is that when comparing the model trained with synthetic (augmented) data against the non-synthetic data model under the same Pre-LN setup, no performance degradation or increase in loss spikes was observed. This suggests that, from a normalization standpoint, synthetic data does not introduce additional instability, providing positive evidence for RQ1. However, these results were obtained from a 1B parameter proxy model. Techniques like the MixLN family or stabilization methods for very deep networks such as DeepNorm may show more prominent potential at a larger model scale [Wang et al., 2024a]. Therefore, a re-evaluation is necessary for models with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters. 2.3 Attention Masking Method Attention masking has a significant impact on both training efficiency and performance because it directly dictates how context is formed in long sequence packing. We compared four masking strategies using a proxy model, and improved implementation efficiency by leveraging flash-style kernels [Dao et al., 2022, Dao, 2023]. \u2022 Causal masking: The standard method in which every token attends to all previous tokens. \u2022 Sliding causal masking: Tokens attend only to other tokens within a predefined window (1024 in this experiment). Windowed attention for long contexts is widely used in models like Longformer [Beltagy et al., 2020]. \u2022 Intra-document causal masking (Intra-doc): Blocks cross-document attention, allowing tokens to attend only to other tokens within the same document. A recent comparative study reports that intra-doc can improve downstream performance by reducing the noise that arises between documents during packing [Zhao et al., 2024]. \u2022", "[Beltagy et al., 2020]. \u2022 Intra-document causal masking (Intra-doc): Blocks cross-document attention, allowing tokens to attend only to other tokens within the same document. A recent comparative study reports that intra-doc can improve downstream performance by reducing the noise that arises between documents during packing [Zhao et al., 2024]. \u2022 Sliding intra-doc masking: Combines intra-doc masking with a sliding window. According to Table 3, Intra-doc masking achieved the highest performance with an average of 44.48%, surpassing standard causal masking (43.38%).

Intra-doc masking was the most effective, and the model trained on synthetic data achieved higher performance under the same conditions. independent context of each document by eliminating unnecessary contextual connections between them is effective [Zhao et al., 2024]. In contrast, the sliding-based methods may degrade performance by cutting off necessary long-range dependencies in long documents (similar observations are reported in the literature on windowed attention Beltagy et al., 2020). Based on these results, Intra-doc masking was adopted for the final model. Under the same Intra-doc setting, the model trained on synthetic data performed better than its non-synthetic counterpart, with almost no difference in the learning curve and loss volatility. This serves as additional evidence that synthetic data does not impair stability from an attention masking perspective, which further supports our findings for RQ1. However, as this experiment was conducted in a monolingual English setting, the control strategy for document boundaries and cross-references needs further exploration in a multilingual context. For instance, we did not explore methods like Cross-Lingual Document Attention (XLDA, Han et al., 2025), which could be a promising direction for future work. 2.4 Multi-Token Prediction Currently, large language models (LLMs) are primarily pre-trained and perform inference using the Next-Token Prediction (NTP) objective. However, the inherently sequential nature of NTP introduces significant latency, especially during inference, which constrains the real-time application of these models. [Gloeckle et al., 2024] Furthermore, its focus on predicting only a single token leaves room for optimization in terms of potential training efficiency. [Gloeckle et al., 2024] To overcome these limitations of NTP, Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has emerged as a noteworthy methodology. [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025b, Team, 2025b] MTP trains the model to predict several subsequent tokens simultaneously at each prediction step, offering two primary advantages: improved pre-training efficiency and accelerated inference speed. In this context, we investigate the impact of the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective, originally proposed in the DeepSeek-V3 architecture, on pre-training efficiency and downstream performance in small-scale language models. Specifically, we set our primary goal to conduct an", "step, offering two primary advantages: improved pre-training efficiency and accelerated inference speed. In this context, we investigate the impact of the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective, originally proposed in the DeepSeek-V3 architecture, on pre-training efficiency and downstream performance in small-scale language models. Specifically, we set our primary goal to conduct an in-depth analysis of the applicability and effec- tiveness of MTP on a model with approximately 1 billion parameters. To integrate MTP into the base architecture, it is necessary to extend the conventional Next-Token Prediction (NTP; n = 1) loss to calculate a loss based on multi-token predictions.

On the 1B-scale model, NTP showed higher overall average performance than MTP. Table 4 presents a direct comparison between Next Token Prediction (NTP) and Multi-Token Pre- diction (MTP) under identical pre-training conditions. Overall, MTP showed slightly lower average performance compared to NTP (41.35 vs. 43.38, approx. \u20132.0%p), suggesting that NTP remains a more effective general-purpose training objective for small-scale models. However, a different pattern was observed on a task-by-task basis. MTP outperformed NTP on Question Answering (QA) benchmarks such as BoolQ (+2.3%p), OBQA (+4.6%p), TFQA_mc1 6 (+5.8%p), and TFQA_mc2 (+8.9%p). This suggests that the training objective of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously provided a stronger signal for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or factual recall. In contrast, NTP showed a clear advantage on tasks that rely on precise next-token prediction, such as ARC-E, PIQA, and RACE. These results are consistent with findings reported in previous research Aynetdinov and Akbik [2025]. Small-scale language models may struggle to effectively handle the training complexity of MTP. Without sufficient capacity, they can show limitations in learning complex patterns and in generalization. In particular, the 1B parameter model used in this study, unlike models with tens of billions of parameters such as DeepSeek-V3 Mehra et al. [2025], can be interpreted as having structural and capacity constraints that prevent it from realizing the full potential of MTP. The scale of the data is also a critical factor. This study used a 60B token English web corpus, which is significantly smaller than the trillions of tokens used by recent very large-scale models. For example, DeepSeek-V3 was trained on 14.8 trillion tokens, and it is likely that a complex objective like MTP is more effective with such vast amounts of data. In contrast, in a limited data environment, MTP might lead to overfitting or fail to sufficiently learn complex relationships as intended by its design. In summary, we confirmed that NTP is a more stable and efficient training objective under the conditions of a small-scale model and limited data. Therefore, this study ultimately adopted NTP as the training objective, and no additional MTP experiments were conducted on the augmented data-based models. 3 Proposed Tokenizer based on Mixture of Datasets A tokenizer serves as a fundamental component that transforms raw text into", "conditions of a small-scale model and limited data. Therefore, this study ultimately adopted NTP as the training objective, and no additional MTP experiments were conducted on the augmented data-based models. 3 Proposed Tokenizer based on Mixture of Datasets A tokenizer serves as a fundamental component that transforms raw text into a sequence of tokens interpretable by language models. Achieving shorter sequences for identical text inputs, indicating superior compression, directly enhances both training and inference efficiency. Consequently, improv- ing compression performance constitutes a central challenge in tokenizer design. In this study, we investigate strategies to enhance compression within bilingual environments and, from the perspective of RQ2, conduct an in-depth analysis of the influence of synthetic data on tokenizer performance [Chai et al., 2024]. 3.1 Experiments Settings for Building Tokenizer from Scratch The tokenizer employed in our experiments was trained using the byte-level Byte Pair Encoding algorithm, which has been widely adopted in recent large language models [Radford et al., 2019]. Since byte-level BPE begins segmentation at the byte level rather than the character level, it can process any Unicode text without information loss and effectively eliminates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Experimental Setup We analyzed the effect of the synthetic data proportion on compression when training tokenizers using the byte-level BPE algorithm. As synthetic data sources, we sampled 20 GB each from Cosmopedia (English) and ko-Cosmopedia (Korean, internally constructed) [Ben Allal et al., 2024]. As representative non-synthetic corpora, we sampled 20 GB each from UltraFineWeb (English) and FineWeb2 (Korean) [Wang et al., 2025a, Penedo et al., 2024]. For evaluation, a subset of The Pile was used for non-synthetic measurements, while a portion of RLHF datasets for each language was used for synthetic measurements [Gao et al., 2020, Bai et al., 2022]. These datasets were selected because, beyond general web domains, they encompass diverse fields, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of compression performance. Table 5 summarizes the data composition. The model follows the previously proposed configuration. Evaluation Metrics Compression was measured using Bytes Per Token (BPT). A tokenizer that produces shorter token sequences for the same text yields a higher BPT, which indicates more efficient compression. However, since prior studies have shown that higher compression does not necessarily guarantee better downstream performance [Ali et al., 2024, Zuo et al., 2025], this study jointly evaluates both BPT and model downstream performance. To reflect the bilingual scenario, we evaluated downstream model performance using benchmark datasets in both Korean (Haerae, KMMLU, and KoBEST) [Son et al., 2023a, 2025a, Jang et al., 2022b] and English. 7 Split / Corpus Lang Category Sampling Size Train Cosmopedia EN Synthetic (encyclopedic) Random 20 GB ko-Cosmopedia KO Synthetic (encyclopedic) Random 20 GB UltraFineWeb EN Web (non-synthetic) Random 20 GB FineWeb-2 KO Web (non-synthetic) Random 20 GB Val.

Figure 1 and 2 present the results for English and Korean settings, respectively. The X-axis represents the ratio between synthetic and crawled data, while the Y-axis indicates compression performance measured in BPT. Overall, both languages exhibit an average compression gain as the proportion of synthetic data increases. A closer examination by domain, however, reveals several notable differences. For English, even within crawled domains, higher compression was observed when the synthetic proportion reached approximately 60% (see Ali et al., 2024 for discussion on the potential trade-off between compression and generalization). In contrast, for Korean, a substantially higher crawled data proportion\u2014around 80%\u2014was required to achieve comparable compression. This suggests that the 8 distributional gap between synthetic and crawled data is more pronounced in Korean than in English, potentially reflecting differences in language-specific knowledge and character-level properties [Son et al., 2023a, 2025a, Jang et al., 2022b].

Based on these observations, we constructed three tokenizer design candidates following three principles: (1) reflecting the optimal language-specific mixture, (2) leveraging the overall superiority of synthetic data, and (3) compensating for domain weaknesses. First, EK-Ratio incorporates the optimal synthetic\u2013crawled ratios for each language, as observed in Figures 1 and 2, directly into the tokenizer training mixture. Second, EK maintains the same English\u2013Korean ratio but trains exclusively on synthetic data for both languages to exploit its overall advantage. Third, EPK augments the mixture with additional code data to address weaknesses in code-related domains. Each tokenizer candidate was independently trained with vocabulary sizes of 125K and 196K. Subsequent analyses compare their BPT and downstream performance against commercial tokenizers. 3.3 Compression Comparison in Bilingual Settings with Commercial Tokenizers GPT4 Llama EK-Crawl-125k EK-Crawl-196k EK-125k EK-196k EPK-125k EPK-196k Models 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Compression 4.04 4.10 3.91 4.00 3.86 3.95 3.91 4.00 4.52 4.60 4.57 4.60 4.55 4.59 4.55 4.58 2.36 3.69 4.96 5.30 4.86 5.14 4.84 5.12 2.54 4.16 6.96 7.26 7.16 7.41 7.12 7.37 Comparison of Tokenizers across EN/KR and Crawl/Synth Domain EN-Crawl EN-Synth KR-Crawl KR-Synth Figure 3: Comparison of English and Korean compression performance between the tokenizer candidates defined in Table 6 and commercial tokenizers (GPT-4, LLaMA). We first examined whether the proposed tokenizer candidates achieve compression performance com- parable to that of commercial models (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-4). Figure 3 summarizes the compression results for both our candidates and the commercial tokenizers. As expected, byte-level BPE\u2013based tokenizers from the LLaMA family exhibit strong performance in English [Grattafiori et al., 2024, Radford et al., 2019], but their effectiveness in Korean is relatively limited. In contrast, the proposed tokenizer candidates maintained performance on par with commercial models in English domains, 9 while demonstrating a substantial advantage in Korean. This finding suggests that bilingual mixture and domain adjustment can enhance compression efficiency for non-Latin scripts [Ali et al., 2024, Chai et al., 2024]. We also examined the effect of vocabulary size on compression. Under identical training configurations, expanding the vocabulary generally improved compression by approximately 2\u20137%. This implies that while a larger vocabulary can yield compression benefits, it also introduces trade-offs related to model parameters and memory usage[Kudo and Richardson, 2018, Ali et al., 2024]. As noted earlier, compression is merely one of the intrinsic metrics for tokenizer quality. Thus, downstream model performance must also be evaluated [Ali et al., 2024]. Accordingly, we trained models using each tokenizer on 9B Korean tokens (FineWeb2) and 51B English tokens (Ultra- FineWeb) and assessed their performance across a range of downstream tasks. Since tokenization granularity differs across tokenizers, token counts were normalized using a single reference tokenizer (GPT-4 tokenizer) to ensure comparability at the \u201c60B-token\u201d scale [Radford et al., 2019]. 3.4", "on 9B Korean tokens (FineWeb2) and 51B English tokens (Ultra- FineWeb) and assessed their performance across a range of downstream tasks.

All evaluations were conducted under a 3-shot setting. The downstream performance results for both English and Korean are summarized as follows. In English, EK 125K achieved the best overall performance, followed by EPK 125K. Notably, despite commercial tokenizers exhibiting superior compression in English, models trained with our proposed tokenizers consistently achieved higher downstream performance. This finding suggests that the relationship between compression efficiency and downstream generalization is non-monotonic [Ali et al., 2024], highlighting that tokenizer design should be jointly optimized with the data mixture and the model\u2019s downstream performance rather than treating them as independent factors. In Korean, the proposed tokenizers also ranked among the top performers, with EPK 125K demon- strating the highest results. Meanwhile, vocabulary expansion yielded consistent gains in compression but tended to reduce average downstream performance in English (with a few exceptions such as EK-with-Crawl). Based on these observations, we excluded the 196K-vocabulary tokenizers from the final set of candidates [Ali et al., 2024]. 3.5 Safety of KORMo Tokenizers This section examines the presence of potentially harmful tokens (e.g., toxic or biased expressions) within the vocabularies of the proposed tokenizer candidates and compares them with Korean- specialized commercial models (Exaone, HyperCLOVA X, A.X,", "tokenizers from the final set of candidates [Ali et al., 2024]. 3.5 Safety of KORMo Tokenizers This section examines the presence of potentially harmful tokens (e.g., toxic or biased expressions) within the vocabularies of the proposed tokenizer candidates and compares them with Korean- specialized commercial models (Exaone, HyperCLOVA X, A.X, and Midm).

We found that several Korean-specialized models also contained a non-negligible number 11 of harmful tokens, with the HyperCLOVA X family exhibiting relatively higher proportions. In contrast, English-centric models such as LLaMA and GPT showed minimal Korean coverage in their vocabularies under our counting criteria, thereby limiting the detection of harmful Korean tokens\u2014an observation that itself suggests constraints in their expressive capacity for Korean. Figure 4 further confirms the very low proportion of Korean tokens in these models. Overall, the proposed candidates (EK and EPK) contained comparatively fewer harmful tokens. However, the inclusion of crawled data tended to increase the number of such tokens. This finding indicates that", "in their expressive capacity for Korean. Figure 4 further confirms the very low proportion of Korean tokens in these models. Overall, the proposed candidates (EK and EPK) contained comparatively fewer harmful tokens. However, the inclusion of crawled data tended to increase the number of such tokens. This finding indicates that data source characteristics can influence the formation of bias during tokenizer training. In light of this concern, we excluded crawled data from the final tokenizer training configuration [Penedo et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2025a]. Considering all the aforementioned factors, EPK-125K was selected as the final tokenizer. 4 Pretraining Phase This section introduces our proposed approach for collecting and generating pre-training data, as well as the methodology for constructing training stages that account for data quality and difficulty. 4.1 Pretraining Datasets Language Dataset Name # tokens # origin tok Reasoning Synthetic Synthesizer Seed Stage English DCLM2 1,000B 6,000B X X - - stage 1 UltraFineWeb3 793B 1,000B X X - - stage 2 Nemotron-CC-web4 280B 4,400B X X - - stage 2 Nemotron-CC-synthetic 1,000B 1,900B X O Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct Nemotron-CC-HQ stage 2 stack-edu5 152B \u2013 X X - - stage 2 Fine-math6 37.3B \u2013 X X - - stage 2 Cosmopedia7 25B \u2013 X O Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 Cosmopedia seed suite8 stage 2 OpenCodeReasoning9 5.46B \u2013 O O DeepSeek-R1 - stage 2 OpenMathReasoning10 24.89B \u2013 O O DeepSeek-R1, QwQ-32B - stage 2 Korean Ko-Web Datasets 36.3B 837B X X - - stage 1 Ko-CC-Dump 6.2B 251B X X - - stage 1 Korean Opensource 5.57B \u2013 X X - - stage 2 Synth-FineWeb2 10.97B \u2013 X O Qwen3-30B-A3B FineWeb211 stage 2 Synth-Nemo-HQ 32.82B \u2013 X O Qwen3-30B-A3B Nemotron-HQ stage 2 Kosmopedia 4.07B \u2013 X O GPT-oss (120B) cosmopedia stage 2 Synth-Ultrafineweb 41.69B \u2013 X O GPT-oss (120B) Ultrafineweb stage 2 Ko-Reasoning 7.05B \u2013 O O Qwen3-235B-A22B Nemotron-Post stage 2 English + Korean total pretraining tokens: 3,462.32B Table 10: Comparison of English and Korean pretraining datasets used in KORMo. Each dataset is categorized by reasoning trace inclusion, synthetic nature, synthesizer model, and training stage. The underlined datasets indicate generated synthetic data produced in-house. Pre-training is the most resource-intensive and labor-demanding stage in building a language model. For KORMo\u2019s pre-training, we collected and generated large-scale, high-quality text corpora. Table 10 summarizes the composition of the primary pre-training datasets. The data were obtained through both direct collection (web crawling and the use of publicly available datasets) and synthetic generation, encompassing general web text, domain-specific materials, and various auxiliary datasets. 4.1.1 Public Data Collection English Public Data. We first collected publicly available high-quality datasets and utilized them for KORMo\u2019s pre-training. As summarized in Table 10, all English data were sourced from open 2github.com/mlfoundations/dclm 3huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/Ultra-FineWeb 4data.commoncrawl.org/contrib/Nemotron/Nemotron-CC/index.html 5huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/stack-edu 6huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/finemath 7huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/finemath 8Web-text, stanford.edu, UltraChat, OpenHermes2.5, OpenStax, KhanAcademy, AutoMathText 9huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenCodeReasoning 10huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning 11huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-2 12 datasets and further refined through additional filtering processes before use. Specifically, the web corpora provided by DCLM [Li et al., 2024], UltraFineWeb [Wang et al., 2025b], and Nemotron- CC [Su et al., 2024a] are high-quality datasets constructed through multi-stage filtering based on Common Crawl, serving as the foundation for general", "datasets and further refined through additional filtering processes before use. Specifically, the web corpora provided by DCLM [Li et al., 2024], UltraFineWeb [Wang et al., 2025b], and Nemotron- CC [Su et al., 2024a] are high-quality datasets constructed through multi-stage filtering based on Common Crawl, serving as the foundation for general language understanding. In addition, Nemotron- synthetic is a synthetic dataset generated from Nemotron-web, while Cosmopedia is a synthetic corpus built using RefinedWeb [Penedo et al., 2023] and RedPajama [Weber et al., 2024] as seed data, included to enhance the generalization performance of large-scale language models. Additionally, for foundational training in mathematics and coding, we utilized the Stack-Edu and Fine-Math datasets, while the OpenCodeReasoning and OpenMathReasoning datasets were incorporated to further enhance higher-order reasoning abilities. Through this multi-layered data composition, KORMo was designed to acquire diverse forms of knowledge across multiple domains. Korean Public Data. For Korean data, publicly available pre-training resources are extremely limited. Therefore, we collected data from two primary sources: existing open resources and raw dumps directly parsed from Common Crawl. \u2022 Korean Opensource: We collected writing, news, and document summarization data from the National Institute of Korean Language\u2019s Modu Corpus12, and included the academic paper dataset provided by KISTI13. These corpora are released by reputable Korean research institutions, ensuring both reliability and quality. \u2022 Ko-Web Datasets: We utilized Korean datasets released by international research communi- ties, including community-OSCAR14, CulturaX15, and FineWeb2 v2.0.016. However, these datasets share a limitation in that their knowledge cutoff extends only up to 2023. \u2022 Ko-CC-Dump: To ensure data freshness, we directly extracted Korean text from the raw dumps of Common Crawl. Specifically, we parsed WARC files from four dumps, 2025- 13, 2025-18, 2025-20, and 2025-21, corresponding to web crawl data collected between March 15 and May 25, 2025. This approach follows the findings reported in DCLM, which demonstrated that directly parsing WARC files yields higher-quality data than relying on preprocessed WET files. For data extraction, we used the datatrove library and employed resiliparse to ensure efficient and stable processing. The language identification provided by Common Crawl (based on CLD2) exhibited low accuracy; therefore, we implemented a new language filtering process using fastText\u2019s LID- 176 model. The classification threshold was set to 0.8 to minimize noise while maintaining high recall for Korean text. Although only four subsets were utilized in this study due to time constraints, all additional subsets will be released in the future to support further research17. 4.1.2 Synthetic Data Generation For non-English languages, particularly Korean, publicly available pretraining data with permissive licenses remains extremely scarce. This poses a fundamental limitation for building fully open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we do not simply aim to increase the volume of training data. Instead, we empirically investigate methods for effectively transferring knowledge from English- centric corpora into Korean through controlled augmentation strategies. Recent work, such as Nemotron-CC-HQ, has demonstrated the practical utility of augmenting limited seed data through various transformations, including QA-style conversions, sentence rephrasings, and Wikipedia-style rewrites. Building on this approach, we generate large-scale Korean data using high-quality English seed corpora as input.", "centric corpora into Korean through controlled augmentation strategies. Recent work, such as Nemotron-CC-HQ, has demonstrated the practical utility of augmenting limited seed data through various transformations, including QA-style conversions, sentence rephrasings, and Wikipedia-style rewrites. Building on this approach, we generate large-scale Korean data using high-quality English seed corpora as input. However, we note that directly transferring Anglocentric cultural contexts or lifestyle content may limit the downstream applicability of Korean models. To mitigate this, we introduced prompt design constraints that reflect Korean-specific context and usage scenarios. We also constructed multiple seed pools to promote diversity in format, narrative style, and content, even when using the same English input. In total, we constructed five Korean augmentation datasets, each derived from a distinct combination of English seed data and prompt strategy. 12https://kli.korean.go.kr/corpus/main/requestMain.do?lang=ko 13https://aida.kisti.re.kr/data/ 14https://huggingface.co/datasets/oscar-corpus/community-oscar 15https://huggingface.co/datasets/uonlp/CulturaX 16https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-2 17https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLP-KTLim/Kor-CC-Resili-Parsed 13 \u2022 Synth-FineWeb2: Korean responses generated from FineWeb2 seed data using custom- designed prompts. \u2022 Synth-UltraFineWeb: Korean outputs generated by appending the instruction \u201canswer in Korean\u201d to Nemotron-CC English prompts. \u2022 Synth-Nemo-HQ: Korean data generated by translating Nemotron-CC-HQ prompts into Korean prior to synthesis. \u2022 Kosmopedia: Korean data generated from Cosmopedia seed texts using custom-designed Korean prompts. \u2022 Ko-Reasoning: Constructed by pairing each English query from Nemotron-Post with a corresponding Korean reasoning trace and answer. To ensure diversity, we generated augmented datasets from five distinct English sources. These sources differ in domain, narrative style, and knowledge density, enabling broad and high-quality knowledge transfer into Korean. However, as noted in RQ1, the use of synthetic data raises concerns about its potential impacts on training stability and long-term model performance. To assess this, we adopted an evaluation methodology similar to that proposed in the Nemotron-HQ study. Specifically, we applied our tokenizer to the proxy model selected in Section 2 and conducted pretraining with 4B tokens from each augmented dataset. We then evaluated the resulting models on downstream tasks. Experimental results show that the Kosmopedia-based data yielded the strongest performance, and most other augmented datasets also outperformed models trained on standard Korean web corpora. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the robustness and effectiveness of synthetic data, as raised in RQ1, and suggest that large-scale synthetic pretraining is a viable strategy for building open-source LLMs in low-resource languages. 4.1.3 Data Filtering Model performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pre-training data, which is not only the largest in volume but also predominantly sourced from the web. To address this, various filtering techniques are applied to extract high-quality text from the raw collected data. In our work, we apply a three-stage filtering pipeline: Heuristic Filtering, Deduplication, and Quality Filtering. The specifics of this process are detailed below. Heuristic Filtering We applied heuristic filtering to all collected Korean web data. Heuristic filtering refers to a rule-based approach for removing various forms of noise present in text. We identify and eliminate texts of extreme length, often caused by crawling errors, and instances of excessive repetition of special characters. Since such data be detrimental to model training, we strictly removed them through a well-defined pipeline. Our heuristic filtering pipeline was primarily based on", "of noise present in text. We identify and eliminate texts of extreme length, often caused by crawling errors, and instances of excessive repetition of special characters. Since such data be detrimental to model training, we strictly removed them through a well-defined pipeline. Our heuristic filtering pipeline was primarily based on the method proposed by [Li et al., 2024]. 1. Initial Preprocessing \u2013 We first performed text normalization to ensure consistent process- ing across all samples. Consecutive spaces or tabs were reduced to a single space, sequences of three or more newline characters were replaced with two newlines, and any CR/CRLF sequences exceeding two were also normalized to two newlines. Samples that became empty after normalization were discarded. 2. Word-Count Filter \u2013 To remove documents with extreme lengths, which typically result from crawling errors, we applied a word-count filter. For computational efficiency, words were defined as space-delimited tokens. Documents with fewer than 10 or more than 10,000 words were discarded. 3. Non-Alphabetic Word Ratio Filter \u2013 We filtered documents containing a high proportion of non-alphabetic words (i.e., tokens composed entirely of digits or symbols). Samples with a ratio of such non-alphabetic words exceeding 0.25 were discarded. 4. Alphabetic\u2013Numeric Character Ratio Filter \u2013 Conversely, samples in which the pro- portion of meaningful characters like letters or digits, within the entire text was too low were removed. Texts dominated by special symbols are likely to represent advertisements or structured markup rather than natural language. The cutoff threshold was set to 0.25. 5. Symbol Ratio Filter \u2013 Samples containing an excessive number of specific symbols relative to their word count were identified as noise and removed. This filter primar- ily targets template-like, spam, or table-corrupted text. The monitored symbols were 14 [\"#\", \"...\", \". . .\", \"\\u2026\"], and samples exceeding a ratio of 0.1 were dropped. 6. N-gram Repetition Filter \u2013 Samples exhibiting excessive repetition of contiguous n-grams were removed, as they can induce undesirable repetition patterns during model training. We analyzed contiguous n-grams of lengths 8 to 10 and discarded any document with a repetition ratio exceeding 0.2. 7. Line-Ellipsis Ratio Filter \u2013 We removed documents where a large fraction of lines termi- nated with an ellipsis ({\u2018...\u2019, \u2018. . .\u2019, \u2018\\u2026\u2019}). Such incomplete sentences are prevalent in web data and provide low-quality signals for language modeling. Documents exceeding a line-ellipsis ratio of 0.3 were dropped. 8. Bullet Point Ratio Filter \u2013 Documents where a high proportion of lines began with bullet symbols ([\u2019\u25cf\u2019, \u2019\u2022\u2019, \u2019*\u2019, \u2019-\u2019]) were removed, as they typically represent lists or navigational content rather than natural language prose. The removal threshold for this ratio was set to 0.9. Removing duplicate or repetitive data is a crucial step in all stages of model training. To achieve this, we adopted the Bloom Filter\u2013based deduplication method (BFF)18 proposed in DCLM, following the original study\u2019s hyperparameter settings. The BFF framework provides two modes of deduplication: document and old-both. The document mode preserves more tokens but applies a relatively lenient deduplication threshold, whereas old-both enforces a stricter criterion for removing redundant samples. we performed cross-deduplication sequentially", "deduplication method (BFF)18 proposed in DCLM, following the original study\u2019s hyperparameter settings. The BFF framework provides two modes of deduplication: document and old-both. The document mode preserves more tokens but applies a relatively lenient deduplication threshold, whereas old-both enforces a stricter criterion for removing redundant samples. we performed cross-deduplication sequentially across FineWeb2, CulturaX, our internally crawled CC-Dump, and Community-OSCAR. However, unlike for English, the volume of available training data in Korean is significantly more limited, making the decisions regarding the intensity of the filtering process particularly critical. The Deduplication column in Table 11 reports the performance of Korean models trained using the Document and Old-both deduplication methods in combination with Quality Filtering (QF). As clearly shown in the results, models trained on data processed with the stricter Old-both method consistently outperform those trained with the Document method across all evaluation metrics. This suggests that in pre-training dataset construction, enhancing data quality by minimizing redundancy has a more decisive impact on final model performance than simply increasing the quantity of data. However, applying the Old-both method resulted in the removal of approximately 70% of the entire Korean corpus, as those samples were identified as duplicates. This substantial reduction reveals that a large portion of publicly available open-source Korean datasets significantly overlap with one another, leaving a limited amount of truly unique and usable content. Despite the reduction, we selected the Old-both\u2013deduplicated dataset as our final version, given its clear and consistent performance gains across all evaluation metrics.

All experiments use a 1B proxy model trained on 40B Korean tokens extracted from the full Korean corpus. Quality Filtering Following cross-corpus deduplication to mitigate redundancy, we performed a quality filtering step to ensure the reliability of the training corpus. In large-scale language model pretraining, data quality is a pivotal factor influencing downstream performance. Web-sourced corpora often contain toxic content\u2014including profanity, hate speech, and social biases\u2014as well as low- information text such as spam, templated phrases, and boilerplate. Accordingly, rigorous filtering is 18https://github.com/mlfoundations/dclm/tree/main/dedup/bff 19https://github.com/allenai/bff 15 Samples Category Version 1 Version 2 Version 3 Version 4 Positive Samples (300k) Korean-Opensource 122,340 122,340 90,000 90,000 Instruction-Following 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 Qwen-annotated (>3) 37,660 37,660 37,660 37,660 Synthetic-LLM 90,000 90,000 122,340 122,340 Negative Samples (300k) Qwen-annotated (=0)", "templated phrases, and boilerplate.

Versions [1,2] emphasize balanced sources, while Versions [3,4] increase the proportion of synthetic datasets. essential to exclude such low-quality samples and construct a cleaner, high-quality dataset suitable for robust model training. Quality filtering is typically performed by assigning a score between 0 and 5 to each input text using a classifier and removing data below a set threshold. Both DCLM and UltraFineWeb [Wang et al., 2025b] report that fastText-based classifiers are efficient and effective for this task. For English web data, we additionally applied the fastText-based UltraFineWeb filter, despite the data having already undergone initial filtering, based on reports that it outperforms the DCLM-style classifiers used in earlier stages. For Korean data, we constructed a dedicated quality classifier, as no pre-existing model was available. Following the approaches of DCLM and UltraFineWeb, we designed a fastText-based classifier tailored to Korean. Using translated scoring prompts from FineWeb-Edu [Penedo et al., 2024], we employed Qwen3-32B to assign scores (0\u20135) to approximately 400K samples from the Korean portion of community-OSCAR (Figure 5). 0 1 2 3 4 5 Score 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 Count Score Distribution Scores (%) 0 (63.16%) 1 (26.47%) 2 (7.76%) 3 (1.83%) 4 (0.56%) 5 (0.22%) Figure 5: Distribution of quality scores assigned to 400K Korean community-OSCAR samples using Qwen3-32B with translated FineWeb-Edu scoring prompts. The majority of samples were rated as 0, indicating low or no educational value. To account for variations in classifier effectiveness depending on the choice of positive and negative samples, we designed four versions of fastText-based quality classifiers (Table 12). Positive samples included: (i) Korean-Opensource (public datasets released by official institutions), (ii) Ko-Reasoning data, (iii) Qwen-annotated samples with scores \u22653, and (iv) Synth-FineWeb2 data. Negative samples consisted of: (i) Qwen-annotated samples with a score of 0, and (ii) randomly selected samples from community-OSCAR. Each classifier was trained on 300K positive and 300K negative samples. We 16 then applied each classifier to filter 40B tokens of Korean data and trained a KORMo-1B proxy model to assess filtering effectiveness (Table 11). Our analysis yields two key insights: 1. Effect of Negative Sample Composition: Version 2, which utilized randomly sampled web data as negative examples, achieved higher average performance than Version 1, which used explicitly labeled low-quality (score 0) samples. This suggests that exposing the classifier to a broader spectrum of naturally occurring low-quality patterns on the web is more beneficial for generalization than training solely on narrowly defined \u201cpoor-quality\u201d data. 2. Effect of Positive Sample Composition: Versions 1 and 2, primarily composed of curated, high-quality web data, consistently outperformed Versions 3 and", "exposing the classifier to a broader spectrum of naturally occurring low-quality patterns on the web is more beneficial for generalization than training solely on narrowly defined \u201cpoor-quality\u201d data. 2. Effect of Positive Sample Composition: Versions 1 and 2, primarily composed of curated, high-quality web data, consistently outperformed Versions 3 and 4, which contained a higher proportion of synthetic data. This result reaffirms the intrinsic value of high-quality, authentic data. However, due to the absolute scarcity of high-quality Korean web data, incorporating synthetic data remains necessary to acquire the trillions of tokens required for large-scale pre-training. Overall, Version 2 proved to be the most effective filtering strategy. Accordingly, we adopted the Version 2\u2013based fastText classifier to refine the entire Korean corpus used for KORMo\u2019s pre-training dataset. 4.2 Pretraining We initiated pre-training only after completing all stages of data preparation. This section explores the core components of KORMo\u2019s pre-training from the following three perspectives: \u2022 Optimal Learning Rate Search: Determining an appropriate learning rate configuration for the proposed architecture and data environment. \u2022 Language Ratio: Adjusting the proportion of Korean and English data across training stages. \u2022 Synthetic Data Ratio:Examining the potential limitations arising from an overreliance on synthetic data. 4.2.1 Optimal Learning Rate Search One of the most critical early decisions in pre-training is the selection of an appropriate learning rate. The learning rate significantly influences both convergence speed and final performance: excessively high values can lead to divergence or unstable oscillations, while excessively low values may result in slow learning or convergence to a suboptimal state. Since the optimal learning rate can vary substantially depending on model size and architecture, we conducted a direct search using the target model, KORMo-10B. KORMo-10B was built upon the proposed training design, incorporating Pre-LN architecture, intra- document masking, a next-token prediction objective, and a custom-developed bilingual tokenizer. The learning rate search was conducted with a global batch size of 1024 and a sequence length of 4096 over 2,000 steps, exploring candidate values in the range of {1e-4, 3e-4, 5e-4, 7e-4, 9e-4, 1e-3, 1.5e-3, 3e-3}. To closely approximate real training conditions, a randomly sampled subset of the entire pretraining corpus was used during this search. The results presented in Figure 6 reveal distinct optimization patterns across different learning rates. \u2022 High learning rates (e.g., 3e-3) led to rapid initial loss reduction but soon caused oscillations and instability. \u2022 Low learning rates (e.g., 1e-4) exhibited highly stable convergence but progressed too slowly to reach optimal performance. \u2022 Moderate learning rates (7e-4, 9e-4) achieved both stability and fast convergence, with 7e-4 yielding the lowest overall loss across all steps. Accordingly, we adopted a learning rate of 7e-4 as the optimal setting for the final model training. This result demonstrates that, under the architecture and data environment of KORMo-10B, this configuration enables stable convergence and efficient optimization. 17 Figure 6: Comparison of loss curves across different learning rates during KORMo-10B pre-training. 0.0T 0.2T 0.4T 0.6T 0.8T 1.0T 1.2T 1.4T 1.6T 1.8T 2.0T 2.2T 2.4T 2.6T 2.8T Trained Tokens (Trillion) 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 Average Score English Evaluation", "configuration enables stable convergence and efficient optimization. 17 Figure 6: Comparison of loss curves across different learning rates during KORMo-10B pre-training. 0.0T 0.2T 0.4T 0.6T 0.8T 1.0T 1.2T 1.4T 1.6T 1.8T 2.0T 2.2T 2.4T 2.6T 2.8T Trained Tokens (Trillion) 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 Average Score English Evaluation English Average Score Stage 1 Stage 2 (a) English Tasks Average Score 0.0T 0.2T 0.4T 0.6T 0.8T 1.0T 1.2T 1.4T 1.6T 1.8T 2.0T 2.2T 2.4T 2.6T 2.8T Trained Tokens (Trillion) 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 Average Score Korean Evaluation Korean Average Score Stage 1 Stage 2 (b) Korean Tasks Average Score Figure 7: Comparison of Average Performance between English and Korean Evaluation Tasks During Pretraining stages. 4.2.2 Proposed Language Ratio and Pre-training Stages Language Proportion. In bilingual language models, the data ratio between the two languages serves as a crucial determinant of model performance. Previous studies have shown that even when the target language accounts for as little as 1.14% of the total data in a multilingual setting, a reasonable level of performance can still be achieved Xue et al. [2021]. In contrast, LLaMA-2 includes only about 0.06% Korean data, making it practically infeasible to assess Korean performance meaningfully. Although systematic investigations of language ratios in bilingual settings are limited, recent research has reported that increasing the target language proportion to 1.5\u20135% can still maintain competitive performance Seto et al. [2025]. However, such results may vary substantially depending on interlingual similarity and data quality. Taking into account the structural heterogeneity between English and Korean, this study set the Korean data proportion to over 5% to ensure stable bilingual learning. Training Phase. Recent trends in LLM pre-training adopt multi-stage training strategies that progressively increase data quality to leverage the benefits of curriculum learning. In the case of KORMo, due to practical constraints that limit the total number of training tokens to below 3T under the chosen Korean\u2013English ratio, we adopted a two-stage pre-training strategy. \u2022 Stage 1: Approximately 1T tokens were trained primarily on relatively low-quality web data. Specifically, this stage included DCLM (960B), Korean Web (36.3B), and Korean-CC (6.2B) datasets corresponding to the \u201cstage1\u201d entries in Table 10. The objective of this stage 18 is to enable the model to acquire fundamental language understanding from large-scale web text and to develop robustness against noisy data. \u2022 Stage 2: The model is trained on high-quality web text, synthetic data, and low-difficulty reasoning datasets that include short reasoning paths. As shown in the \u201cstage2\u201d entries of Table 10, this stage comprises a total of 1.8T tokens (1.7T in English and 0.1T in Korean). Building upon the foundational language abilities acquired in Stage 1, this phase aims to strengthen advanced language understanding and reasoning capabilities by incorporating structured and higher-quality data.

Table 13 summarizes the configuration of the KORMo-10B model. The key training settings are as follows. \u2022 Model Architecture: Reflecting the findings presented in section 2, the model employs a transformer decoder with a Pre-LN architecture. Training is conducted using intra-document attention masking and a next-token prediction objective, while the flash-attention-3 ker- nel [Shah et al., 2024] is applied to improve computational efficiency. \u2022 Context length: By default, sequence packing was applied based on a sequence length of 4096. However, for reasoning datasets, packing was avoided since it could negatively affect coherence by truncating connected reasoning chains. Instead, sample-level padding was applied without additional packing. \u2022 Weight decay: Following the approach of the OLMo study [OLMo et al., 2024], weight decay was not applied to token embeddings. This decision was made to prevent undesirable side effects, such as excessive shrinkage of embedding vector magnitudes. \u2022 Initialize optimizer: At the beginning of each stage, the optimizer is reinitialized to ensure stable adaptation to the shift in data distribution, and a learning rate warm-up of 0.03% of the total training steps is applied. \u2022 Training Resources: All experiments were conducted in a multinode environment using NVIDIA H200 GPUs, with a total of 128 GPUs utilized in parallel. Considering the model size and number of parameters, the Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) [Zhao et al., 2023] strategy was adopted to enable parameter sharding across nodes and efficient memory utilization. Figure 7 illustrates the average English and Korean evaluation performance as a function of the number of training tokens during pre-training. The English evaluation comprises 12 benchmarks\u2014MMLU, 19 BoolQ, COPA, ARC-Challenge, ARC-Easy, AGIEval-EN, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA, PIQA, HellaSwag, SocialIQA, and Winogrande\u2014and the Korean evaluation consists of six benchmarks: KMMLU, CSATQA, CLICK, Haerae, K2-Eval, and KoBEST. The observations indicate that in Stage 1, both languages exhibited a sharp performance improvement, suggesting that the model rapidly acquired fundamental linguistic knowledge and syntactic structures. In Stage 2, the performance curve transitioned into a more gradual upward trend, implying that the high-quality data refined the model\u2019s existing capabilities and progressively enhanced its reasoning ability. However, as shown in Figure 7b, the Korean performance curve exhibits more pronounced oscillations compared to the English curve in Figure 7a. This variability in Korean performance can be attributed to two main factors: (1) the relatively low proportion of Korean data in the pretraining corpus, which may lead to instability in internal representations; and (2) the smaller number of evaluation benchmarks for Korean (six) compared to English (twelve), causing individual benchmark fluctuations to have a greater impact on the overall average. Nevertheless, by the end of Stage 2, Korean performance", "data in the pretraining corpus, which may lead to instability in internal representations; and (2) the smaller number of evaluation benchmarks for Korean (six) compared to English (twelve), causing individual benchmark fluctuations to have a greater impact on the overall average. Nevertheless, by the end of Stage 2, Korean performance stabilized at an average score above 0.55, confirming that the KORMo model achieved robust bilingual performance. Meanwhile, when the total number of training tokens exceeded 2.8T, additional performance gains were observed. However, considering cost-effectiveness, we concluded that allocating the same computational resources to mid-training or post-training stages would be a more reasonable strategy. 4.3 Impact of Augmented Data Diversity 0.0T 0.2T 0.4T 0.6T 0.8T 1.0T 1.2T 1.4T 1.6T 1.8T Trained Tokens (Trillion) 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 Average Score English Evaluation Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 2 (Failure) (a) English Tasks Average Score 0.0T 0.2T 0.4T 0.6T 0.8T 1.0T 1.2T 1.4T 1.6T 1.8T Trained Tokens (Trillion) 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 Average Score Korean Evaluation Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 2 (Failure) (b) Korean Tasks Average Score Figure 8: Graph illustrating a failed pretraining case using a single synthetic dataset. KORMo began leveraging large-scale augmented data in Stage 2. However, we observed that insuffi- cient diversity in the augmented data at this stage led to severe adverse effects during model training. The Stage 2 (Failure) curve in Figure 8 presents results obtained under the same configuration as the standard Stage 2 setup, except that the Korean augmented data consisted solely of samples generated by a single synthesizer, Synth-Nemo-HQ. This comparison allows us to examine the impact of using augmented data generated from multiple synthesizers versus that produced by a single synthesizer on language model training. Examining the performance of the Stage 2 (Failure) model reveals that neither language maintained the peak performance achieved in Stage 1; instead, both experienced overall degradation accompanied by pronounced oscillations. Specifically, English performance fluctuated unstably within the range of 0.55\u20130.63, while Korean performance declined even more sharply, reverting to levels comparable to the early Stage 1 phase. This abrupt and irreversible degradation is interpreted as a manifestation of model collapse. The primary causes of this collapse can be inferred as follows: 1. Single-Model-Based Synthetic Data: All Korean data were generated solely from a single model (Qwen3-30B-A3B), which may have caused the repeated learning of that model\u2019s inherent biases and errors Shumailov et al. [2024], Long et al. [2024], Bukharin et al. [2024]. Particularly in refined training stages such as Stage 2, the lack of diversity in synthetic data 20 led to a rapid loss of the model\u2019s broad knowledge distribution Shumailov et al. [2023b], Chen et al. [2024], Gerstgrasser et al. [2024]. 2. Uniformity of Seed and Prompt Types: When the seed data and prompt types are limited, the resulting synthetic data distribution becomes narrow. This constraint can lead the model to overfit to restricted patterns, potentially causing the loss of general language understanding and reasoning abilities acquired during Stage 1 Bukharin et al. [2024]. In summary, while the use of augmented data", "and prompt types are limited, the resulting synthetic data distribution becomes narrow. This constraint can lead the model to overfit to restricted patterns, potentially causing the loss of general language understanding and reasoning abilities acquired during Stage 1 Bukharin et al. [2024]. In summary, while the use of augmented data is essential for high-quality training, our findings demonstrate that relying on limited seeds, models, or prompt types in synthetic data generation can lead to severe performance degradation. Therefore, in large-scale bilingual language model development, ensuring not only the quantity but also the diversity of augmented data is imperative for stable and effective learning. 5 Mid-training Recent language models have diversified according to their intended applications, leading to the gradual standardization of the mid-training stage. In reasoning-oriented models, the ability to compre- hend long contexts and internalize complex reasoning processes is essential, thereby necessitating an intermediate training phase following pre-training [Liu et al., 2024, Gao et al., 2025a]. The KORMo model was similarly designed with two primary objectives for its mid-training stage: (1) to extend context length and (2) to enhance reasoning capability. 5.1 Long Context Training Recent studies have shown that reasoning tasks require long-form outputs containing complex reasoning traces. Consequently, long-context training during the mid-training phase is essential to ensure that models can reliably process both long inputs and outputs [Liu et al., 2024]. Following recent studies, we adopted a similar long-context training procedure for KORMo to enhance its capability in complex reasoning and long-text comprehension. Data Preparation. For the English dataset, we followed the approach proposed in ProLong [Gao et al., 2025b], utilizing the prolong-data-64k corpus while truncating sequences to a maximum length of 32k tokens. For the Korean dataset, we reconstructed large-scale long-form texts into book-level documents and repacked them to approximately 32k tokens, thereby adapting them for long-context training. In addition, prior studies have reported that training only on long documents may degrade performance in domains such as mathematics and code [Dong et al., 2025]. To mitigate this issue, we adopted a mixed training strategy that incorporates relatively short, high-quality data. Specifically, short Korean synthetic datasets were also packed to roughly 32k tokens and integrated into the long-context training corpus to balance the model\u2019s ability between long-context comprehension and short-form reasoning [Gao et al., 2025a]. Language Dataset Name Origin # tokens English ProLong princeton-nlp/prolong-data-64K 7.21B Korean Ko-book AI-Hub 1.11B Kosmopedia cosmopedia (English) 0.51B Koneedle Ko-Web Datasets (in Table 10) 1.44B English + Korean total Reasoning tokens: 10.27B Table 14: Overview of Korean and English datasets used in the Reasoning Mid Train stage, including their sources and token counts. Furthermore, during Korean long-form QA tasks, we observed that the model produced responses in English due to limited Korean exposure. To address this issue, we constructed Needle-in-a-Haystack- style data, designed to evaluate and improve the model\u2019s ability to retrieve specific information 21 Figure 9: Performance of KORMo-10B models on the Needle In A Haystack benchmark for English (top row) and Korean (bottom row). Color intensity denotes retrieval accuracy per document depth and context length. randomly inserted into 32k-token documents.

Color intensity denotes retrieval accuracy per document depth and context length. randomly inserted into 32k-token documents. The final datasets used for long-context extension consisted of 7.21B tokens in English and 3.06B tokens in Korean. Experimental Results on Long Context Extension To evaluate KORMo\u2019s ability to retrieve information within long contexts, we employed a English\u2013Korean bilingual version of the Needle In A Haystack (NIAH) benchmark. This benchmark measures a model\u2019s capacity to accurately locate and extract specific information randomly inserted within documents of up to 127K tokens in length. Figure 9 presents the evaluation results. The baseline KORMo-10B-longcontext model achieved an accuracy of 99.04% in English and 69.04% in Korean, while the YarnX4-extended model recorded 98.97% in English and 63.15% in Korean. For English, both models maintained almost perfect performance across all input lengths, demon- strating stable retrieval capability even beyond the 32K context window. This result confirms the robustness and effectiveness of the long-context training procedure. In contrast, Korean performance gradually declined beyond the 13K token range, dropping below 60% accuracy after 21K tokens. Although the YarnX4-based model exhibited greater stability in certain segments, a degradation appeared between 82K and 118K tokens. These results suggest that for Korean, stable information retrieval capabilities in long contexts have not yet been fully established. This outcome may be attributed to a complex interplay of factors, including tokenizer instability, imbalances in the synthetic data, and domain bias within the long- context dataset. Consequently, further improvements in data design and augmentation strategies specifically tailored for Korean long-context learning are required. 5.2 Reasoning Context Training The second phase of mid-training, Reasoning Context Training, aims to improve the model\u2019s reasoning ability by training on datasets containing large-scale reasoning traces. This stage is performed after long-context extension and is designed to efficiently elicit reasoning capabilities and help the model internalize advanced inference patterns Bakouch et al. [2025b], Team [2025b]. Data Preparation. Table 5.2 summarizes the dataset composition used in this stage. Prior studies have shown that emphasizing reasoning traces in STEM, coding, and math domains can improve 22 general model performance Bakouch et al. [2025b], DeepSeek-AI et al. [2025b], Team [2025b]. Based on this observation, we prioritized STEM, coding, and math domains when constructing the subset from Nemotron-Post-v1, and incorporated the full OpenThoughts dataset to broaden coverage. To further support general reasoning ability, we added QA pairs from the reasoning-relevant portion of Nemotron\u2019s chat domain. We reuse the Ko-Reasoning corpus constructed during pretraining (Section 4.1), as there are no publicly available large-scale reasoning datasets for Korean. Since Ko-Reasoning contains limited coverage of STEM, coding, and math domains, we supplement it by translating selected portions of the Nemotron dataset. To ensure effective reasoning supervision, we apply difficulty-based filtering and retain only high-quality samples that demonstrably require reasoning traces.

Stage 1 selects for samples incorrectly answered by two models, and Stage 2 filters for a consensus on high difficulty. 1: Input: Annotated dataset D with model answers and difficulty labels 2: Output: Final high-difficulty subset D\u2032 3: P \u2190\u2205 \u25b7candidate pool 4: D\u2032 \u2190\u2205 \u25b7final dataset for translation 5: Stage 1: Non-Reasoning Sample Filtering 6: for d \u2208D do 7: if ISINCORRECT(Qwen-30B) and ISINCORRECT(Qwen-4B) then 8: P \u2190P \u222a{d} \u25b7Add only samples where both models failed 9: end if 10: end for 11: Stage 2: Difficulty Consensus 12: for d \u2208P do 13: if ISHIGHDIFFICULTY(Qwen-30B) and ISHIGHDIFFICULTY(Qwen-4B) then 14: D\u2032 \u2190D\u2032 \u222a{d} \u25b7Add only samples where both models agree on high difficulty 15: end if 16: end for 17: Return: D\u2032 Language Dataset Name Synthesizer # tokens # num rows English Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v120 Qwen3-235B & DeepSeek-R1 144.75B 24.9M OpenThoughts3-1.2M21 QwQ-32B 5.46B 0.4M Korean Ko-Reasoning 10 Qwen3-235B 7.05B 5.8M Nemotron-Post-Trans GPT-oss(120B) & Qwen3-Next-80B 2.83B 1.1M English + Korean total Reasoning tokens: 157.76B Table 15: Table 15: Korean and English Datasets Used in Reasoning Mid-Training Data Filtering Algorithm 1 outlines the procedure for sampling high-difficulty Korean translation seeds from the English Nemotron-Post-V1 dataset. The process consists of two stages, each designed to assess the reasoning difficulty of the samples. 1. Non-Reasoning Sample Filtering: We first selected only the samples that were answered incorrectly by both Qwen-30B and Qwen-4B. This approach is based on the intuition that samples demanding complex reasoning are more challenging for instruction-tuned models to solve correctly. Consequently, the samples retained in this stage require detailed reasoning traces and can directly enhance reasoning capability when used for training. 2. Difficulty Consensus Filtering: From the Stage 1 candidates, only samples that both Qwen-30B and Qwen-4B labeled as high-difficulty were included in the final dataset. While prior studies have often used the length of the reasoning path as a proxy for task difficulty, 23 this metric becomes unreliable for DeepSeek-family models, which frequently incorporate self-verification steps within their reasoning traces Jung and Jung [2025], Peng et al. [2025]. Moreover, length-based bias can lead to undesirable learning behaviors, such as redundant reasoning patterns or unclear logical structures. To mitigate these issues, we instead utilize model-generated difficulty tags and retain only those samples where both models exhibit a consistent consensus on high difficulty, thereby ensuring the inclusion of truly challenging reasoning data.

Each bar represents the proportion of correct (blue) and incorrect (orange) samples within each difficulty group. For the STEM domain, correctness was determined using exact match evaluation, given the relatively simple structure of the expected answers. In contrast, for the Math domain, correctness was assessed using Qwen-4B to verify consistency between the model\u2019s output and the expected answer. Due to its narrower answer space, the STEM domain exhibits higher overall accuracy. The Code and Chat domains were excluded from the stage 1 filtering process, as objective correctness evaluation is inherently difficult in these domains. In the code domain, only 48K samples (2.5%) out of 1.90M were retained, resulting in a 97.5% reduction. The math domain decreased from 2.04M to 217K samples (11.0%), and the STEM domain from 20.66M to 196K samples (1.0%), reflecting a 99.0% reduction. Detailed difficulty distributions for math and STEM are shown in Figure 10. For the chat and tool-calling domains, difficulty-based sampling was not applied due to the absence of ground-truth labels. Based on the selected samples, we constructed the Korean dataset through the following translation procedure. To ensure diversity, we used GPT-OSS-120B and Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct in equal proportion (50% each). For the chat and code domains, since the original user queries in Nemotron were sourced from external datasets (lmsys-chat-lm, apps, code contests, open-r1/codeforces, taco), we supplemented incomplete queries using metadata prior to translation. During translation, we preserved LaTeX expressions, variable names, and function names without modification, and maintained the tone (formal/casual) and style of the original text as closely as possible. For the code domain, we adopted terminology commonly used in Korean programming com- munities. In the case of tool-calling samples, translations were conducted strictly without simulating agent behavior. 24 The resulting Korean dataset amounts to approximately 2.8B tokens, measured using tiktoken with the o200k_base vocabulary. The final dataset features multi-step reasoning processes and complex logical structures, providing a foundation for the KORMo model to internalize reasoning ability more effectively and to generalize toward advanced reasoning capabilities. For English data, we used the full dataset without additional filtering, covering the full spectrum of difficulty from simple to challenging samples. Training Details Following the proposed filtering and translation procedures, we obtained a final reasoning dataset consisting of 150B English tokens and 10B Korean tokens. Each sample was formatted to enclose the reasoning trace within the <think> and </think> tokens. During this stage, however, the <think> token was excluded from loss computation. This design choice prevents semantic interference in the subsequent SFT stage, where the model will be explicitly trained to treat the <think> token as a reasoning trigger signal.

The most significant improvement was observed at the Stage 2 phase. On average, the aggregate metrics in Table 16 improved by +4.45 pt (60.15\u219264.60) compared to Stage 1, and the reasoning-focused benchmarks in Table 17 saw a +5.05-point gain (53.74\u219258.79). These gains span a broad range of tasks, including ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, and the MMLU series, suggesting that Stage 2 contributes to enhancing the model\u2019s generalization capabilities. Impact of Long-Context Training The Midtrain(Long) stage benefited tasks such as multiple- choice QA and commonsense-based classification by exposing the model to longer contexts and narrative-style inputs. It achieved the highest scores across several benchmarks, including ARC-Easy (86.11), BoolQ (84.04), COPA (95.0), and CommonsenseQA (72.81). However, slight performance drops were observed compared to Stage 2 on more reasoning-intensive tasks such as ARC-Challenge, Winogrande, and GPQA-main. This suggests that while long-context signals may be advantageous for commonsense or surface-level patterns, they have limitations in supporting fine-grained inference or bias control. Reasoning-Oriented Transfer Learning The Midtrain(Reason) stage led to clear improvements on more challenging, reasoning-centric tasks. Benchmarks such as MMLU(67.96), Global-EN(63.44), MMLU-Pro(40.18), Redux(69.00), and GPQA-main(30.13) all achieved the highest scores in their respective columns, with Social-IQA(52.81) also showing a modest improvement. On average, the Reasoning benchmark suite saw a +1.55pt gain over Stage 2 (58.79\u219260.34), demonstrating that reasoning-intensive data signals contribute effectively to solving high-difficulty problems. While there was a slight drop in performance on certain tasks like ARC-Challenge and Winogrande, overall performance remained comparable to that of Stage 2. 25 Model click csatqa haerae k2_eval kobest kobalt kmmlu kmmlu_p kmmlu_r clinical_qa mmlu_global Avg.

Analysis Stage2 played a key role in significantly improving the overall base performance, while the subsequent Long and Reason stages provided specialized benefits: the Long stage, which exposes the model to extended contexts and narrative inputs, enhanced commonsense and contextual retrieval ability; the Reason stage, which focuses on high-difficulty reasoning tasks, strengthened precise reasoning ability. Therefore, KORMo\u2019s mid-training pipeline suggests that the most effective approach is a two-phase strategy: (1) securing broad foundational capabilities through Stage 2, (2) enhancing commonsense and contextual retrieval ability through Long, and (3) reinforcing precise reasoning ability through Reason. Additionally, since the optimal training stage may vary depending on the target task characteristics, a stage selection strategy aligned with the task domain or a multi-head tuning approach would be more effective in practical applications. Comparison of Korean Benchmark Performance As summarized in Table 18, KORMo exhibited steady improvements across Korean benchmarks as training progressed. Stage2 yielded the largest performance gain, with a +6.88pt increase in average score compared to Stage 1 (43.43\u219250.31), par- ticularly improving knowledge-based and reading comprehension tasks such as Clinical-QA(72.92), MMLU-Global(53.61), and K2-Eval(80.79). Subsequently, Midtrain(Long) yielded a modest im- provement in the average performance, with notable gains in context-dependent tasks such as Click(55.59) and Haerae(66.73). Lastly, Midtrain(Reasoning) achieved the highest overall perfor- mance with an average of 54.12, showing strong improvements on high-difficulty reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks such as KMMLU(46.48), KMMLU-Redux(37.88), Clinical-QA(77.32), and MMLU-Global(55.16). In summary, Stage 2 establishes strong foundational capabilities, Long enhances performance on context and reading comprehension tasks, and Reason maximizes high-level reasoning capabilities\u2014demonstrating a clear functional specialization across stages in the Korean training pipeline. Cross-lingual Stage-wise Comparison Interestingly, the performance trends across training stages appear similar for both Korean and English. Stage2 led to the most substantial improvement in overall foundational abilities; the Long stage provided notable gains on context-dependent tasks (e.g., ARC-Easy, BoolQ, Click, Haerae); and the Reason stage achieved the best results on challenging reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MMLU-Pro, GPQA, KMMLU, Clinical-QA). However, language-specific differences were also observed. In English, the Long stage showed clear improvements on commonsense multiple-choice QA tasks (CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA), whereas in Korean, the Reason stage led to more dramatic improvements on domain-specific QA tasks such as Clinical-QA. This suggests that, despite relatively limited training resources, the Korean model was able to reproduce a universal learning progression (Core \u2192Context \u2192Reasoning) through staged training, while also achieving language- and domain-specific improvements. Therefore, this study demonstrates that stage-wise design can serve not only to boost raw performance in non-English models but also as a fine-tuning tool to compensate for language-specific strengths and weaknesses. 6 Post-training In this section, we present the post-training procedure, the final stage of KORMo\u2019s training pipeline. This stage consists of two main components: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and a preference learning- based fine-tuning process. 26 6.1 Supervised Fine-tuning The SFT stage aims to fine-tune the language", "language-specific strengths and weaknesses. 6 Post-training In this section, we present the post-training procedure, the final stage of KORMo\u2019s training pipeline. This stage consists of two main components: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and a preference learning- based fine-tuning process. 26 6.1 Supervised Fine-tuning The SFT stage aims to fine-tune the language model so that it can faithfully understand and execute user instructions. Instead of constructing a new SFT dataset from scratch, we assembled the training data by upsampling data generated in previous stages and incorporating publicly available open- source datasets. However, as emphasized in the LIMA study [Zhou et al., 2023], the performance of SFT is highly sensitive to data quality, which necessitated a rigorous filtering process to ensure the use of high-quality data. To further structure the training, we divided the SFT stage into two phases: Base SFT, which focuses on enhancing general reasoning and language capabilities, and Instruction-Following SFT, which emphasizes consistent formatting and faithful adherence to user instructions.

Underlined datasets indicate those curated as part of this work. Together, these datasets comprise a total of 8.02B tokens. Dataset Filtering. To secure a high-quality SFT dataset, we applied the following procedures: 1. Deduplication: We collected data from the Ko-Reasoning dataset and the English Nemotron- Post-Training-Dataset-v1 (chat, code, math, and STEM subsets). Duplicate samples were removed based on the unique identifier (uuid) assigned to each query. 2. Difficulty-based Sampling: For Korean data, we employed the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct- 2507 model as an evaluator to filter out overly simple samples from the Ko-Reasoning dataset. The model solved STEM, math, and code problems, and its predictions were compared against the correct answers. Correctly answered samples were labeled as reasoning not required, while incorrect ones were labeled as reasoning required. The final dataset was balanced at a 1:1 ratio between the two categories. For English data, we sampled from the easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels defined in Figure 10, maintaining a balanced distribution across levels. 3. Length Filtering: To comply with the model\u2019s maximum input length, samples with total sequences exceeding 16,384 tokens were excluded. 27 Additionally, to ensure broader conversational and functional coverage beyond single-turn question answering, we incorporated data related to multi-turn dialogues, tool calling, and linguistic diversity from HuggingFaceTB/smoltalk2. BASE SFT Training Strategy. Based on the final dataset, we performed SFT for one epoch to train two model variants: 1. Reasoning-Enhanced Model: This variant is designed to explicitly perform reasoning for all queries. During loss computation, all subsequent tokens\u2014including the reasoning span between the <think> and </think> tokens\u2014were included in the training targets. This setup allows the model to internalize not only the generation of the final answer but also the logical reasoning process leading to it. 2. Hybrid Model: This variant allows users to toggle between reasoning and non-reasoning modes. In reasoning mode, the <think> block contains an explicit reasoning trace, while in non-reasoning mode, an empty reasoning block (\u201c<think>\\n\\n</think>\u201d) was intention- ally inserted during training. Following the previously described difficulty-based sampling strategy, easy samples were assigned to non-reasoning mode and difficult ones to reasoning mode, maintaining a balanced 1:1 ratio overall. Instruction-Following SFT Training Strategy. In this stage, the model was further fine-tuned to enhance its ability to follow user instructions faithfully and to produce well-structured, contextually consistent responses. The training primarily focused on three aspects: (1) multi-turn dialogue coher- ence, (2) instruction compliance, and (3) formatting consistency. To achieve this, we constructed instruction-style prompts that required the model to maintain conversational context across turns, interpret and execute user commands accurately, and generate outputs that conformed to predefined response formats (e.g., lists, JSON, Markdown, or structured text). Compared to the Base SFT phase, which emphasized reasoning and general linguistic capability, this stage aimed to refine the model\u2019s adherence to task-specific conventions and output structures, thereby improving its usability in real-world interactive scenarios.

Compared to the Base SFT phase, which emphasized reasoning and general linguistic capability, this stage aimed to refine the model\u2019s adherence to task-specific conventions and output structures, thereby improving its usability in real-world interactive scenarios. During data construction for this phase, particular emphasis was placed on incorporating multi-turn interactions and explicit reasoning paths. For Korean data, English queries were first translated into Korean using the Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B model. The translated Korean queries were then re-instructed to the same model to generate corresponding responses, ensuring natural linguistic alignment between queries and answers. To build coherent multi-turn conversations, we adopted the Magpie [Xu et al., 2024] methodology, in which the model-generated responses were combined with the <user> turn tokens to form extended query-response sequences. In addition, to elicit reasoning traces in Korean, a language-specific signal token was inserted at the beginning of the reasoning span, which guided the model to generate reasoning paths entirely in Korean. 6.2 Optimization on Preference Learning We constructed two preference learning datasets based on the APO and ORPO frameworks to enhance KORMo\u2019s mathematical and reasoning capabilities. For APO, we used prompts from the Nemotron- Post-Train-V2 dataset to generate responses with Qwen3 models of various sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B, 30B-A3B, and 80B-A3B). Following the SmolLM3 strategy, we treated smaller model outputs as rejected samples and larger model outputs as chosen. Using 100K prompts spanning four domains (chat, STEM, code, and math) we produced 100K responses per model size. Due to GPU constraints, we constructed the dataset without proceeding to model training; training and evaluation results will be released in future work. 7 Experiments In the preceding sections, we evaluated the experiments and performance at each stage. This chapter reports on the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed method based on a more comprehensive evaluation and compares it with other external models. 28 7.1 Experiment settings Applied Models As a hybrid model, KORMo can function in two distinct modes: reasoning and non-reasoning. We performed the evaluation in the non-reasoning mode to maintain consistency with the benchmark models, which operate in a non-reasoning capacity. The reasoning mode\u2019s abilities must be strengthened through reinforcement learning, and accordingly, an assessment of the enhanced model will be presented in subsequent work. Benchmarks To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the KORMo model, we utilized a total of over 26 benchmarks for both English and Korean, covering the domains of reasoning, knowledge, and domain-specific tasks (Table 20). First, in the English General Reasoning category, we evaluate logical reasoning and commonsense inference capabilities using AGIEval, ARC-Challenge/Easy, BoolQ, CommonSenseQA, COPA, HellaSwag, PIQA, Social-IQA, WinoGrande, and OpenBookQA. The English Knowledge & Exam-based category focuses on assessing domain-specific and academic problem-solving skills using MMLU and its extended variants\u2014MMLU-Global, MMLU-Pro, and MMLU-Redux\u2014along with GPQA-Main, which measures performance on advanced scientific questions. For Korean General Reasoning, we employ recently released Korean benchmarks such as CLICK, CSATQA, HAERAE, K2Eval, KoBEST, and KoBALT to measure cultural and linguistic adaptability of the models. Finally, the Korean Knowledge & Domain-specific evaluation includes KMMLU, KMMLU-Pro, KMMLU-Redux, KR-Clinical-QA, and", "with GPQA-Main, which measures performance on advanced scientific questions. For Korean General Reasoning, we employ recently released Korean benchmarks such as CLICK, CSATQA, HAERAE, K2Eval, KoBEST, and KoBALT to measure cultural and linguistic adaptability of the models. Finally, the Korean Knowledge & Domain-specific evaluation includes KMMLU, KMMLU-Pro, KMMLU-Redux, KR-Clinical-QA, and MMLU-Global (KR). These benchmarks assess the models\u2019 ability to comprehend and respond to Korean-domain expert questions in fields such as medicine and law. Among them, KR-Clinical-QA is the most recently released benchmark and is included to mitigate potential data contamination that might occur with earlier public datasets, ensuring a more objective measurement of model performance. All benchmarks are evaluated under a 5-shot prompting setup (4-shot for GPQA-Main), and accuracy is used as the unified evaluation metric. This configuration aims to verify whether KORMo achieves balanced reasoning and knowledge competence across multilingual and multi-domain environments. Lastly, for the instruction-tuned models, we evaluate models that have undergone the same in- struction tuning procedure. To assess instruction-following ability, we use three representative LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks, where GPT-4o serves as a consistent evaluation model for all systems. Evaluation Prompt We adopted the standard evaluation prompts proposed by OLMo 2 (as shown in Table 20). To assess instruction-following capabilities, we evaluated all models under the same conditions using GPT-4o and the same set of prompts. prompt MMLU Q: {question} Put your answer within \\boxed{}. Figure 11: Prompt for evaluating MMLU 7.2 Base Model Evaluation The evaluation of base models aims to assess the foundational capabilities of language understanding, reasoning, and mathematical skills prior to instruction tuning. Accordingly, we compare only the base versions of models, without any instruction tuning applied, to ensure a fair evaluation. Among recently released multilingual models, only Qwen3, Gemma3, and LLaMA3.1 offer publicly available base versions. For Korean, Kanana1.5 is the sole model with a base release. Thus, this evaluation is designed to isolate the effects of pretraining, excluding any influence from instruction tuning or RLHF. Meanwhile, Fully-Open Model(FOMs) such as SmolLM3 and OLMo2 also release base versions; however, these are primarily trained on English and other Indo-European languages. 29 Name Language Prompting Metric General Reasoning (English) AGIEval Zhong et al.

Each benchmark is categorized by domain and language, with its prompting setup (shot) and evaluation metric. Overall Trends When evaluated in its base form (before instruction tuning), KORMo-10B scored 64.2 on English and 58.2 on Korean benchmarks. This indicates stable performance compared to other models in the Fully-Open category. In English, it performed on par with large open models such as OLMo2-13B (64.2 vs. 65.3), while in Korean, it scored approximately 4\u20138% lower than multilingual LLMs including KANANA-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemma3-12B. Given its relatively modest pretraining corpus of 2.9T tokens, these results highlight KORMo-10B\u2019s high language modeling efficiency. English Benchmarks: Robust Reasoning Ability KORMo consistently demonstrated strong performance in general reasoning (ARC, BoolQ, HellaSwag) and commonsense inference tasks (PIQA, Social-IQA, WinoGrande). While larger 12B and 13B models generally achieved higher scores, the margin was relatively narrow (2\u20137%). KORMo also consistently outperformed other mid-sized fully open models. This suggests that KORMo was able to acquire the essential patterns of English reasoning, even without exposure to the wide domain coverage typically seen in large multilingual models. On the other hand, it showed slightly lower performance on more knowledge- intensive tasks such as MMLU-Pro and GPQA, suggesting that KORMo\u2019s strength lies more in general reasoning and linguistic consistency than in fine-grained factual precision.

Eval, a general-purpose Korean reasoning task. This suggests that the quality of Korean data and its proportion in pretraining were effective. However, performance was relatively lower on tasks like KOBALT, which require fine-grained lexical and semantic discrimination. This suggests that additional post-training may be necessary to better capture subtle linguistic distinctions. We also observed that Korean performance generally improved with a higher proportion of Korean data. Compared to the KANANA-1.5 model, KORMo scored 1.84 points higher in English, but 2.79 points lower in Korean. Considering that KANANA reportedly uses approximately 10% Korean data, this result reflects the effect of KORMo\u2019s lower Korean data ratio, estimated at around 5.6%. Korean Knowledge & Domain Tasks: Specialized Strengths On the Clinical-QA benchmark, which focuses on domain-specific knowledge, KORMo showed notable strength in clinical and practical tasks. This suggests that the model effectively internalized medical and commonsense data presented in real-world QA formats during training. On the other hand, in the KMMLU suite, which focuses on academic and advanced knowledge-based tasks, KORMo showed weaker performance than large multilingual models. This indicates a pretraining bias toward general reasoning rather than fine-grained domain-specific knowledge. The result also implies a lack of exposure to high-quality expert data or explanatory QA formats, likely due to limitations in generating advanced professional content within the augmented Korean datasets. Cross-lingual Patterns and Efficiency The average score gap between English and Korean for KORMo was around 6 points, demonstrating a level of balance comparable to large-scale multilingual models such as Qwen and Gemma. While KANANA, which is optimized for Korean, showed a much smaller gap of about 1 point, its English performance was relatively limited.

This outcome underscores the effectiveness of our data design, enabled by fine-grained control over bilingual proportions within a limited token budget.

In contrast, we observe relative weaknesses on (a) high-difficulty spe- cialist knowledge benchmarks (e.g., MMLU-Pro, the KMMLU family) and (b) lexical semantic discrimination tasks (e.g., KOBALT), which remain targets for improvement. To address these gaps, we plan to explore (i) high-quality, domain-knowledge\u2013oriented mid-training, (ii) Korean-centric contrastive fine-tuning, and (iii) post-training strategies that incorporate diverse supervision formats (e.g., explanatory QA and chain-of-thought). Overall, our results provide empirical evidence that, for LLMs, data quality and linguistic balance matter more than sheer token volume in determining generality and efficiency. 7.3 Evaluation of SFT Models We believe KORMo was trained on a larger volume of Korean instruction data than any of the models it is compared against. This was a deliberate design decision, as we focused on the model\u2019s capability to respond suitably to various Korean instructions instead of performing well on MMLU- style multiple-choice questions. Our focus was on enhancing the practical, real-world performance as perceived by users. Experimental Setup and Preliminary The present experiment was conducted with models limited to those that have completed only the instruction tuning stage. This means we are comparing their linguistic and instruction execution capabilities prior to any further reasoning enhancement via reinforcement learning (such as RLHF, GRPO, or APO). Such a configuration is intended to assess a model\u2019s capacity for generating natural and coherent responses based solely on supervised data. The selected benchmarks (MT-Bench, KO-MT-Bench, and Logickor) encompass tasks focused on general dialogue, Korean-specific dialogue, and logical inference, respectively, and collectively reflect the models\u2019 linguistic fluency, fidelity to instructions, and logical coherence.

Instruction Following Ability (MT-Bench). MT-Bench and LogicKor serve as multi-domain benchmarks for evaluating instruction-following capabilities in English and Korean, designed to offer a holistic assessment of response quality and consistency in instruction-tuned models. The results of our comparative analysis of mean scores reveal that KORMo-10B achieved the highest average score (8.61). This places its performance in close equivalence to commercial-grade models like Gemma3-12B (8.56) and Qwen3-8B (8.50). Such a result suggests that KORMo successfully captured the expressiveness and structural variety of the instruction corpus despite being trained with comparatively fewer tokens (2.9T) and resources. The Effect of Language Distribution in Instruction Tuning Data on Model Efficiency. When comparing the mean scores for English (MT-Bench) against Korean benchmarks (KO-MT-Bench, Logickor), KORMo demonstrates superior capability in Korean, achieving an average score of 8.75, in contrast to 8.32 for English. This finding indicates that KORMo has thoroughly incorporated its Korean-focused instruction fine-tuning dataset. We infer that this is because KORMo was trained on a more substantial amount of Korean instruction data than the other models under consideration. Conclusion. First, KORMo achieved performance similar to large multilingual models in an instruction-only setup, which we credit to effectively using data quality and instructional diversity. Second, the KO-MT-Bench and Logickor benchmarks show that KORMo demonstrates greater 32 robustness in Korean conversational contexts and logical inference tasks. Third, achieving an 8.6 MT-Bench score without reinforcement learning suggests that instruction tuning alone is enough for understanding user instructions and generating clear, logical responses. Finally, the main advantage of KORMo is not just its multilingual ability, but its effective knowledge alignment through high-quality bilingual instruction fine-tuning. For the subsequent reinforcement learning stage, our objective is to expand upon this base by extending reasoning chains and reinforcing multi-hop consistency, thus transitioning the model from its instruction-tuned capabilities to those of a reasoning-capable agent. 7.4 Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Models As a final step, we will further strengthen the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities by incorporating mathematics and logical reasoning data generated using our previously introduced, custom-developed APO and GRPO frameworks. 8 Conclusion This paper introduced KORMo, the first fully open bilingual Korean-English LLM developed primarily with synthetic data. Through extensive quantitative analysis, we demonstrated that synthetic corpora can effectively replace large-scale human-curated data when designed with careful linguistic balance and stylistic diversity. Across both pretraining and instruction-tuning stages, KORMo exhibits stable convergence, strong multilingual generalization, and high reasoning consistency-comparable to leading open-weight models considering the small number of trained tokens. Empirical evaluation across over various benchmarks revealed several key insights. First, KO- RMo maintains competitive English reasoning ability while achieving superior Korean instruction- following and logical coherence. Second, task-specific results (e.g., KR-Clinical-QA, Logickor) highlight the complementary strengths of synthetic data: efficiency in generalized reasoning, yet room for improvement in fine-grained expert knowledge. Third, the language mixture and tokenizer analy- ses confirm that balanced bilingual compression improves token efficiency and stability, providing a replicable guideline for future FOM builders.", "task-specific results (e.g., KR-Clinical-QA, Logickor) highlight the complementary strengths of synthetic data: efficiency in generalized reasoning, yet room for improvement in fine-grained expert knowledge. Third, the language mixture and tokenizer analy- ses confirm that balanced bilingual compression improves token efficiency and stability, providing a replicable guideline for future FOM builders. Importantly, KORMo validates that synthetic data is not only viable but also scalable as a principal resource for non-English FOMs. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that synthetic augmentation leads to model collapse or cultural drift. Instead, with transparent preprocessing, curriculum control, and open evaluation, synthetic data can serve as a sustainable foundation for reproducible multilingual research. In conclusion, KORMo bridges the gap between open-weight multilingual models and fully open, reproducible pipelines. By publicly releasing the entire data and training process, it enables the community to extend and audit every component of the LLM lifecycle. Future work will expand upon this foundation by (i) incorporating reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning, (ii) exploring multilingual generalization beyond Korean\u2013English, and (iii) establishing standardized evaluation suites for synthetic-data\u2013driven language modeling. Through this effort, KORMo aims to advance the broader movement toward transparent, reproducible, and inclusive foundation model research. Acknowledgments Special Thanks.

However, large- scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content writ- ten by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives.

To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Inves- tigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset. Our code and data are publicly available1.

Introduction Today, traffic crashes remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with an estimated 1.19 million fatalities annually [1]. Improving road safety is therefore a critical global challenge. A key approach is through analyzing high quality real-world data recorded in crash databases [2, 3]. Data is typi- cally documented by crash investigators as part of official reports and usually contains information about the crash, those involved, crash severity outcomes (i.e., injuries or fatalities), and crash narratives. Among these records, crash narratives are especially valuable, as they include actual descriptions of the crash that go beyond structured variables, such as vehicle travel directions, impact points, and other contextual factors [4]. Despite their value, crash narratives are currently limited to smaller case studies. They are typically written in unstructured text with highly diverse writing styles, inconsistent terminology, and varying levels", "descriptions of the crash that go beyond structured variables, such as vehicle travel directions, impact points, and other contextual factors [4]. Despite their value, crash narratives are currently limited to smaller case studies. They are typically written in unstructured text with highly diverse writing styles, inconsistent terminology, and varying levels of detail. As a result, these narratives cannot be readily batch-processed using conventional statistical techniques. Investi- gators have traditionally addressed this by manually preprocessing the text into structured formats such as tables for statistical analysis. This process is not only labor-intensive but also error-prone, especially when working with large datasets. To reduce this burden, researchers have increasingly explored natural lan- guage processing (NLP) to automate parts of the pipeline. Early approaches relied on topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA [5]), Term 1https://github.com/hiXixi66/PLMs-Crash-Narrative-Analysis 2 Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [6] keyword weighting, or bag-of-words (BoW) [7] classifiers. While useful for coarse crash classifica- tion, these methods process each word separately and cannot capture sen- tence structure or nuanced semantics in a crash narrative. Word embedding methods improved semantic representation by mapping words to vectors, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) further advanced sequence modeling by learning from data. In practice, these techniques provide only shallow seman- tic cues, which can extract explicit information from narratives but remain insufficient for complex crash narratives where multiple vehicles are refer- enced in a single text description which might include crash causal links. For example, collision type is an essential factor in crash analysis, but it can only be determined through in-depth interpretation of a crash narrative. Extract- ing the Crash Type for each vehicle is even more challenging. In multi-vehicle crashes, the crash report is often written as a single narrative where descrip- tions of different vehicles are intertwined and sometimes causally related. In such cases, models must accurately identify the target vehicle and make de- cisions based on its context without being distracted by irrelevant textual information, a capability that the previously mentioned models struggle to provide. Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), like Bidirec- tional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [8] and Large Language Models (LLMs), provide better solutions [9]. By pre-training on large-scale corpora, models learn to capture rich semantic representations, thereby gaining powerful sentence understanding capabilities. BERT is suit- able for classification tasks because its pre-training on masked language mod- eling, but it relies on patterns learned from training data, without considering the semantic meaning of categories or incorporating any oracle knowledge. In contrast, LLMs can exploit such knowledge, and techniques like prompt engineering, chain-of-thought (CoT) [10] prompting, and few-shot learning are widely used to further enhance their performance. Yet, despite their strong capabilities, applying PLMs to crash narrative analysis faces several challenges. First, the use of external APIs may in- troduce data security and privacy risks, as sensitive crash reports cannot always be shared with third-party services. Second, deploying and running large-scale models requires substantial computational resources, making both training and inference costly. Finally, PLMs have shown limited adaptability to traffic safety domains because their training corpora typically lack suffi- cient specific knowledge", "and privacy risks, as sensitive crash reports cannot always be shared with third-party services. Second, deploying and running large-scale models requires substantial computational resources, making both training and inference costly. Finally, PLMs have shown limited adaptability to traffic safety domains because their training corpora typically lack suffi- cient specific knowledge related to traffic. 3 Considering all the above, we applied fine-tuned open-source PLMs on domain-specific data to achieve inference-intensive traffic crash information extraction. Here, we reformulate the information extraction from narratives problem as a structured classification task. For straightforward classification (e.g., per-crash Manner of Collision extraction), we fine-tune compact PLMs (e.g., BERT) on crash data to focus on safety-critical cues in narratives. For the more complex task (e.g., per-vehicle Crash Type extraction), we use an instruction-following LLM and inject oracle knowledge (e.g., its possible cat- egory set) directly into the prompt, ensuring predictions are consistent with dataset coding rules. To mitigate data quality and quantity requirements, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [11] to parameters-efficiently adapt of the open-source LLMs. We evaluate our approach on the Crash Investiga- tion Sampling System (CISS) dataset released by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [12], comparing the results against GPT models, BERT, and seven LLM backbones as baselines. Our contributions are threefold: \u2022 First, we formulate crash-narrative understanding as a structured clas- sification problem and demonstrate that domain-adapted PLMs can effectively solve it. \u2022 Second, we enable constraint-aware, fine-grained Crash Type classifi- cation by instruction-tuning LLMs to explicitly respect label-space re- strictions imposed by upstream category and configuration choices. \u2022 Finally, we provide a comprehensive empirical study on CISS, showing state-of-the-art performance, data efficiency, and robustness. 2. Related work 2.1. Traditional text-analysis methods Research on crash narrative analysis typically follows a two-stage pipeline. First extracting text features (e.g., frequencies, topics, embeddings) and then applying classification models. Early work relied on frequency-based repre- sentations. BoW [7] treats a text as an unordered collection of words and encodes text as simple word counts or TF-IDF values. These representations are typically paired with traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes [13], Lo- gistic Regression [13, 14], and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [15]. Such models have been used, for example, to identify agricultural crashes [16] and 4 secondary crashes [17]. However, BoW and TF-IDF only reflect surface-level word frequency statistics and fail to capture the latent semantic structure of documents. To incorporate semantic themes, researchers adopted topic mod- eling. Methods such as LDA learn latent topics from text and represent each narrative as a probability distribution over these topics. Some studies have applied topic modeling to summarize themes in travel surveys [18, 19], to study motorcycle crash causation [20], to analyze the relationships between latent topics and crash severity [21], and to examine safety concerns associ- ated with transitions of control in autonomous vehicle crash narratives [22]. crashes [22]. Yet, topic models remain coarse-grained, providing only dis- tributions over topic words and lacking detailed semantic understanding. With the rise of word embeddings, text representation have advanced be- yond sparse counts. Techniques such as Word2Vec [23] and GloVe [24] project", "of control in autonomous vehicle crash narratives [22]. crashes [22]. Yet, topic models remain coarse-grained, providing only dis- tributions over topic words and lacking detailed semantic understanding. With the rise of word embeddings, text representation have advanced be- yond sparse counts. Techniques such as Word2Vec [23] and GloVe [24] project words into continuous low-dimensional spaces, capturing semantic and syn- tactic similarities. When integrated with downstream classifiers, these em- beddings have been used for traffic text classification to detect emerging risks [25] or for transportation sentiment analysis [26]. To further improve performance, neural networks such as CNNs [27] and RNNs [28] have been employed as advanced downstream classifiers following word embeddings. For example, some researchers used them in railway accident cause analy- sis [28], road crash cause analysis [29], and injury outcomes investigation of Horse-and-Buggy crashes in rural areas [30]. The above methods decouple text representation from classification, per- forming feature extraction and task learning independently, preventing gra- dients from back-propagating through the entire model during training. As a result, the text representations cannot be optimized for the specific task, which limits the model\u2019s overall performance. Recent research has shifted toward unified models that integrate text representation and downstream task learning in an end-to-end manner. For instance, some studies learn richer semantic features for identifying accident causes [31] or performing traffic classification [32]. However, RNNs still suffer from gradient vanishing and gradient exploding problems, which restrict layer stacking beyond a few layers and limit their ability to capture complex semantics. 2.2. PLM-based text-analysis methods With the rise of Transformer architectures, model stacking is no longer a limitation, and model parameters can and have scaled to billions. This scaling 5 has significantly enhanced model capacity, enabling the use of large-scale pre- training on massive corpora to capture contextual semantic representations. For example, BERT has been applied to identify actual wrong-way driving (WWD) crashes [33], to classify traffic injury types into five categories [34], and to extract impact points and pre-collision vehicle maneuvers [35]. How- ever, BERT is pre-trained with masked language modeling and designed for classification instead of prompt-driven generation, so it cannot directly in- terpret and respond to prompts, limiting its applicability in crash narrative analysis. In contrast, prompt-based LLMs can naturally incorporate task instruc- tions into the input, making them more flexible for classification and rea- soning over unstructured crash narratives. Mumtarin et al. [36] evaluated LLMs in answering safety question tasks from accident narratives by em- bedding questions directly into prompts. Arteaga and Park [37] employed prompt engineering to identify unreported alcohol involvement in crash re- ports. Zhen et al. [38] further leveraged CoT [10] reasoning and prompt en- gineering with LLMs to enhance traffic crash severity analysis and inference. To address the limited adaptability of PLMs caused by insufficient domain- specific knowledge in their training corpora, fine-tuning Transformer-based models provides an effective solution. For example, Jaradat et al. [39] pro- posed a multi-task learning (MTL) LLM framework, and Golshan et al. [40] fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1 model to extract crash locations and casualty counts, with both approaches achieving high accuracy.", "specific knowledge in their training corpora, fine-tuning Transformer-based models provides an effective solution.

[40] fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1 model to extract crash locations and casualty counts, with both approaches achieving high accuracy. Overall, these studies focus on simple tasks with few categories or infor- mation explicitly stated in the narratives, leaving their effectiveness on more complex problems unknown. 3. Methodology PLMs are effective for text classification, converting unstructured crash narratives into structured fields [41]. While recent traffic-safety studies can extract explicitly stated details [42], reasoning-intensive variables remain challenging due to limited crash-specific knowledge and the prohibitive cost of full-model training. We address this by adopting parameter-efficient fine- tuning on BERT and with LoRA [11] on LLMs using an annotated crash dataset, injecting domain knowledge at low compute and memory cost and enabling safer, more controllable deployment than closed LLMs via public APIs. Our work targets two high-value variables that support crash risk 6 assessment, and countermeasure design: (i) Manner of Collision, a reason- ing task over event sequences and interacting agents; and (ii) Crash Type, a fine-grained classification with 98 possible classes. We now begin by de- scribing the data used in our approach, defining our problem more clearly for both tasks, and presenting our fine-tuning to extract information from crash narratives. 3.1. Dataset: CISS This paper uses the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) dataset released by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [12] as a case study. CISS is a national traffic crash database which provides comprehensive traffic crash data on police-reported motor vehicle crashes occurring in the United States involving passenger cars, light trucks, and light vans that were towed [43]. It retrospectively investigated traffic crash records collected from 2017 to 2023, of approximately 3,700 cases per year. The database contains about 39 relational tables2, each describing a spe- cific aspect of the crash, such as crash level data (table CRASH), events level record (table EVENT), general vehicle record (table GV). CISS includes not only SUMMARY (a basic description of the crash scenario as documented by the crash investigator), but also structured case coding such as MANCOLL (man- ner of collision) and CRASHTYPE (crash type), which are basically manually determined [44]. In the CISS dataset, MANCOLL is not directly annotated but rather derived through rule-based mapping from other manually labeled variables, including OBJECT CONTACTED in table EVENT as well as CRASHTYPE and TRANSPORT in table GV. The resulting classification consists of seven categories as shown in Table 1, one of which corresponds to unknown. The CRASHTYPE is a numeric value derived through a two-step process: first by selecting the crash category (CRASHCAT) and crash configuration (CRASHCONF) in the GV table (as illustrated in Figure 1), and then by the crash investigator\u2019s assessment based on police reports, scene inspections, vehicle inspections, and interviews. This two-step procedure is preferred be- cause it provides a more structured and interpretable way to visualize crash scenarios. 2The number and columns of tables in CISS continuously", "(as illustrated in Figure 1), and then by the crash investigator\u2019s assessment based on police reports, scene inspections, vehicle inspections, and interviews. This two-step procedure is preferred be- cause it provides a more structured and interpretable way to visualize crash scenarios. 2The number and columns of tables in CISS continuously changes as the data-collection process is updated. For instance, the dataset of year 2017 did not include the VPICDECODE table. 7 Table 1: Class definitions for the MANCOLL task.

Problem definition This paper uses the CISS dataset as a case study to evaluate BERT and LLMs on extracting information that requires deep inference from unstruc- tured text. We focus on analyzing the crash narratives (the SUMMARY column in the CRASH table) to infer structured collision-type information. Specifi- cally, our goal is (1) to identify the Manner of Collision for each crash and (2) the Crash Type for all vehicles involved in a crash. For the first task, we are interested in assigning the Manner of Collision based solely on the textual description of the crash (i.e., SUMMARY column in the CRASH table), without using any structured metadata. It requires deep-reasoning beyond explicitly stated facts. We use the MANCOLL column in CRASH as ground truth labels for accuracy evaluation. For the second task, we want to extract the Crash Type for each vehicle in a crash. Unlike MANCOLL, which involves only seven classes, CRASHTYPE is considerably more challenging, encompassing 97 fine-grained categories. To make this problem more tractable, we exploit the hierarchical mapping illus- trated in Figure 1 and decompose the task into 13 smaller classification sub- 8 tasks based on CRASHCONF. All subtasks are addressed within a single model. Since CRASHCAT and CRASHCONF classifications are relatively straightforward3, we treat CRASHCONF as oracle knowledge and concentrate our analysis on the more difficult CRASHTYPE classification. 3.3. LLM Fine-tuning Workflow As mentioned before, we formulate the information extraction task as a classification problem by prompting the LLM to output a predefined la- bel rather than free-form text and focus on per-crash Manner of Collision and per-vehicle Crash Type extraction tasks. We now outline the detailed processes of the two tasks, followed by the supervised fine-tuning process. The information extraction and reasoning tasks involved in this paper are shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, MANCOLL directly determines the overall collision mode from the entire crash narrative. The output", "extraction tasks. We now outline the detailed processes of the two tasks, followed by the supervised fine-tuning process. The information extraction and reasoning tasks involved in this paper are shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, MANCOLL directly determines the overall collision mode from the entire crash narrative. The output space is relatively small (7 classes) and can be completed using a fixed CoT prompt. CRASHTYPE extraction for each vehicle, in Figure 2b, requires first identifying the target vehicle (V1/V2/V3) within a text containing multiple vehicle information intertwined. Based on its crash configuration identifier (CRASHCONF), the corresponding subtask is selected from 13 different dictionaries, and the cor- responding 98 Crash Types are output. In contrast, CRASHTYPE classification not only involves entity and reference resolution, but also requires discrimi- nation within a heterogeneous and larger label space. The prompts must also be dynamically constructed rather than fixed. Therefore, it is significantly more difficult to understand than Task 1. To adapt LLMs to traffic-safety tasks, we fine-tune open-source models following the pipeline in Figure 3. During fine-tuning, we first construct prompt\u2013answer training pairs using the prompts generated in Figure 2 and the labels from CISS. We then insert LoRA adapters and apply parameter- efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to train only the adapters, reducing computa- tional overhead and speeding up training. Finally, we obtain the fine-tuned model for inference by merging the trained adapter weights with the base model\u2019s pre-trained weights. 3The CRASHCAT classification is very similar to MANCOLL, consisting of only six categories. After completing the first task, we found the two tasks highly overlapping and therefore did not pursue CRASHCAT further. The CRASHCONF categories are derived from CRASHCAT, with each CRASHCAT corresponding to only 1\u20133 CRASHCONF classes, making it a relatively simple classification task as well. 9 Format CoT prompt Crash narrative: SUMMARY(V1,V2,V3) Possible classes: \u20261: \"Rear-End\", 2: \"Head-On\", \u2026 Fixed prompt part.

(b) Per-vehicle Crash Type extracted from an intertwined multi-vehicle narrative, using 13 task-specific prompts to predict among 98 fine-grained classes. Prompt engineering The prompt is crucial for LLM performance, as small changes in wording can greatly affect accuracy. For crash-narrative analysis, prompts must em- bed traffic safety knowledge to ensure reliable predictions. Accordingly, we design a structured CoT prompt with clearly separated variable slots and a fixed instruction block (Figure 2): (i) Crash narrative: SUMMARY(V1,V2,V3); (ii) Target vehicle: Vehicle ID (used for CRASHTYPE); (iii) Possible classes: fixed small set for MANCOLL, but dictionary-specific for CRASHTYPE; and (iv) a fixed prompt part, which steers the model to understand the task, reason step-by-step, and produce constrained outputs. The prompt contains mainly the following components: 10 Supervised Fine-tuning Train LoRA (freeze base) Pre-trained LLM Prompt-answer Pair Generation Prompt engineering SUMMARY in CISS Label in CISS Prompt-answer combine Fine-tuned LLM Insert LoRA adapter Prompt-answer Pair Figure 3: Overview of the proposed LoRA-based fine-tuning framework.

You are a helpful assistant that classifies vehicle collisions into one of the following categories based on... < Possible classes and their definitions > (2) Clarification Rules. These clarification rules are derived from domain- specific heuristics, codified through expert consultation and data observation. We first enhance model performance by applying a CoT strategy. Specifically, the prompts are designed to decompose complex reasoning tasks into step-by- step subproblems, thereby guiding the LLM to follow an explicit reasoning trajectory before arriving at the final categorical prediction. Other rules were distilled from empirical insights obtained via manual inspection and a pilot study over some training examples. For the MANCOLL task, this portion of the prompt is fixed, while for the CRASHTYPE task, it is dictionary-specific and thus varies across subtasks. (3) Output Instruction. LLMs may produce varied outputs even when the classification result is correct, e.g., returning \u201d4\u201d, \u201dangle\u201d, or \u201dangled side impact\u201d for the same class. Such variations hinder batch processing. To avoid this, we use fixed prompt and explicitly instruct the model to output only a valid class index from the predefined label space.

However, traffic-domain narra- tives (e.g., crash reports, incident logs, work-zone descriptions) are underrep- resented in such corpora, so pre-trained LLMs struggle to capture domain- specific entities, relations, and causal patterns critical for crash narrative analysis. To bridge this gap efficiently, we adopt parameter-efficient fine- tuning by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and learning lightweight adapters specialized for crash narratives analysis. Self-Attention Primer (Where Adaptation Can Act). Given a token sequence represented by hidden states X \u2208RT\u00d7d, a single attention head computes Q = XWQ, K = XWK, V = XWV , where Q, K, V denote the query, key, and value representations obtained through the projection matrices WQ, WK, and WV , respectively. The atten- tion output is Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax \u0012QK\u22a4 \u221a k \u0013 V, (1) This decomposition exposes three linear projections, WQ, WK, WV , as natural adaptation points. For traffic narratives, adjusting these projections helps 12 the model aligns with crash-specific cues, and emphasize values relevant to causality. LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Domain Adaptation. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [11] inserts trainable low-rank matrices into selected frozen projec- tions so that only a small number of parameters are updated. A comparison between the original LLM and the LoRA fine-tuned LLM is illustrated in Figure 4. For the same input, the original model fails to produce the correct answer, whereas the fine-tuned model adapts the LLM\u2019s original weights W by adding the product of low-rank matrices A and B, which alters the label prediction probabilities and enables the correct output. Specifically, for a target weight W \u2208Rd\u00d7k (e.g., one of WQ, WK or WV ), LoRA learns a low-rank update \u2206W = \u03b1 r AB, A \u2208Rd\u00d7r, B \u2208Rr\u00d7k, r \u226amin(d, k), and uses the adapted weight W \u2032 = W + \u2206W (2) During fine-tuning, the large pretrained W is frozen and only A, B are trained. This reduces trainable parameters from d\u00d7k to (d+k)r and lowers memory cost, while preserving general linguistic competence. Crucially, be- cause attention is factorized", "k), and uses the adapted weight W \u2032 = W + \u2206W (2) During fine-tuning, the large pretrained W is frozen and only A, B are trained. This reduces trainable parameters from d\u00d7k to (d+k)r and lowers memory cost, while preserving general linguistic competence. Crucially, be- cause attention is factorized into Q, K, V , placing LoRA on WQ/WK directly modulates the attention weights in Equation (1), enabling the model to learn traffic-specific matching patterns; placing LoRA on WV refines content ag- gregation and readout, improving how incident attributes and causal chains are represented downstream. In our implementation, we apply LoRA to all the query, value projection layers, and key projection layers (WQ, WK and WV ) of the transformer blocks, which are empirically found to be effective for language modeling tasks [45]. Loss function. In our tasks, each crash or vehicle is assigned a label corre- sponding to the predefined classes. To simplify the output, we encode all class labels as single-token numeric identifiers using a dictionary mapping, such as in Table 1. Consequently, the model is trained to generate a single token representing the class ID for each input. We adopt the standard cross-entropy loss for training because it directly measures the divergence between the predicted probability distribution over 13 the vocabulary and the one-hot target distribution [46], thereby encouraging the model to assign maximal probability to the correct class token. For- mally, let x denote the input sequence (i.e., the crash summary), and let y \u2208{0, 1, ..., k} be the target class index, where k is the total number of classes. At the final decoding step, the LLM outputs a vocabulary-sized logit vector z \u2208R|V |. The probability of generating the target class token is computed via the softmax function: P(y | x) = exp(zy) P|V | i=1 exp(zi) (3) The training objective is to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the correct class token, which corresponds to the standard cross-entropy loss: LCE = \u2212log P(y | x) = \u2212log exp(zy) P|V | i=1 exp(zi) ! (4) 3.4. BERT Fine-tuning To adapt BERT for classification tasks, a linear layer is added on top of the BERT encoder. Specifically, the hidden representation of the special [CLS] token is used as the sentence embedding h[CLS]. The prediction is obtained as \u02c6y = softmax(W \u00b7 h[CLS] + b), (5) where W and b are trainable parameters of the linear classifier. During fine-tuning, the objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between \u02c6y and the ground-truth label, identical to the loss function used as LLM fine- tuning in Section 3.3. Importantly, all parameters of BERT together with the classification layer are updated end-to-end, enabling the model to learn task- specific knowledge while retaining its pretrained linguistic representations. 4. Experiments 4.1. Experimental Settings Backbones and baselines We evaluated BERT and multiple LLMs on the classification task under different fine-tuning configurations. The back- bone PLMs include several frontier open-source families: BERT [8], LLaMA3 series [47] (LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3.2-3B, LLaMA3.1-8B, LLaMA3.3-70B), 14 Qwen series [48] (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), and Mistral series [49] (Mistral-7B- Instruct-v0.3). We also evaluated the closed", "and baselines We evaluated BERT and multiple LLMs on the classification task under different fine-tuning configurations.

We also evaluated the closed model GPT-4o [50], recurrent neural network baseline like TextRNN [51] and FastText [52]. Parameter size and deployment resources of PLMs are shown in Table 24. To ensure a fair comparison, all experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, except for LLaMA3-70B, which required 4 A100 GPUs due to its larger size.

We evaluated on 2,000 test cases from 2021 to measure inference performance. Hyper-Parameters Inference was conducted with a fixed temperature of 0.2, controlling the randomness of output generation. Through multiple pilot experiments, we found that this value offered the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness. LLMs are fine-tuned with LoRA, whereas BERT is fully fine-tuned. Following [53], we set r = 8 and LoRA\u03b1 = 16, which bal- ance training efficiency and performance for the classification task, providing sufficient task-specific adaptation without excessive computational cost. Our fine-tuning and test scripts are publicly available5. 4Model sizes and deployment requirements are referenced from the official NVIDIA NIM documentation: https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/ latest/introduction.html. 5https://github.com/hiXixi66/PLMs-Crash-Narrative-Analysis 15 4.2. Manner of collision To evaluate both the overall correctness of predictions and the balance of performance across different classes, we assessed model performance us- ing accuracy and Macro F1-score [54]. In addition, deploying, training, and running inference with LLMs and BERT require substantial computational resources. To better understand the trade-offs, we compare models of differ- ent sizes and from different providers, reporting both training and inference times. These results are then analyzed together with accuracy and Macro F1-score to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the whole framework. During manual inspection, we found that Unknown (label ID: 9) in the original dataset could reasonably be reassigned to other valid categories. Therefore, in addition to reporting results on the original dataset, we also present evaluations with this label Unknown excluded to provide a more precise assessment of model performance. Results of different baselines and LLMs on Manner of Collision The overall results of MANCOLL classification are summarized in Table 3. We reported results both including and excluding Unknown in the column ALL and \u2013Unknown respectively. Fine-tuning brings significant improve- ments to open-source models and their accuracies are much higher than Tex- tRNN and FastText.

We reported results both including and excluding Unknown in the column ALL and \u2013Unknown respectively. Fine-tuning brings significant improve- ments to open-source models and their accuracies are much higher than Tex- tRNN and FastText. For example, the LLaMA3-3B model improves from an initial accuracy of 50.2% to over 95.1% after fine-tuning. At the same time, the performance of fine-tuned LLaMA3-3B and BERT models is comparable to that of 7B and 8B models and outperforms GPT-4o, despite being sig- nificantly smaller in model size and computational requirements. Training efficiency is also notable: convergence is achieved efficiently, requiring only 148.6 seconds for BERT, 890 seconds for the 3B model. Inference time also remains low, with all models below 8B requiring less than 60 ms per instance. The fast training speeds of LLMs are largely attributed by our problem for- mulation, where the task is cast as a classification problem and the LLM only needs to generate a single token as output. Another important observation concerns the Unknown class in the original dataset. As shown in Table 3, re- moving this class yields a clear improvement in both accuracy and macro F1 score. Our sample analysis revealed that many instances labeled as Unknown could in fact be reasonably mapped to known categories, and the employed LLMs were often able to classify them correctly. Overall, these findings demonstrate that with only a small number of fine- tuning steps, even relatively small-scale PLMs can be effectively adapted for 16 Table 3: Results of various LLMs on Manner of Collision (MANCOLL) classification task.

Effect of training data To better understand how data quality and quantity influence model per- formance, we examine the effects of label noise and varying amounts of train- ing samples. These experiments provide insights into the robustness of high- performing models (FastText, BERT and LLMs) in the MANCOLL classification 17 task and their ability to leverage limited or imperfect data. Effect of noisy data. In real application scenarios, labeled data are influenced by the knowledge of human investigator, so the data cannot be guaranteed to be fully correct and may inevitably contain noise. However, the downstream application requires reliable predictions on clean inputs. There- fore, to evaluate the robustness of the models, we further examined their generalization by fine-tuning on noisy data and then testing on the clean dataset. In this experiment, we introduce label noise by randomly assigning a subset of the data samples6 to one random class, and then train models on this noisy dataset while testing on the original clean test set. As shown in Figure 5, we observe that when the noise ratio is below 30%, the performance of all models does not drop substantially, indicating that these methods are relatively robust to moderate levels of noise. And LLaMA3-3B consistently outperforms BERT, benefiting from background knowledge in its prompts, whereas BERT and FastText lack this advantage. Nevertheless, when the noise ratio increases further (the red box in Figure 5a), the performance of the LLM drops sharply. This is likely due to knowledge conflicts between the prior knowledge encoded in the prompts and the noisy training signals. Effect of training samples amount. To enhance the performance of pre-trained language models on traffic data analysis through fine-tuning, a sufficient amount of annotated data is required. However, producing large annotation quantities is labor-intensive and costly. Therefore, we conduct experiments to analyze how the size of the training dataset affects model performance. Out of this concern, we investigate the impact of the number of training samples on model performance. In this experiment, we fine-tune the models using training sets of vary- ing sizes, ranging from 200 to 2,000 cases7. As shown in Figure 6, with fewer than 400 examples, LLaMA3-3B requires more data to converge due to its longer prompts and bigger model size, whereas BERT and FastText, 6Experiments with noise ratios above 40% are not reported, as such levels indicate severely degraded data quality, making fine-tuning on these datasets impractical and mean- ingless. 7BERT and FastText function primarily as feature extractors and require at least some labeled data for task-specific fine-tuning to perform classification effectively.

However, once the training set reaches around 500 samples (the red box in Figure 6a), LLaMA3-3B experiences an \u201caha stage\u201d with per- formance rising sharply and surpassing both BERT and FastText. Although LLM is more data-hungry at the beginning, it can learn from both prompt and training data more effectively once sufficient training data is available, leading to superior accuracy and Macro F1 performance. 19 Consistency analysis Table 4: Self-Model and Cross-Model Consistency Table Overall consistency Models only Including ground truth (GT) Including: 9 - Unknown 0.9443 0.9438 Excluding: 9 - Unknown 0.9502 0.9508 Self-Model and Cross-Model consistency including: 9 - Unknown BERT LLaMA3 LLaMA3 LLaMA3 Qwen2.5 Mistral LLaMA3 GPT GT 1B 3B 8B 7B 7B 70B 4o BERT 1.00 0.87 0.94 0.94 0.93 0.89 0.91 0.90 0.93 LLaMA3-1B 0.87 0.96 0.86 0.86 0.86 0.83 0.84 0.84 0.86 LLaMA3-3B 0.94 0.86 0.98 0.97 0.95 0.91 0.93 0.91 0.95 LLaMA3-8B 0.94 0.86 0.97 1.00 0.96 0.92 0.93 0.92 0.96 Qwen2.5-7B 0.93 0.86 0.95 0.96 0.99 0.91 0.92 0.92 0.94 Mistral 7B 0.89 0.83 0.91 0.92 0.91 0.98 0.89 0.90 0.91 LLaMA3-70B 0.91 0.84 0.93 0.93 0.92 0.89 0.98 0.92 0.91 GPT-4o 0.90 0.84 0.91 0.92 0.92 0.90 0.92 0.97 0.91 GT 0.93 0.86 0.95 0.96 0.94 0.91 0.91 0.91 1.00 To evaluate the stability of the models, we designed a set of consistency experiments, which include self-consistency, measuring the stability of re- peated outputs from the same model, and cross-model consistency, measuring the agreement between outputs produced by different models. Since the ac- curacy of machine learning based methods is considerably lower than that of transformer-based models, we report consistency results only for transformer- based approaches. Consistency analysis results are summarized in Table 4. Overall, the ma- jority of models show high levels of both self-consistency and cross-model consistency. Besides, the overall consistency results (upper part of table) reveal that excluding ground truth (GT) label slightly increases consistency scores, and removing the Unknown label further improves them. This sug- gests that some inconsistencies may stem from labeling errors: for example, instances marked as Unknown in the dataset were consistently assigned to a specific class by the", "of table) reveal that excluding ground truth (GT) label slightly increases consistency scores, and removing the Unknown label further improves them. This sug- gests that some inconsistencies may stem from labeling errors: for example, instances marked as Unknown in the dataset were consistently assigned to a specific class by the fine-tuned models, and these models strongly agreed on such classifications. This indicates that the models may have identified correct answers that were mislabeled in the ground truth. In terms of self-consistency, all models achieve scores above 0.96, indicat- ing that their outputs remain stable across repeated runs. Regarding cross- model consistency, the majority of model pairs achieve scores exceeding 0.90, highlighting strong agreement between different fine-tuned models. When comparing against the GT, fine-tuned models such as BERT, LLaMA3-3B, 20 LLaMA3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B achieve significantly higher consistency than non-fine-tuned models like GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B. This trend aligns with the improvements previously reported in Table 3. 4.3. Crash type Compared with Manner of Collision, the extraction of Crash Type is more challenging. There are 98 categories in total, and due to the hier- archical structure, shown in Figure 1, the set of candidate CRASHTYPE is determined by the associated CRASHCONF. This decomposes the task into 13 smaller classification subtasks (one for each CRASHCONF), with the largest subtask containing up to 14 classes. Another source of difficulty is that a single crash may involve multiple vehicles. When classifying the CRASHTYPE for one vehicle, the narrative often contains descriptions of other vehicles, which can interfere with or complicate the judgment for the target vehicle. Considering the above, it remains challenging for LLMs to extract infor- mation even though all tasks are within the traffic safety domain. To better understand how model performance can be improved when encountering such complex task, we further experiment with different LoRA projection configu- rations and examine their impact on fine-tuning results. As described earlier in Section 3.1, CRASHCONF classification is a relatively easy task to achieve high accuracy. Therefore, in this part we treat CRASHCONF as oracle knowl- edge and focus only on the classification of CRASHTYPE. Results of different LLM on Crash Type One crash may involve multiple vehicles and other vehicle descriptions can affect the prediction for the target vehicle. To account for this factor, we evaluate model performance by analyzing classification accuracy under dif- ferent vehicle-count settings, grouping crashes into four categories depending on how many vehicles were involved in the crash: 1, 2, 3, and more than 3 vehicles. Given the difficulty of this task, we restricted the evaluation to the models that showed strong performance in the Manner of Collision classifi- cation task, namely BERT and LLMs. Table 5 reports the performance of different models on CRASHTYPE clas- sification under varying numbers of vehicles per crash. The results show that this is a highly challenging task: without fine-tuning, most models achieve very low accuracy, typically in the range of 1%\u223c25%. However, af- ter parameter-efficient fine-tuning, all models see substantial improvements. In particular, LLaMA3-3B, LLaMA3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B consistently reach 21 Table 5: Performance of different LLMs for", "The results show that this is a highly challenging task: without fine-tuning, most models achieve very low accuracy, typically in the range of 1%\u223c25%.

Even the smallest 1B model, once adapted to the traffic safety domain, can surpass GPT-4o and the much larger LLaMA3-70B. Moreover, these smaller models achieve such performance with significantly lower training costs (less than 1 GPU-hour) and inference requirements, striking an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy. When analyzing results across different vehicle counts, we observe that collisions involving exactly two vehicles yield the lowest accuracy for all mod- els. This is to be expected. Single-vehicle cases are the easiest, as the crash narrative only describes one vehicle and contain no textual interference from other vehicles. Multi-vehicle crashes involving three or more vehicles often correspond to chain collisions (e.g., multi-vehicle rear-end crashes), where 22 (a) Fine-tuned on query projection.

This homogeneity reduces ambiguity and makes classification more straightforward, despite the larger number of vehicles. The most challenging setting resides in crashes involving exactly two vehicles. In these cases, the narrative usually mixes descriptions of both vehicles, and their Crash Types are often different. Consequently, two-vehicle crashes represent the most difficult scenario, demanding stronger reasoning and disambiguation capabilities from the models.

Effect of LoRA Training Strategies Given the complexity of the Crash Type classification task, we further explore how LoRA-adapted parameters impacts performance. Specifically, we vary which attention projection matrices to be trained under LoRA, se- lecting from the query, key, and value projections WQ, WK, WV \u2208Rd\u00d7k. We consider three configurations: (i) LoRA on WQ only; (ii) LoRA on WQ and WV ; and (iii) LoRA on all three, WQ, WK, and WV 8. Results in Figure 7 show that the accuracy increases monotonically with the number of adapted attention matrices: Updating WQ alone yields the weakest performance; adapting both WQ and WV performs better; and jointly 8Since the self-attention output is a weighted sum of values, fine-tuning different single projection matrices introduces additional low-rank weight on the same attention mecha- nism. Therefore, varying which of WQ, WK, and WV are fine-tuned does not drastically have a large impact, although increasing the number of projections equipped with LoRA adapters does. 23 adapting WQ, WK, and WV achieves the best results. We attribute this to the task\u2019s requirement for token interactions: restricting adaptation to queries constrains the model\u2019s ability to reshape attention patterns; co-adapting keys improves query\u2013key alignment for retrieval, while adapting values allows the model to better propagate matched evidence through the representation. In short, enabling LoRA on multiple attention projections provides the neces- sary degrees of freedom to fit the Crash Type task more effectively. Consistency analysis Looking at the available statistics, crashes involving one single vehicle or two vehicles account for nearly the same amount of crashes, and together they represent over 93% of all available crashes. Since such crashes are also the primary interest of researchers, our consistency analysis focuses on these two settings. For single-vehicle setting, as shown in Figure 8a, we observe that LLaMA3- 3B, LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B show near-perfect run-to-run agreement (\u223c0.98) on the diagonal, while smaller models LLaMA3-1B maintain a self- consistency (\u223c0.87). This indicates that fine-tuned models yield stable outputs across runs on CRASHTYPE classification. The agreements between LLaMA3-3B, LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B are also high (\u223c0.91), suggest- ing that different LLMs converge to similar predictions despite variying in size and architecture. When compared with CISS ground-truth labels (GT), the average consistency is slightly lower (\u223c0.78), reflecting the possible pres- ence of annotation noise and labeling errors in the dataset, which LLMs may help to mitigate. For the two-vehicle setting, as shown in Figure 8b, we observe a simi- lar trend as in the single-vehicle case: larger models such as LLaMA3-3B, LLaMA3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B maintain high self-consistency, while smaller models like LLaMA3-1B achieve a reasonable level of self-consistency (\u223c 0.87). However, cross-model agreements among LLaMA3-3B, LLaMA3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B drop noticeably (to around 0.79). Compared with CISS ground-truth labels, the average cross-consistency (\u223c0.78) is also lower than in the single-vehicle setting. All above reflect a reduced accuracy because of the added complexity and ambiguity of multi-vehicle crash narratives. 24 (a) Single-vehicle setting (b) Two-vehicle setting Figure 8: Self-Model and", "drop noticeably (to around 0.79).

Data Analysis 5.1. Distribution of reclassified Unknown MANCOLL cases In the original database, the proportion of samples labeled as Unknown is about 1.6%. Previous experiments demonstrated that LLMs achieve strong overall performance on the MANCOLL classification task, with some models reaching up to 97% accuracy. Notably, the models were also able to reassign many of the samples originally labeled as Unknown into more specific cate- gories. To further investigate this behavior, we conducted a detailed analysis focusing on the predictions for the Unknown subset. As shown in Figure 9, categories 2 (Head-On) and 6 (Sideswipe, Opposite Direction) consistently appear with very low proportions across all models. This is partly because these categories are rare in the original ground-truth annotations, and also because narrative descriptions often provide limited clues for such cases. In contrast, models (c)\u2013(f) maintain a relatively stable distribution pattern, showing that PLMs not only resolve the ambiguity in Unknown cases but also exhibit strong cross-model consistency, which en- hances the reliability of the results. 5.2. CRASHTYPE distributions: CISS annotations vs. LLM predictions To further verify that the labels generated by the LLM do not substan- tially alter the intrinsic characteristics of the data, we compared some statis- tics between LLM-generated labels and ground-truth. Here we primarily 25 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) Figure 9: Distributional analysis of MANCOLL cases originally labeled as Unknown.

For single-vehicle crashes, we conduct distributional analysis of Crash Type, while for two-vehicle crashes, we per- form correlation analysis to assess the association between the Crash Types of the two vehicles. 26 (a) LLaMA3-1B (b) LLaMA3-3B (c) LLaMA3-8B (d) Qwen2.5-7B (e) LLaMA3-70B (f) GPT-4o Figure 10: Comparison of CRASHTYPE distributions between the CISS ground truth (blue) and LLM-predicted results (red) for crashes involving a single vehicle. Each subplot corre- sponds to a different model, with the JS divergence reported as a measure of distributional similarity. Single-vehicle setting To characterize single-vehicle crashes, we analyze the distribution of their Crash Types. Specifically, we compute the frequency distribution of the most common crash categories (1-16), and the overall divergence of the distribu- tion. Since some Crash Types in the distribution may have zero or near-zero frequencies, we adopt Jensen\u2013Shannon (JS) divergence [55] to measure the difference between the two distributions, as it is symmetric, bounded, and robust to zero-probability events, thereby avoiding the divergence issues in- herent in Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence [56].

Figure 10 presents the predicted distribution of single-vehicle CRASHTYPE across different models, where only the first 16 crash categories are included since single-vehicle data is restricted to this subset. Overall, the fine-tuned models successfully preserve the distributional characteristics of the ground- truth data: the relative frequency and ranking of each class are largely con- sistent with the ground truth labels. Moreover, except for the 1B model, all 27 Table 6: Examples of single-vehicle CRASHTYPE categories related to road departure Code Description Departure Direction 1 Roadside departure under a controlled situation. Right 2 Roadside departure because of lost traction or control. Right 6 Roadside departure under a controlled situation. Left 7 Roadside departure because of lost traction or control. Left fine-tuned models achieve closer alignment with the ground-truth distribu- tion compared to much larger non-fine-tuned models such as LLaMA3-70B and GPT-4o. Besides, noticeable discrepancies remain for certain categories, particularly CRASHTYPE 1, 2, 6, and 79. The boxed regions in the histogram illustrate a complementary phenomenon between the ground truth distri- bution and the LLM-predicted results. Specifically, the discrepancies arise mainly from whether the model correctly captures the detail of losing control or not. Because the LLM fails to fully recognize this subtle distinction, its predicted frequencies are shifted compared to the ground truth. Interestingly, similar complementary patterns are consistently observed across fine-tuned models, which indicates that this misalignment is not accidental. Through manual inspection of the CISS dataset, we found that part of this mismatch arises from inconsistencies in the recorded ground truth in CISS, where some cases were not assigned correctly. Illustrative examples of such issues are provided in Appendix B.1. Two-vehicle setting Crash types of vehicles in the same accident are naturally related. To quantify this, we compute correlation coefficients using Kendall\u2019s Tau [57]. Since the Crash Type values are discrete identifiers rather than continuous quantities, Kendall\u2019s Tau is more appropriate than Pearson or Spearman correlation [58]. It is important to note that in this task, a higher correlation is not necessarily better; instead, what matters is whether the correlation obtained from the predicted labels is closely aligned with the ground-truth correlation. As shown in Figure 11, models with higher classification accuracy gener- ally yield correlations closer to ground truth. Across all fine-tuned models, 9The detailed definitions of these Crash Types are provided in Table 6 28 (a) LLaMA3-1B (b) LLaMA3-3B (c) LLaMA3-8B (d) Qwen2.5-7B (e) LLaMA3-70B (f) GPT-4o Figure 11: Correlation analysis of CRASHTYPE combinations between two vehicles in the same crash.

Discussion In this section we discuss the results with respect to task-specific seman- tics, data annotation, quality and quantity of the data and model perfor- mance. Task-specific semantics. We investigate whether fine-tuned LLMs ac- quire sufficient task-specific semantics, given that such semantics are em- bedded in the fine-tuning data. During fine-tuning, the model continuously updates its internal representations through gradient descent, making it more sensitive to the semantic cues of the target task and achieving a more fine- grained understanding. Consequently, the fine-tuned smaller LLMs outper- form the larger LLMs without fine-tuning. 29 However, these improvements remain limited. For tasks such as Manner of Collision extraction, the model only needs to capture the overall seman- tics of the narrative by identifying the primary collision pattern. Plugging categories are semantically well-separated in the embedding space, LLMs perform well without requiring fine-grained discrimination of textual details. Even if minor information is missed, the model can still predict the correct overall class. In contrast, Crash Type requires accurate per-vehicle predic- tion among interwoven descriptions. To achieve this goal, the model has to carefully identify the target entity, accurately track target vehicles\u2019 motion states, and resolve causal relations between events, while resisting mislead- ing information from other vehicle descriptions. Here, even small errors such as confusing subjects and objects can lead to misclassification as shown in Appendix B.4. Although the self-attention mechanism enables the capture of long-range dependencies, it does not guarantee that all necessary seman- tics for answering the question are correctly identified. At the same time, the model is not fully resilient against irrelevant semantic details, making it prone to interference when vehicle descriptions are densely interwoven. As a result, LLMs are less effective at per-vehicle Crash Type classification com- pared to per-crash Manner of Collision classification. A promising solution is to incorporate attention guidance methods [59, 60], which can steer the model toward finer-grained semantic cues and enhance its ability to identify critical details. Enhancing crash data annotation. Through the analysis of PLM- annotated data, we found that PLMs can successfully reclassify crashes orig- inally labeled as Unknown in the CISS dataset into specific categories (Ap- pendix B.2). They can also correct occasional labeling errors in the existing crash data (Appendix B.1), even though such errors are relatively rare. The high level of agreement across different models further supports the relia- bility of these classifications. Besides, we also studied if fine-tuned models introduce bias when classifying. In the two-vehicle setting, the compari- son between CISS annotations and model predictions shows that fine-tuned models preserve the relational characteristics of crash data without intro- ducing distributional bias. Overall, fine-tuned PLMs show strong potential to augment human annotation, correct errors, and improve the quality and reliability of crash datasets.

Data quality, quantity, and robust model performance. When varying the noise ratio in the training data, we find that all models remain robust under moderate label noise (\u226430%). This is because, when noise is 30 random and class-independent, the gradients from incorrect labels tend to cancel out in expectation, while the remaining 70% of clean samples dominate learning and keep the decision boundary aligned with the correct direction. However, as the noise ratio increases further, LLM performance drops sharply due to conflicts between knowledge encoded in the prompt and the noisy training signals. In terms of training data scale, BERT and FastText perform better on very small datasets, whereas LLM is data-hungry. Because training involves additional prompts, its improvements are slower and it requires more data to converge. However, once the training set exceeds, the LLM exhibits an \u201caha\u201d phase, with performance rising sharply and surpassing the other models. These results on relatively simple tasks highlight a trade-off among data quality, data quantity, and model performance. 7. Conclusion This work demonstrates that compact open-source PLMs, after fine- tuning with task-specific knowledge, can provide state-of-the-art performance for reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives, a long-standing chal- lenge in traffic safety research where accurate analysis of crash is essential for crash prevention strategies and policy making. Our BERT and 3B model out- performs GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B in identifying per-crash collision man- ner and per-vehicle Crash Type in multi-vehicle scenarios, while requiring only limited training steps, modest resources, and delivering fast inference. Consistency analyses further show strong robustness across models and sce- narios, enabling reliable per-vehicle Crash Type labeling from complex narra- tives. Through the analysis of LLM-annotated data, we found that fine-tuned PLMs can correct labeling errors, address deficiencies caused by limited hu- man knowledge, and preserve relational characteristics of the data without introducing bias. In addition, the approach mitigates privacy concerns as- sociated with APIs and reduces deployment cost. Furthermore, experiments with varying levels of label noise demonstrate the robustness of PLMs, while scaling the amount of training data further highlights their potential to re- duce human effort in data annotation. All the above prove that automated annotation using PLMs is an alter- native to labor-intensive manual coding. While our evaluation focuses on the U.S. CISS dataset and two extraction tasks, future work will explore broader safety information extraction (e.g., causal chains), uncertainty calibration, and aligning different annotation standards for comparative analysis. Over- 31 all, domain-adapted open-source PLMs offer a resource-efficient, privacy- preserving, and robust solution to improve traffic safety research through scalable crash narrative analysis. 8.

Reasoning-oriented LLMs. Our experiments used BERT and instruction- tuned LLMs that directly output predictions. Although we used Chain-of- Thought prompting for LLMs, the models did not explicitly generate inter- mediate reasoning steps, nor did we adopt reasoning-specific models so as to reduce computation. Prior studies have shown that encouraging LLMs to articulate their reasoning process can improve prediction accuracy. In addi- tion, during fine-tuning, it is possible to introduce guidance tokens that help the model learn to structure its reasoning. However, these approaches will also increase the computational costs.

Case study Appendix B.1. Correct Prediction under Wrong Label Here is an example where the fine-tuned PLM provides a more accurate classification compared to the ground-truth. In this case, the narrative text shows no clear indication of vehicle loss of control. While the ground-truth labeled it as a loss-of-control departure (7), the fine-tuned model identified it as a controlled left roadside departure (6). According to the coding guidelines in CISS, the first departure event should be considered and \u201closs of control\u201d is defined as situations where the vehicle spins off due to surface conditions, oversteer phenomena, or mechanical malfunctions. Here, the vehicle first departed to the left roadside without cause explanation. The subsequent 35 loss of control occurred as a consequence of this departure, not as its cause. Furthermore, in cases of doubt, the guideline explicitly advises using code \u201c06\u201d (Left Roadside Departure, Drive Off Road). In this way, to classify this case correctly, the model must capture crash causality, distinguish first events from outcomes, and apply the definition of \u201closs of control\u201d with coding rules. SUMMARY: V#1 was traveling east, negotiating a curve left, in lane 1 of a 2 lane, two way roadway. V#1 departed the roadway to the left, entered a drainage ditch area, and contacted an embankment with its front plane. The impact caused the vehicle to rotate in a counter clockwise direction where its front plane contacted the embankment a second time. The rear of V#1 then elevated vertically into the air and continued to rotate counter clockwise as it re-entered the roadway. The vehicle then traveled backwards, departed the roadway to the left a second time, and began to rotate in a clockwise direction. The vehicle then rolled over one quarter turn onto its right side plane against an embankment, and came to final rest approximately 9 meters from the initial contact point, facing west. Ground Truth: 7 \u2013 Left roadside departure because of lost traction or control. (Not True) Mistral-7B fine-tuned with 1251 steps (LLM): 6 \u2013 Left roadside departure under a controlled situation. (True) To illustrate the distinction between controlled departures and loss-of- control scenarios, we present the following example, which clearly represents a loss-of-control crash. In this case, Vehicle #1 departed its lane to the left and began rotating clockwise, providing clear evidence of a loss-of-control condition. Both the ground-truth label and the fine-tuned model correctly classified this as \u201c7 \u2014 Left roadside departure because of lost traction or control\u201d. SUMMARY: V#1 was traveling in a northern direction, on a two lane, non divided, bidirectional, dirt roadway with a", "clockwise, providing clear evidence of a loss-of-control condition. Both the ground-truth label and the fine-tuned model correctly classified this as \u201c7 \u2014 Left roadside departure because of lost traction or control\u201d. SUMMARY: V#1 was traveling in a northern direction, on a two lane, non divided, bidirectional, dirt roadway with a downward grade, and a curve to the right. V#1 left its lane to the left, where it began to rotate clockwise. V#1 left the roadway to the left, where it overturned 6 quarter turns coming to final rest on its roof in the south bound lane of travel. Ground Truth: 7 \u2013 Left roadside departure because of lost traction or control.

From Unknown to Specific Here is an example that illustrates how fine-tuned PLMs can success- fully resolve instances labeled as Unknown in the CISS dataset. Despite the ground truth being marked as 9 (Unknown), the model correctly identi- fied the collision type as a Angle crash, demonstrating fine-tuned LLMs can identify and correct errors in the existing labels of crash data. SUMMARY: V2 was stopped southbound in a three lane intersection in lane three, awaiting to turn left eastbound. V1 was traveling westbound on a three lane road in lane two approaching the same intersection. V1 entered the south bound travel lanes of the intersecting roadway, where the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. Ground Truth: 9 \u2013 Unknown Mistral-7B fine-tuned with 1251 steps (LLM): 4 \u2013 Angle. (True) Appendix B.3. Crash type classification in multi-vehicle scenario Here is an example that illustrates why fine-tuned LLMs perform better in scenarios involving more than two vehicles. The reason is that many vehicles beyond the second one are categorized into the class 98 (Third or subsequent vehicles involved in a crash). This aggregation reduces the classification granularity for such vehicles, effectively lowering the difficulty of prediction. As a result, when multiple vehicles are present, the model can rely on this broader category assignment, which improves overall performance compared to the more fine-grained distinctions required in two-vehicle crashes. 37 SUMMARY: V1 was traveling north in the #1 lane of a 5 lane divided roadway. V2 was stopped facing west in the #2 lane of a 5 lane undivided roadway. V3 was stopped facing west in the #1 lane of a 5 lane undivided roadway. V5 was stopped facing south in the #5 lane of a 5 lane divided roadway. V1 traveled through the intersection. V2 and V3 started to accelerate and entered the intersection. The front of V1 impacted the left of V2. V2 rotated clockwise and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V3. V1 continued through the intersection where the front of V1 impacted the center median curb. V1 continued forward where the front of V1 impacted the left side of V5.

Crash type classification in two-vehicle scenario In this example, the fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model fails to correctly dis- tinguish the Crash Types of V1 and V2. The primary difficulty arises from the narrative, where the descriptions of V1 and V2 are closely intertwined, making it hard for the model to disentangle their respective roles. Moreover, the fact that both vehicles rotated and came to rest in similar orientations further complicates classification, as these post-crash states provide limited discriminative cues. The only decisive difference is that V1 rear-ended V2, while V2 was rear-ended by V1. This subtle asymmetry requires precise tracking of subject\u2013object relations in the narrative. The model\u2019s predic- tion error suggests that it could not fully capture all semantics encoded in the prompt, highlighting a key limitation of LLMs in fine-grained, semantic- sensitive classification. 38 SUMMARY: V1 was negotiating a right curve traveling east in the first of four lanes on a divided highway. V2 was traveling east in the same lane ahead of V1. The front of V1 contacted the back of V2. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest on the roadway facing northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest on the roadway facing northeast. Ground Truth: Vehicle 1: 24 \u2013 Rear-end: slower (a vehicle that impacts another vehicle from the rear when the struck vehicle was going slower than the striking vehicle.) Vehicle 2: 25 \u2013 Rear-end: slower, going straight (a rear-ended vehicle that was going slower than the other vehicle while proceeding straight ahead.) LLaMA3-8B fine-tuned with 2163 steps (LLM): Vehicle 1: 24 \u2013 Rear-end: slower (True) Vehicle 2: 24 \u2013 Rear-end: slower (False) References [1] World Health Organization, Global status report on road safety 2023, 2023.

Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet. In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel in- dices and the Alps infrastructure\u2014a state-of-the-art, highly energy- efficient arm64 supercluster \u2014we were able to index 8.6 T tokens out of 15.2 T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the en- tire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety. We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempt- ing large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.

Based on a simple principle - pretraining for next or missing tokens prediction [45, 48] - fol- lowed by universal instruction-following fine-tuning [40, 57], their impressive multidomain capabilities stem primarily from pretrain- ing on massive web-scale datasets containing elements of texts required for instruction-following [20]. While most LLM training datasets are closed, several ubiquitous large-scale public datasets emerged, notably Common Crawl, and its derivatives, such as The Pile [16],C4 [49], FineWeb [43], or FineWeb2 [44], among many oth- ers. Common Crawl and its derivatives contribute to the training of most widely used LLMs, such as GPT-3, for which it supplied 80% of the data [6]. However, the training data scale is a double-edged sword. The same scale that enables the emerging LLM multidomain capabili- ties also enables highly problematic emerging behaviors [2]. The web-mined corpora, often not publicly shared, inevitably contain problematic content leading to problematic LLM behaviors [27, 33], that must be carefully analyzed to understand model capabilities and risks [17, 35]. Beyond the unprompted LLM toxicity arising from the inclusion of the baseline social media toxicity into the crawls [18, 32], training data has been discovered to contain private, copyrighted, abusive, or intentionally misleading information, among others. Personal information, such as names, social security numbers, and contacts, leaking from training data has been successfully extracted from GPT-2 and ChatGPT [9, 37], following their extensive memorization abilities from single examples [7, 8]. New York Times has blocked OpenAI\u2019s crawler and sued them over unauthorized copyrighted content use for model training [47].

(CSAM) has been discovered in the training data of several mod- els [10]. Malicious actors have been discovered to inject disinforma- tion into LLM training and reference data, such as Kremlin-affiliated Pravda Network [50]. Problematic training data leads to problematic LLM behaviors. Even for API-only models with generation-time filtering and guardrails, jailbreaking and imperfect guardrails have led to highly problematic content generation, resulting in disastrous real-world impacts [41]. For open-weight models, such protection is impossible, and not only can they be easily jailbroken [31], especially in a multilingual setting [56], but any alignment tuning can be removed through post- training [53], unlocking problematic capabilities acquired from the training data. As such, the only reliable approach to LLM security and safety is in-depth analysis and curation of LLM training data [39]. Yet, in practice, even for open-weight models, systematic exam- ination of training datasets remains extremely challenging. Widely used models typically disclose only broad information about their data sources, limiting transparency, reproducibility, and ultimately our ability to assess or guarantee their safety. As part of the Apertus LLM [21] transparency effort, we address this issue a single LLM family at a time, by indexing for full-text search the already open and reproducible Apertus LLM training data. To achieve it, we scale up a prior approach based on Elas- ticsearch full-text indexing allowing for fuzzy matching", "the Apertus LLM [21] transparency effort, we address this issue a single LLM family at a time, by indexing for full-text search the already open and reproducible Apertus LLM training data. To achieve it, we scale up a prior approach based on Elas- ticsearch full-text indexing allowing for fuzzy matching and logic operations [14], leveraging the Alps supercluster Machine Learning Platform, built and managed by the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) [30, 51]. Our contributions are threefold: \u2022 Elasticsearch on ARM64: We provide a technical overview of challenges, solutions, and configuration overviews for deploying Elasticsearch on ALPS, an ARM64-based GH200 high-performance computer (HPC) supercluster. While ARM64 offers future-ready energy efficiency, it poses compatibility challenges even for the most common software developed and deployed on x86/amd64 systems. \u2022 Indexing and performance evaluation: We index an 8.6 T token dataset of the 15.2 T Apertus training and pretraining dataset, doubling the size compared to the previous largest full-text index of that type, Infinigram [24], and quadrupling the pre- vious Elasticsearch-based one, WhatIsInMyBigData [14]. We open-source our code 1 and report the performance during indexing and search for a range of deployment configura- tions, allowing for replication and future work on web-scale data indexing. \u2022 Security and safety use cases: We demonstrate two LLM safety and security usecases of LLM full-text indices, focusing on derogotary language in a multilingual setting and helpful- ness for indiscriminate weapons creation. By shifting attention from post-training alignment to the foun- dational quality of training data, our approach provides the scalable infrastructure needed for safer, more transparent, and more ac- countable AI development. 1https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/apertus-pretraining-data- indexing 2 Related Work The main technical challenge in creating pipelines for transpar- ent auditing of LLM training data is the massive size of these datasets. As a result, many existing tools attempt to overcome these limitations in various ways. Some methods perform approximate membership inference to reduce computational costs, such as Data Portraits [29]. Others analyze only small statistical samples\u2014for example, 1% of Common Crawl (circa 81 GB), such as Luccioni and Viviano in [27], or a one-million-random-web-pages sample in [33]. While such approaches are excellent for exploratory safety work, guaranteeing LLM safety and security requires full training dataset coverage. Several studies approached smaller datasets. Tools such as Data Measurements on HuggingFace [28] and Know Your Data from Google [19] were created to automate and improve data documen- tation for smaller, specific datasets. Additionally, in-depth analyses have been performed on specialized datasets, such as the COVID- 19 Open Research Dataset [59], the QuoteBank corpus [55], and medical data [38]. However, none of them have been developed for the scale the modern SotA LLM training requires. World-Wide-Web scale data indexing for LLM safety and secu- rity has gained increasing interest in recent years. For example, Dodge et al. in [12] analyzed multiple problematic aspects of the C4 corpus(156 B tokens, English-only) and created an Elasticsearch full-text index for it. Piktus et al. in [46] were the first to offer both fuzzy and exact search on ROOTS, a 1.6 TB multilingual text corpus. The WhatIsInMyBigData tool [14]", "et al. in [12] analyzed multiple problematic aspects of the C4 corpus(156 B tokens, English-only) and created an Elasticsearch full-text index for it. Piktus et al. in [46] were the first to offer both fuzzy and exact search on ROOTS, a 1.6 TB multilingual text corpus. The WhatIsInMyBigData tool [14] applied ElasticSearch to several datasets, including C4 (156 B Tokens), RedPajama (1.4 T tokens), and The Pile (380 B tokens). While laudable initiatives, covering full training data of older LLMs, such as Eleuther GPT, BLOOM, or Pythia families [3, 4, 36], these approaches have not scaled to the SotA multi-trillion token territory. Finally, most recently, Infinigram [24] has used Burrow-Wheeler Transform-like suffix arrays, enabling millisecond-fast exact search on datasets such as OLMo 2 Instruct (4.6 T tokens), Dolma-v1.7 (2.6 T tokens), RedPajama, and The Pile. While an impressive per- formance and arguably the only SotA LLM training dataset index, Infinigram only allows for exact text matching. In turn, this makes fuzzy search and logic operators significantly more involved, which is problematic given that numerous downstream tasks require them, such as training data attribution of LLM-generated texts [58]. 3 Data and Tools We first describe the datasets that were indexed and the datasets of search queries used for analysis (Section 3.1), then present Elas- ticsearch, the full-text search system employed for indexing and search (Section 3.2), and finally outline the technical details of the computing environment used in this work (Section 3.3).

It aggregates web documents from a diverse set Getting Your Indices in a Row: Full-Text Search for LLM Training Data for Real World WWW \u201926, April 13\u201317, 2026, Dubai, UAE of sources, applying filtering and deduplication to ensure linguis- tic diversity and textual quality. In the training of Apertus, three additional datasets derived from FineWeb are used: FineWeb-Edu, FineWeb-2 and FineWeb-2-HQ [26, 34, 44]. FineWeb-Edu filters ed- ucational web pages from the FineWeb dataset. Additionally, an educational quality classifier based on Llama3-70B-Instruct [13] is used to score each page, for further filtering. For Apertus train- ing only pages with an educational quality score of 2 or higher are considered. Last, FineWeb-2-HQ considers the top 10% quality docu- ments of FineWeb-2 for the top 20 highest resource languages, based on a classifier using XLM-RoBERTa embeddings, and re-hydrades the deduplicated dataset, adding up to 8 copies of abundant high- quality documents [34]. 3.1.2 Apertus training data. Apertus pretraining data underwent additional processing before being used in training. First, copy- righted material remaining in the training datasets is identified and removed. Second, data from from websites that have opted out of crawling by AI-related crawlers as of January 2025 is re- moved as well. Third, all detected email addresses, IP addresses and IBAN bank account numbers are replaced with anonymous mark- ers. Finally, toxicity filtering is performed across nine languages, with custom-trained", "data from from websites that have opted out of crawling by AI-related crawlers as of January 2025 is re- moved as well. Third, all detected email addresses, IP addresses and IBAN bank account numbers are replaced with anonymous mark- ers. Finally, toxicity filtering is performed across nine languages, with custom-trained language-specific classifiers, with data for low- resource languages being preserved as is. The full pipeline for the creation of the training data has been made publicly available 2 and more information on each of these filtering steps is described in the technical report of Apertus [21]. 3.1.3 Indexed datasets. In this section, we describe the used subset of the Apertus training data. In total, we indexed a text volume of 8.6 T tokens, corresponding to 58% of the current total training data (15 T), providing a dataset comparable in scale to the full training corpus. This enables the characterization of indexing and analysis efficiency on large-scale data. Specifically, we indexed all datasets included in Phase 1 of the Apertus pretraining, as described in the technical report [21]. While Phase 1 utilized approximately 5 T tokens, the datasets we indexed correspond to supersets that were also sampled in later phases, resulting in a higher Apertus training data coverage on our side. Table 1 displays the different components. The most prominent datasets are FineWeb-Edu [26], the 33% documents of highest qual- ity from FineWeb-2-HQ [34], and for the languages not included in FineWeb-2-HQ a randomly sampled 33% from FineWeb-2 [44]. Ad- ditionally, StarCoder code-specific dataset was included [23], along with a Common Crawl math-focused subset, extracted as part of SmolLM2 LLM training [1]. Finally, the permissively licensed books from Project Gutenberg [15] data is added to the pretraining mix to evaluate the memorization of book-like content, while Poison data is performance-neutral data added as part of persistent pretraining data poisoning research [60]. 2https://github.com/swiss-ai/pretrain-data Dataset Tokens (B) FineWeb-Edu (Score-2) 4815 FineWeb-2-HQ (33% highest quality) and FineWeb-2 (33% sample of other languages) 3557 StarCoder 235 FineMath CommonCrawl subset 32 Gutenberg and Poison 2 Table 1: Overview of the datasets indexed, along with the total number of tokens in each dataset. The core strength of both Apertus and FineWeb-2 dataset is the attention to multilinguality. For this reason, we also focus our atten- tion in Section 6 on the presence of harmful content across various languages. Given that Apertus was developed in Switzerland, in addition to English we consider Swiss German (gsw) and the official Swiss languages (Italian (ita), German (deu), French (fra)) that are high-resource. Additionally, we attempt to sample non-european and lower-resource languages by focusing on Arabic, Thai, Kabyle, and Filipino. Finally, we investigate Esperanto as an example of synthetic language without a native speaker population. 3.1.4 Datasets of search queries. One goal of the indexing and search pipeline is to examine the presence and distribution of poten- tially harmful or otherwise problematic content within the Apertus training data. For this, we focus on three LLM security and safety- related use cases: \u2022 Weaponized Words dictionary3: Is a large multilingual lexicon of curse words, slurs,", "indexing and search pipeline is to examine the presence and distribution of poten- tially harmful or otherwise problematic content within the Apertus training data. For this, we focus on three LLM security and safety- related use cases: \u2022 Weaponized Words dictionary3: Is a large multilingual lexicon of curse words, slurs, and other forms of toxic or discriminatory language, maintained covering over 137 lan- guages across 236 countries. Table 2 shows the number of terms for each of the languages we consider: English, Italian, French and German. The lengths of the harmful terms range from 1 to 3 words. Note that we cannot publicly disclose this dataset, as access is restricted to research teams upon special request per the Weaponized Word Terms of Service. \u2022 Obscene Words list [52]: The List of Dirty, Naughty, Ob- scene, and Otherwise Bad Words (LDNOOBW) is a collection of profane and offensive terms used for cleaning of the Colos- sal Clean Crawled Corpus [11]. The strength of the dataset is that it contains contains terms for 28 languages, including several low-resource languages such as Kabyle and Thai. The length of the profanities ranges from 1 to 5 words. In our analysis we consider the languages English, Italian, French, German, Arabic, Filipino, Esperanto, Kabyle and Thai. Table 2 shows for each language the number of profanities that is included in the dataset. \u2022 Chemical weapons dataset: A curated list of dangerous chemical agents selected from A Laboratory History of Chem- ical Warfare Agents by Jared Ledgard [22]. Containing de- tailed synthesis instruction of chemical warfare agents, this book has only been freely available on the internet and only recently was de-indexed, with excerpts from it likely being included into LLM pretraining dataset, potentially making 3https://weaponizedword.org/ WWW \u201926, April 13\u201317, 2026, Dubai, UAE Altemir Mari\u00f1as et al. them helpful for indiscriminate weapons creation. We fo- cus on several simple blood agents and their precursors to find potentially problematic contents in the internet, while leaving general-purpose chemistry knowledge intact. The dataset displayed in Table 3 contains 17 terms, and we focus on several of the languages most likely to be used within Switzerland to look for this type of information, notably Dutch, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, and Portuguese. For each dataset, we report raw occurrence counts rather than terms prevalence, given that prior research suggests that knowl- edge acquisition and memorization are determined by information occurrence rather than prevalence [9].

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and ana- lytics engine designed for efficiently handling large-scale text and structured data, commonly considered as a NoSQL database or a local search engine. At its core, it transforms raw information into an optimized index that allows users to perform fast and flexible queries, ranging from simple keyword lookups to complex seman- tic searches. This indexing-and-search model makes it especially well-suited for working with massive, heterogeneous datasets, such as collections of web-scraped documents, leading to its choice by several previous projects analyzing LLM training data. In the described pipeline, raw data is stored as Parquet files and streamed into the indexing process to avoid overwhelming memory resources. Before being stored, the text undergoes multiple levels of processing via configurable analyzers, which generate different searchable representations \u2014 from normalized text suitable for semantic search, to exact forms that preserve original formatting and structure. Scalability is achieved through Elasticsearch\u2019s distributed archi- tecture. Data is partitioned into shards and indexed in parallel, al- lowing multiple workers to process separate portions of the dataset simultaneously. Performance is further enhanced through tech- niques such as bulk indexing, adjustable batch sizes, and dynamic refresh intervals, which balance throughput and responsiveness during large-scale operations. For datasets too large to fit on a single node, advanced cluster management strategies allow a scalable search cluster. Separate Elasticsearch instances can each index a subset of the data, and later be merged into a unified search space using remote _reindex operations. This approach maintains data integrity while allowing the system to scale beyond the limitations of individual nodes. 3.2.2 Parameter Tuning. The indexing operation relies on the elasticsearch.helpers.parallel_bulk function, which distributes bulk requests across multiple threads to enable concur- rent ingestion into Elasticsearch. Achieving good runtime and mem- ory performance requires careful tuning of several interdependent parameters, as poor settings can easily create CPU under-utilization, memory exhaustion, or request bottlenecks. Thread count determines the number of worker threads han- dling bulk requests. Each thread maintains its own request queue, which increases memory consumption proportionally. The value should not exceed the number of available CPU cores. Higher thread counts improve concurrency but also risk memory pressure if chunk sizes are large. Chunk size specifies the number of documents in each bulk request. Small chunks create more frequent bulk submissions, in- creasing overhead from request construction and processing inside Elasticsearch. Oversized chunks, on the other hand, increase mem- ory usage and the chance of timeouts. The maximum feasible chunk size is bounded by the ratio of max_chunk_size to avg_doc_size: \ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52\u2264\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65_\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54_\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 (1) Max chunk bytes controls the maximum payload size of a bulk request.

Queue size defines the buffer between the main thread (produc- ing chunks) and worker threads (processing them). A larger queue helps absorb temporary imbalances between production and con- sumption, but also increases memory footprint. In practice, values between 2 and 8 were tested. Parameter choices must therefore balance CPU parallelism, re- quest management overhead, and memory constraints. Estimating memory cost from avg_doc_size and bounding chunk size via max_chunk_size provides a practical starting point, after which empirical tuning is essential to reach stable throughput without exceeding hardware limits. Hardware considerations must also be taken in account, potentially providing an upper limit on docu- ment insertion speed. While Elasticsearch uses a two-phase atomic commit protocol for single document insertion it does not natively support bulk atomic transactions4, meaning that in a multi-threaded environment, each document insertion required two sequential round-trips to the storage for each inserted document. On well- optimized storage infrastructure such as ALPS IOPStore we used to indexing, this drive access latency can approach 50 microseconds, with expected maximal indexing speeds around 10 000 documents per second. This limit is determined by hardware latencies rather than document size or indexing settings. 3.2.3 Types of Queries. With Elasticsearch, one has the possibility to perform various types of queries. For instance, one can perform exact queries, fuzzy queries, or perform boolean logic with manually configured boolean queries. In this work, we focus on the match phrase query, which is described in more detail below. For this query, the system processes content using the web_content_analyzer, which performs: \u2022 HTML stripping to remove tags \u2022 Standard tokenization to split text into words \u2022 Lowercase normalization \u2022 ASCII folding to convert accented characters to plain letters The match_phrase_query searches for an exact sequence of words, with a configurable tolerance for how closely those words must appear together. This tolerance is controlled by the MATCH_PHRASE_SLOP parameter. For single-word queries, it behaves the same as a regular match query. For multi-word phrases such as \u201cclimate change,\u201d the terms must appear in the same order after analysis. When the slop value is set to 0, the words must occur directly next to each other. For example, \u201cclimat\u201d must immedi- ately precede \u201cchang.\u201d Increasing the slop allows a greater distance between words: a slop of 1 permits one intervening word, and a slop of 2 allows two. In practice, this means a slop of 1 can match \u201cclimate and change,\u201d while a slop of 2 can match \u201cclimate action and change.\u201d 3.3 Computing Environment and Resource Usage 3.3.1 Computing environment.

The experiments were conducted on the Alps Research Infrastructure at the Swiss National Supercom- puting Centre (CSCS). The large-scale high-performance computing 4https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-elasticsearch-as-nosql (HPC) system is an HPE Cray EX system with a HPL performance of 434 PFlops, making it one of the most powerful existing super- computers, sitting as the N 8 of Top 500 5. The system is equipped with Arm64-based NVIDIA Grace Hop- per GH200 nodes. Each node combines Grace CPUs with integrated Hopper GPUs, providing four Grace-Hopper modules and associ- ated network interfaces. In total, the system contains 10,752 nodes, with each node containing 4 GPUs and 4 CPU sockets. The storage includes a 100PB ClusterStor HDD system and a 3PB ClusterStor SSD system, alongside a 1PB VAST storage system. Sharing the architecture with the current top 1 system on the Green Top 500 list, Alps itself is highly energy-efficient, achieving 61 GFlops/watt and ranking 19th on that list6. Architecturally, Alps uses a software-defined cluster (vCluster), abstracting infrastructure, service management and user environ- ments, bridging the gap between traditional HPCs and Cloud ser- vice provider deployments. Specifically, the ML-dedicated vCluster, Clariden, is a container-first cluster using Slurm as scheduler [51] Elasticsearch version 7.17.28 was deployed in a distributed setup across multiple nodes. 3.3.2 Usage and emissions. We give an estimation of the CO2 emit- ted by the computation. In total, we used 7741 node hours for indexing and search presented here, including trial runs and pa- rameter tuning, totaling less than 0.1% of the computational power used to train the Apertus Model. We assume a power usage of 560W per node, consistent with Apertus training load, resulting in 4.3 MWh for the development and execution of the data indexing. While Alps\u2019 electric supply is carbon-neutral [54], by performing a consumption substitution analysis, we estimate that CO2 emis- sions per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Switzerland are on average 21g CO2eq/kWh, our work led to approximately 90kg CO2eq, or around 0.225% of the yearly emissions of an average Swiss person [5, 25]. 4 Elasticsearch Deployment Deploying Elasticsearch on high-performance computing (HPC) systems equipped with Grace Hopper nodes and Arm64 architec- tures presents several nontrivial challenges that do not arise in more conventional x86-based environments. A central difficulty lies in containerization. Many HPC platforms provide their own container engines, optimized for workload scheduling and security, but incompatible with Docker. This incompatibility reflects both architectural and security concerns: the majority of Docker im- ages target x86_64/amd64 rather than Arm64, and Docker\u2019s shared read/write permissions are unsuitable for multi-user HPC systems. As a result, the official Elasticsearch image and orchestration tools such as Docker Compose cannot be used. To overcome these limitations, we built custom OCI-compliant container images using Podman7. These images bundled the ap- propriate version of Elasticsearch together with supporting tools such as Python3, pyarrow, and curl, while remaining fully compat- ible with the Arm64 architecture and the HPC system\u2019s security model.

In an HPC environment, system-level restrictions can give fur- ther challenges. In our case, environment definition files, typically used to propagate configuration variables into containers, were not reliably interpreted by Elasticsearch. We addressed this by redirecting all runtime parameters through explicit command-line arguments injected at container startup. Similarly, Elasticsearch\u2019s reliance on memory mapping conflicted with the immutable ker- nel parameter vm.max_map_count, which was set too low on the cluster to satisfy bootstrap checks. We resolved this by disabling the memory mapping, enabling Elasticsearch to start successfully. However, the disadvantage is that due to the absence of memory mapping we observed a reduction in the I/O efficiency and a higher system memory usage. Last, networking required careful reconfiguration. In this HPC environment, HTTP traffic was subject to proxy mediation, lead- ing to unexpected failures when attempting to connect to Elastic- search\u2019s default endpoint on localhost:9200. We resolved this by explicitly bypassing the proxy for local traffic, binding all Elastic- search interfaces strictly to 127.0.0.1, and disabling multi-node dis- covery to comply with SLURM\u2019s job isolation model. These settings ensured stable single-node operation suitable for HPC workloads. 5 Performance Statistics We start by considering the indexing and search performance of Elastic Search on the Phase 1 training data, as described in Section 3.1.3. To this end, we perform three analyses. First, we look at the indexing statistics for each of the datasets. Then, we consider the effect of the query length on the search time. 5.1 Indexing Performance Table 4 displays the indexing statistics for each of the datasets de- scribed in Section 3.1.3. The indexing performance varies notably with the linguistic composition and content type. Indexing pure English text proceeds substantially faster than indexing a multi- lingual dataset comprising a variety of European languages. The throughput for English text reached 10,297 documents per second, whereas the multilingual dataset achieved only 589 documents per second. This difference likely arises from the higher linguistic", "and content type. Indexing pure English text proceeds substantially faster than indexing a multi- lingual dataset comprising a variety of European languages. The throughput for English text reached 10,297 documents per second, whereas the multilingual dataset achieved only 589 documents per second. This difference likely arises from the higher linguistic and computational complexity of multilingual data. English text is comparatively uniform in structure and encoding, with straightfor- ward tokenization, while multilingual corpora introduce additional processing overhead due to diverse character sets, diacritics, and language-specific normalization routines. Memory usage measurements show that the peak memory con- sumption is considerably higher when indexing code than when indexing natural language text. Code contains more unique tokens, longer identifiers, and complex syntactic patterns, which require larger intermediate data structures and less redundancy. As a result, code indexing demands greater memory resources. The index overhead also differs significantly between datasets. For pure English, the ratio between index size and raw data size is relatively low (1.3), whereas it significantly increases when multiple languages are included. This indicates that English text is more easily compressed and represented efficiently, while multilingual datasets require larger vocabularies and less compressible structures due to linguistic variability. Given that Fineweb-2-HQ was partially rehydrated for duplicated content, we verified if content de-duplication could be leveraged to compress the index size and accelerate the indexing on Fineweb-2 Europe High quality only. For this, we pre-computed full document SHA-256 hashes and inserted only the first document with the matching SHA-256 hash. Overall, we observed that approximately 68% was duplicates, with most replicated content containing up to 8 copies, consistent with Fineweb-2-HQ documentation. Rather than increase in indexing speed, we observed an indexing slow-down proportional to duplicated content prevalence (approximately 68%) lost in Fineweb-2 Europe High vs non-deduplicated Fineweb-2 Eu- rope Medium, cf Table 4. We interpret it as Elasticsearch managing duplicates internally with minimal overhead. 5.2 Query Length and Search Time In Figure 1 we evaluate the performance of match phrase queries when applied to an index with varying query segment length. To this end, for 13 different lengths between 1 and 300 words, we sam- pled 25 queries from the source datasets used to build the indexes. These segments were then issued as match phrase queries against the corresponding indexes to calculate the average search time and the standard deviation interval. We can observe a logical tendency of longer queries taking longer time, and get an intuition for overall performance.

In this section, we describe the analysis of the presence of harm- ful terms in the phase 1 training data of Apertus. To this end, we consider three Weaponized Words (WW), the manually constructed list of chemical warfare substances, and the LDNOOBW. Table 5 shows", "of offensive words outside context. In this section, we describe the analysis of the presence of harm- ful terms in the phase 1 training data of Apertus. To this end, we consider three Weaponized Words (WW), the manually constructed list of chemical warfare substances, and the LDNOOBW. Table 5 shows the number of documents that contain at least one of the terms in each dataset. As expected, the results show that in low- resource languages there is fewer presence of harmful content.

Furthermore, we observe that despite apparent high counts of problematic content, most highly represented words are general terms that may not always be problematic. These terms encompass general, important themes and cannot be universally removed from the training data without severely degrading models\u2019 performance, which is consistent with previous reports [11]. Driving this point further, despite the abundance of toxic words, Apertus performs well on toxicity evaluations [21] (Section 5.2, Table 26). However, full-text indexing enables fine-grained thematic analyses for granu- lar further training data filtering and LLM behavior guarantees. 6.1 Weaponized Words Figure 2 shows, for each of the languages taken into consideration, the five most prominent terms in the training data. We observe that there are common terms across different languages, such as \"dying\" (mourir, sterben) and \"killing\" (uccidere, toten). At the same time, there is a clear difference for the English language, in which terms related to sex are the most common in the training data. 6.2 Chemical Substances We observe that the counts are exceptionally high for common chemical compounds widely known to the general public, notably Glycerine, Nitric Acid, and Hydrogen Cyanide. In particular, most of their mentions would occur outside chemical weapons synthesis in- structions. We observe that for rare terms unequivocally connected to chemical weapons synthesis (Bromopicrin, Methyldichloroar- sine), substantial counts occur outside of English, indicating that multilingual data curation is essential to ensure model safety. Table 2 displays the most common find terms from the LD- NOOBW for each of the languages. Similar to Weaponized Words, we observe high counts of general words, which are necessary for discussing important topics. 7 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we demonstrate how a full-text search index for 8.6 T multilingual tokens can be built on modern energy-efficient infrastructure and how it can be leveraged to ensure LLM behavior safety.

We hope this will encourage future analyses of the LLM training data and the inclusion of full training data analysis in LLM release standards. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting index can be used for Language Top 3 terms Total count (x 1,000,000) English sex, sexual, sexually 251.9 French con, p\u00e9ter, bitte 189.6 German porno, penis, fick 6.6 Filipino bobo, tanga, burat 0.5 Kabyle qqu, abbuc, uqan 0.0001 Thai [H\u00af\u0131], [Y\u02d8ed], [Khwy] 0.2 Esperanto fik, pi\u02c6co, fek 3.0 Arabic [faraj], [nik], [aghtisabi] 0.4 Table 6: Top 3 most found terms from the LDNOOBW for each of the languages taken into consideration, alongside the total count for those three terms. Enclosure by [] indicates transliteration. in-depth investigation of problematic content in the LLM training data, allowing for fine-grained context-based analysis and training data cleaning. We hope that this will lead to a common adoption of training data-based LLM safety and security mechanisms, such as those proposed by other teams, notably in [39]. While our training data indexing is primarily motivated by safety and security, the size of the indexed data begins to approach that of the Common Crawl dataset itself. In turn, this suggests that an offline search index for the entire open internet is within reach for smaller entities. An exciting perspective in itself, it is particularly in- teresting for the general-purpose factual rooting of LLM generation based on offline search curated open web subsets. In turn, this raises a host of ethical and economic questions, notably regarding the fair compensation of individuals who originally created and hosted the retrieved content, likely opening novel research directions in worldwide web economic, legal, and governance aspects.

We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capac- ity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursive- ness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we inves- tigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language mod- els (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference\u2014neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our ex- periments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key general- ization barriers in neural reasoning systems. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural models have achieved substantial advancements at an accelerated pace in recent years. How- ever, they continue to face challenges in generalizing\u2014a capability that is crucial for tasks such as logical deduction. While they excel at pattern recognition, these models often struggle with the sys- tematicity and robustness required for sound reasoning (Marcus (2018); Lake et al. (2017); Huang & Chang (2023); Mondorf & Plank (2024)) This is particularly evident in their limited capacity to generalize beyond the training data, especially in tasks that demand a deep understanding of com- positional structures (Hupkes et al. (2023)). In this work, we focus on two fundamental and complementary aspects of generalization in the con- text of logical reasoning: compositionality and recursiveness. Compositionality (Janssen & Partee (1997)) refers to the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the mean- ing of its parts and the rules used to combine them \u2014the ability to abstract from complex structures to process simpler ones. Recursiveness, on the other hand, is the capacity to construct complex rep- resentations through the iterative application of a finite set of rules\u2014or the ability to build intricate representations through iterative composition of simpler elements. A simple syllogistic example illustrates this distinction. Consider the inference: \u201cif all a are b and all b are c, then all a are c.\u201d A system demonstrating recursiveness can extend this to \u201cif all a are b, all b are c, and all c are 1 arXiv:2510.09472v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint d, then all a are d.\u201d Compositional generalization requires", "a are b and all b are c, then all a are c.\u201d A system demonstrating recursiveness can extend this to \u201cif all a are b, all b are c, and all c are 1 arXiv:2510.09472v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint d, then all a are d.\u201d Compositional generalization requires the ability to understand that a simpler inference\u2014such as \u201cif all a are b and all b are c, then all a are c\u201d\u2014 is a valid component of both simple and more complex inferences. A system that is merely recursive might be able to produce longer chains, but a compositional system truly understands the structure of the argument and can reason about its sub-parts. It is possible for a model to be recursive (i.e., process arbitrarily long chains) without being compositional (i.e., without understanding the meaning of the individual links in the chain and how they combine). This lack of compositionality is a key limitation of current neural models (Vargas Guzm\u00b4an et al. (2024), Lake & Baroni (2023)) To investigate this issue, we examine the logical generalization capabilities of large pre-trained lan- guage models (LLMs) using syllogistic logic\u2014a well-defined, yet non-trivial, fragment of natural language that captures a fundamental aspect of human reasoning. Syllogistic logic was chosen as a clearly tractable baseline for compositional and recursive generalization, as logics that are too expressive\u2014such as full first-order logic\u2014are computationally intractable. We fine-tuned LLMs on two distinct reasoning tasks: (1) selecting a subset of premises to construct direct proofs, and (2) generating formulas that yield a contradiction, enabling indirect (reductio ad absurdum) proofs. These tasks were designed to probe different facets of logical generalization, with premise selection requiring an understanding of the relationships between statements and proof by contradiction test- ing the ability to reason about counterfactuals and derive logical consequences. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we trained and tested on multiple knowledge bases generated from controlled synthetic data, which incorporates pseudowords to avoid content bias (Bertolazzi et al. (2024)). Our exper- iments reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursive reasoning, they struggle with compositional generalization. Specifically, when trained on simpler inferences, LLMs can recognize analogous simple inferences across different knowledge bases and generalize to a certain extent to more complex inference patterns. However, models trained exclu- sively on complex inferences exhibit a substantial performance drop when required to identify the underlying simpler components. Moreover, we observed notable differences in performance and generalization across various types of reasoning. This finding highlights a critical gap: current neu- ral models, even large pre-trained ones, fail to generalize reliably across the spectrum of logical reasoning tasks.

Output: a proof \u25bdof H from KB. To address this limitation, we propose a new research program consisting of two elements. On the theoretical side, we aim to understanding how different reasoning building blocks interact with deep-learning model performance on generalization tasks. On the practical side, we develop a novel hybrid architecture (see Figure 1) that integrates the pattern-matching strengths of neural networks with the formal rigor and completeness of symbolic reasoning. In this framework, the neural com- ponent serves as an auxiliary to the symbolic prover, efficiently providing candidate premises and formulas to guide the search for proofs. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of the assistant on the symbolic prover with respect to time complexity (i.e., number of steps), we implemented a rel- atively straightforward non-deterministic prover. This synergistic approach aims to overcome the limitations of purely neural approaches by enforcing logical consistency and enabling systematic generalization. The key contributions of this work are: (1) A rigorous empirical demonstration that, despite their recursive capabilities, LLMs lack true compositionality, a crucial requirement for robust logical rea- soning. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing between these two properties in evaluations 2 Preprint of neural reasoning systems. (2) A hybrid approach that leverages neural networks for efficient inference (e.g., fast premise selection) while relying on symbolic reasoning to guarantee logical completeness and correctness. (3) A novel methodology, embodied in our Hybrid Model (HM), that effectively addresses the generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems, achieving a bal- ance between efficiency and logical soundness. This provides a pathway towards more reliable and trustworthy AI systems. 2 A SYLLOGISTIC PROOF SYSTEM We considered a syllogistic proof system based on Smiley (1973) to implement hybrid models. The formulas \u201cAll a are b\u201d, \u201cNo a are b\u201d, \u201cSome a are b\u201d, and \u201cSome a are not b\u201d correspond to the symbolic representations Aab, Eab, Iab, and Oab, respectively. Next, we formally define the syntax and semantics over a language that consists of four quantifier symbols Q = {A, E, I, O} and an infinite set of term symbols X = {a, b, c, . . .} denoted by lower-case letters (sometimes with subscripts). Syntax and Semantics Well-formed formulas are built as Aab, Eab, Iab, or Oab. An A-chain, denoted as Aa \u2212b, represents either the formula Aab or the sequence of two or more formulas Aac1, Ac1c2, . . . , Acn\u22121cn, Acnb (for n \u22651). In what follows, when we refer to a formula we mean a well-formed formula. Moreover, we use capital letters (e.g., F or H) to denote formulas, and capital calligraphic letters (e.g., KB, F or P) to denote sets of formulas, unless stated differently. The meaning of syllogistic formulas can be defined using set-theoretic relationships. Let the terms a and b denote non-empty subsets of an underlying set or universe, then Aab is true iff a \u2286b; Eab", "capital calligraphic letters (e.g., KB, F or P) to denote sets of formulas, unless stated differently. The meaning of syllogistic formulas can be defined using set-theoretic relationships. Let the terms a and b denote non-empty subsets of an underlying set or universe, then Aab is true iff a \u2286b; Eab is true iff a\u2229b = \u2205; Iab is true iff a\u2229b \u0338= \u2205; and Oab is true iff a \u0338\u2286b. A set of syllogistic formulas F is consistent if there exists an interpretation (i.e., an assignment of sets to terms) under which every F \u2208F is true. Note that Aab and Oab are contradictory, and the same about Iab and Eab. We denote the negation of a formula F as F, i.e., Aab = Oab, Oab = Aab, Iab = Eab, and Eab = Iab. Last but not least, I and E-formulas are symmetrical. That is, Iab and Iba have the same meaning, and so do Eab and Eba. Types of Syllogisms We define a syllogism as an inference from a set of premises (or knowl- edge base) to a conclusion. Unlike classical syllogisms, which typically involve two premises, we consider more complex inferences that may involve multiple premises connected through chains of A-formulas. Definition 1 (Inference). Let F be a set of formulas (premises) and let F be a formula (conclusion). We write F \u22a2F, to denote that F is derivable (or provable) from F, if there exists a formal proof of F from F. Definition 2 (Proof). The following is a mutually recursive definition to characterize formal proofs for a set of formulas using tree notation. A proof \u25bdis one of the following three types: (i) Trivial proof: every F \u2208F is a proof from F (i) F (ii) Rule-based proofs: the following four trees are proofs from F. Where \u25bd\u2032 and \u25bd\u2032\u2032 are proofs from F \u25bd\u2032 Aab \u25bd\u2032\u2032 Abc (r1) Aac \u25bd\u2032 Aab \u25bd\u2032\u2032 Ebc (r2) Eac \u25bd\u2032 Eba (r3) Eab \u25bd\u2032 Aba (r4) Iab (iii) Proof by contradiction: where \u25bd\u2032 is a proof from F \u222a{H} and \u25bd\u2032\u2032 is a proof from F. \u25bd\u2032 F \u25bd\u2032\u2032 F (iii) H 3 Preprint Soundness and Completeness The deductive system presented above is based on the framework developed by Smiley (1973). In this system, all formulas that are provable are true in all interpreta- tions (as established in Theorem 4), and conversely, all formulas that are true in all interpretations are derivable within the system (as demonstrated in Theorem 3). It therefore follows that the system is both sound and complete. Definition 3 (Minimal Inference). An inference F \u22a2F is minimal if for no proper subset F\u2032 \u228aF, it is the case that F\u2032 \u22a2F. Minimal inferences are essential to design a prover assistant, as they use only the necessary premises to derive a conclusion. Table 1 depicts all types of minimal syllogistic inferences, as out- lined in Vargas Guzm\u00b4an et al. (2024).

The general process is described in Algorithm 1 and consists of finding a proof (as in Definition 2) for H. The prover first tries to derive the hypothesis using proofs of types (i) and (ii) by calling the DERIVE function. If it does not succeed, it tries to prove H by contradiction, i.e., proof of type (iii), using the PBC function. If the hypothesis is valid, the prover returns the derivation steps. If, on the contrary, H is invalid, then the prover will exhaust all possibilities to derive it. Algorithm 1 Syllogistic Prover Input: A hypothesis H and a knowledge base KB. Output: A proof \u25bdof H from KB (if H is valid). 1: \u2206\u2190\u2205 \u25b7set of partial proofs \u2206\u22862F \u00d7 F \u00d7 ProofType 2: if DERIVE(H, KB) or PBC(H, KB) then 3: \u25bd\u2190GET STEPS(H, \u2206) \u25b7get partial proofs that derive H 4: return \u25bd 5: else 6: return false 7: end if Derive function The central component of the prover is the recursive function DERIVE, described in Algorithm 2. The function takes as input the knowledge base KB and the hypothesis H, and initially checks whether proof of type (i) can be directly applied (line 2). If the base case is not satisfied, the function attempts to derive H (line 5) by non-deterministically searching for a set of formulas F such that H follows from F by using rules of inference, i.e., proof of type (ii). This process is applied recursively to each F \u2208F, continuing until the base case is met or no further applicable rules and formula combinations are available. To prevent redundant computations and potential infinite loops, the algorithm is optimized by storing partial proofs as tuples whenever the base case is reached (lines 3 and 6). These stored derivations are reused if the same inputs are en- countered again. Additionally, the system tracks failed derivation attempts to avoid repeating them in subsequent searches. Nevertheless, this search process remains computationally demanding. This is particularly evident when constructing A-chains, where the algorithm conducts a non-deterministic search over formulas of the form Aab, generated using terms drawn from the knowledge base. In the worst case, this results in at most n!/(n \u22122)! attempts, where n denotes the number of distinct terms in the knowledge base. Proof by Contradiction Function The final component of the prover, denoted PBC, is specified in Algorithm 3. This function gets the same inputs as DERIVE, and it aims to prove the hypothesis H by contradiction by finding a formula F such that KB \u222a{H} \u22a2F \u2227F. The", "the knowledge base.

This function gets the same inputs as DERIVE, and it aims to prove the hypothesis H by contradiction by finding a formula F such that KB \u222a{H} \u22a2F \u2227F. The algorithm begins by generating all possible contradictory formula pairs (F, F) that can be constructed using the four quantifiers applied to all terms present in the knowledge base KB. It then iterates through these pairs in search of a contradiction (line 4).

Synthetic Data A knowledge base KB can be formally represented as an edge-labeled graph G = (V, E, \u03b3), where the set of vertices V are terms from the domain X and the set of formu- las correspond to the set of edges E \u2286{(u, v) | u, v \u2208V and u \u0338= v} along with a labeling function \u03b3 : E \u2192Q that maps edges to syllogistic quantifiers (see Figure 2 for an example). We produced synthetic knowledge bases by randomly generating graphs such that the resulting knowledge bases are consistent. Furthermore, we imposed the constraint that for every formula F derivable from a given knowledge base KB, there exists a unique subset P \u2286KB such that P \u22a2F is minimal. This property is critical for eliminating redundant derivations of the same hypothesis. We refer to such structures as non-redundant knowledge bases (see Appendix A.4.1 for more details). To convert these structured representations into natural language inputs, terms are replaced with artificially generated pseudowords, and formulas are rendered in textual form (see Figure 3). Models are trained and evaluated using multiple knowledge bases with varied term substitutions and", "as non-redundant knowledge bases (see Appendix A.4.1 for more details). To convert these structured representations into natural language inputs, terms are replaced with artificially generated pseudowords, and formulas are rendered in textual form (see Figure 3). Models are trained and evaluated using multiple knowledge bases with varied term substitutions and premise permutations, a data augmentation strategy that prevents memorization and improves generalization. Fine-Tuning LLMs We conducted experiments by fine-tuning two transformer-based architec- tures, FLAN-T5-base (Raffel et al. (2020)), an encoder-decoder model developed by Google AI, and GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI (2024)), a decoder-only model developed by OpenAI. Importantly, our goal is not to teach general reasoning through fine-tuning, but to adapt models for specific tasks\u2014 premise selection and proof by contradiction\u2014while improvements in reasoning skills may still arise. We therefore view our results as reflecting the overall reasoning capabilities of pre-trained 5 Preprint x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 x11 A A A A A A A A A E I O O O KB = {Ax1x2, Ax2x3, Ax3x4, Ax3x5, Ax6x7, Ax7x8, Ax7x9, Ax8x10, Ax9x11, Ex4x11, Ix1x8, Ox4x5, Ox5x3, Ox11x7} Inference examples from each type: (1) {Ax1\u2212x3, Ox5x3} \u22a2Ox5x1 (2) {Ax6\u2212x11} \u22a2Ax6x11 (3) {Ax2\u2212x4, Ax7\u2212x11, Ax7x8, Ex4x11} \u22a2Ox8x2 (4) {Ax7\u2212x10, Ax7\u2212x11} \u22a2Ix10x11 (5) {Ax1\u2212x4, Ax6\u2212x11, Ax8x10, Ex4x11, Ix8x1} \u22a2Ox10x6 (6) {Ax1\u2212x4, Ax6\u2212x11, Ex4x11} \u22a2Ex6x1 (7) {Ax1\u2212x4, Ax8x10, Ix8x1} \u22a2Ix4x10 Figure 2: Example of a knowledge base KB represented as a graph along with valid inferences that can be derived from KB. and fine-tuned models. In this setting, for both tasks the input consists of a complete knowledge base paired with a hypothesis to be proven, while the output depends on the task: in premise se- lection, it is the subset of premises required to derive the hypothesis; in proof by contradiction, it is a formula enabling a type (iii) derivation. In both cases, the models process inputs and produce outputs as plain text sequences. We investigate two dimensions of generalization in our framework: compositionality, the capacity to deconstruct complex structures into simpler components, and recursiveness, the ability to iteratively combine simpler structures to construct more complex ones. We operationalize these concepts by systematically excluding syllogisms with short and long A-chains during training and evaluating model performance on them exclusively at test time. More precisely, a model is said to exhibit compositional generalization if it can correctly infer syllogisms with shorter A-chains than those encountered during training. Conversely, it demonstrates recursive generalization if it successfully predicts syllogisms with longer A-chains than those used in training. To implement this evaluation, we excluded from the training set the five shortest and five longest A-chain lengths for each syllogism type. Data Specification To achieve satisfactory performance, we experimented with fine-tuning on varying numbers of knowledge bases and different proportions of the dataset, using 80% of the data for T5 and only 25% for GPT. While OpenAI suggests that small datasets may suffice for fine-tuning, our GPT models were trained on an average of 100 million tokens1, highlighting the necessity of large-scale data for robust model performance in logical reasoning tasks. We generated 30 distinct", "of the data for T5 and only 25% for GPT. While OpenAI suggests that small datasets may suffice for fine-tuning, our GPT models were trained on an average of 100 million tokens1, highlighting the necessity of large-scale data for robust model performance in logical reasoning tasks. We generated 30 distinct synthetic knowledge bases for fine-tuning and an additional 30 for evaluation purposes. On average, each knowledge base consists of 40 premises and 1333 valid hypothesis (see Table 2 for the mean number of hypothesis for each task categorized by syllogism type). To further assess the models\u2019 capacity for recursive generalization, we constructed an extra set of 60 knowledge bases, specifically designed to include a greater proportion of inferences involving longer A-chains, which are typically underrepresented. Furthermore, each knowledge base features unique pseudoword substitutions and random permutations of premises to enhance lexical diversity and reduce overfitting (see Table 3).

Table 4 presents the average accuracy across all evaluated knowl- edge bases for each experimental setting, using T5 and GPT architectures fine-tuned on premise selection and proof by contradiction tasks.2 The evaluation of overall models is conducted across three datasets, all, short, and long. The last two are subsets of the first one and correspond to the same tests performed for compositional and recursive models, respectively. A more comprehensive analysis is provided in Figure 4, which illustrates the accuracy of evaluated inferences across the five shortest and five longest unseen A-chain lengths. For a given syllogism of type t, we denote the shortest evaluated length as \u03c3(t) and the longest as \u00b5(t). Solid lines in the plot represent compositional and recursive models, while dashed lines depict overall models. Note that overlapping lines would imply a perfect generalization. The latter is visible in the recursive evaluation for the premise selection task (top-right plot). However, a slight drop in the accuracy occurs", "as \u00b5(t). Solid lines in the plot represent compositional and recursive models, while dashed lines depict overall models. Note that overlapping lines would imply a perfect generalization. The latter is visible in the recursive evaluation for the premise selection task (top-right plot). However, a slight drop in the accuracy occurs as the unseen lengths increase. The drop is more evident for the proof by contradiction task (bottom-right plot). This suggests that LLMs experience difficulties in generating long sequences of A-formulas, regardless of their presence during training. Compositional experiments, on the other hand, exhibit a poor generalization and a steeper curve towards the shortest length, in contrast to overall models that can generate inferences involving shorter A-chains almost perfectly. Models occasionally predict unnecessary premises that still lead to valid proofs; when such predic- tions are treated as correct, GPT exhibits a notable improvement in compositional generalization (see Appendix A.2 for details). Finally, cases in which the models fail to produce the correct answer are analyzed in Appendix A.3. Table 4: Accuracy scores for premise selection and proof by contradiction tasks (all experiments).

Analysis by Syllogism Type We analyzed these experiments on specific types of syllogism (Table 1). In the premise selection task, Type (2)\u2014the structurally simplest inference embedded within all other types\u2014consistently achieved the highest accuracy across all experimental settings, demon- strating near-perfect generalization, with the unique exception of GPT in the compositionality ex- periment. In contrast, Type (1) and Type (5) achieved the lowest accuracies for T5 across the gen- eralization tasks. For GPT, poor performance was observed only on Type (1). In the proof by contradiction task\u2014where Types (2) and (6) were not applicable\u2014Type (7) emerged as the best- performing inference type on both architectures, achieving a near-perfect generalization in the case of GPT. Overall, this task appeared to be easier for GPT than for T5, which, with few exceptions, struggled to generalize effectively. GPT, by contrast, demonstrated consistently strong performance across all inference types, including the particularly challenging Type (1) (see Appendix A.1 for more details). 5 HYBRID MODELS EVALUATION To construct a hybrid model, we employed the same algorithms described in Section 3; however, the search processes are guided by inputs generated by the", "contrast, demonstrated consistently strong performance across all inference types, including the particularly challenging Type (1) (see Appendix A.1 for more details). 5 HYBRID MODELS EVALUATION To construct a hybrid model, we employed the same algorithms described in Section 3; however, the search processes are guided by inputs generated by the assistants (neural models). In the case of Algorithm 2, rather than exhaustively exploring all formulas derivable from the knowledge base KB, the hybrid model restricts its search to a subset P \u2286KB which is predicted by the premise selection assistant. Similarly, in Algorithm 3 (line 3), the search for contradictory formula pairs (F, F) is initiated using candidates suggested by the proof by contradiction assistant. We investigated three variants of hybrid models, each incorporating neural components trained under different generalization regimes\u2014namely, overall, compositional, and recursive\u2014 and evaluated their performance relative to a purely symbolic baseline to assess the impact of the neural assistants. Data Distribution We randomly selected just over 2000 samples from 30 distinct knowledge bases within the test dataset. From each knowledge base, we selected 10 syllogisms of each type, compris- 8 Preprint Figure 5: Geometric mean and standard deviation of the number of steps for the Symbolic and Hybrid models, using different assistants trained on GPT and T5. OVE, COM, and REC denote overall, compositional, and recursive models, respectively. ing 5 instances featuring longer A-chains and 5 with shorter A-chains. To ensure a sufficient level of inference complexity, we excluded trivial proofs by retaining only those syllogisms in which the A-chains length is greater than or equal to 2. Evaluation Methodology To assess the efficiency of the hybrid models, we measured the num- ber of steps required to complete the proof of a valid hypothesis, where each step corresponds to a single invocation of the recursive function DERIVE by the prover. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the symbolic component, each experiment is executed five times for each model configu- ration. Moreover, we use logarithmic notation and the geometric mean\u2014due to the potentially wide variability\u2014 to represent step counts (see Figure 5). On average, the symbolic model requires approximately 105.7 steps to complete a proof. In contrast, hybrid models require substantially fewer steps. In particular, models incorporating overall and recursive neural assistants, exhibit comparable performance, and they need only around 102.4 steps across both LLM architectures. This corresponds to a reduction of approximately three orders of magnitude. Hybrid configurations assisted by compositional models require slightly more steps, approximately 102.7 for the GPT-based model and 103.1 for the T5-based model. This outcome is not unexpected, as they exhibit a drop in accuracy relative to their overall and recursive counterparts. However, their use in hybrid configurations does not result in a significant increase in derivation steps, indicating robustness when assisting the prover. 6 CONCLUSIONS Our main findings focus on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their role in assisting automated provers. From a semantic perspective, LLMs struggle to fully grasp logical reasoning.

From a semantic perspective, LLMs struggle to fully grasp logical reasoning. Our generalization experiments highlight a significant gap between recursiveness and compositionality, indicating a need for a deeper theoretical understanding of this issue. Additionally, we observed notable differences in performance and generalization across various types of reasoning. These findings open up a research agenda aimed at understanding how different reasoning building blocks interact with deep learning model performance on generalization tasks. Future research should explore increasingly complex fragments of logic, where the interactions between various inference building blocks and reasoning forms become even more fascinating. We consider a relatively small encoder\u2013decoder model (T5), chosen for its efficiency and strong overall performance on our tasks, alongside a substantially larger decoder-only model (GPT), se- lected to evaluate a state-of-the-art LLM (see Appendix A.4.2 for details). GPT shows greater efficiency, converging with less data, though both models achieve comparable performance. This suggests that scaling to larger models alone may not be sufficient to overcome the challenges posed by these reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that neither the limitations in gen- 9 Preprint eralization nor model size prevent LLMs from effectively assisting symbolic provers. On the con- trary, this assistance fosters a collaborative relationship between connectionist and symbolic models. While connectionist models can simplify and expedite tasks, symbolic models can still complete them when necessary, making hybrid models an important area for further investigation. This study focuses on syllogistic logic\u2014a simple fragment of natural language\u2014laying the ground- work for future work on the theoretical relationship between generalization and logical complexity. Subsequent investigations will explore richer fragments, e.g., Pratt-Hartmann (2004) or suitable fragments of modal logic. Our modular approach to hybrid models could provide practical solutions for developing computationally efficient provers for these logics, forming part of a broader effort to determine where the boundary of tractability lies for neural and neuro-symbolic reasoners.

Notably, in all such cases, the models consistently generated well-formed formulas. Therefore, the observed errors can be attributed to the incorrect selection or construction of syllogistic formulas, rather than to syntactic malformation. To evaluate semantic errors in the premise selection task, we considered three key aspects: (1) whether the terms appearing in the hypothesis were also present in the predicted premises, which would indicate a basic understanding of syllogistic rules; (2) whether the predicted premises were sourced from the knowledge base; and (3) whether the terms within the predicted premises were restricted to those found in the knowledge base. These latter checks ensure that models are not generating fabricated content. Table A9 presents a summary of semantic validity by reporting the proportion of cases, across all experiments, in which each criterion was satisfied for both T5 and GPT models. These proportions were calculated relative to the set of incorrect predictions. Remarkably, the results indicate that the models generate fabricated premises. A closer analysis suggests", "summary of semantic validity by reporting the proportion of cases, across all experiments, in which each criterion was satisfied for both T5 and GPT models. These proportions were calculated relative to the set of incorrect predictions. Remarkably, the results indicate that the models generate fabricated premises. A closer analysis suggests that this issue may stem from confusion between syllogisms whose hypotheses share the same formula type\u2014specifically, among O-formulas in inference types (1), (3), and (5), and among I-formulas in types (4) and (7). That is, the models appear to erroneously construct an incorrect type of syllogism, thereby generating fabricated premises in an attempt to force a valid inference. Similarly, in the proof by contradiction task, all incorrect predictions were syntactically well-formed. While the criteria concerning term overlap with the hypothesis and the validity of premises are not directly applicable in this setting, it is noteworthy that, in all instances, the terms used in the incorrectly predicted formulas were contained within the vocabulary of the knowledge base. A.4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP All experiments were implemented in Python, with TensorFlow as the primary deep learning frame- work. The implementation also made use of several additional libraries: Hugging Face\u2019s Trans- formers for model loading and fine-tuning; NumPy and Pandas for numerical operations and data manipulation; json and jsonlines for data formatting; os, random, and itertools for file handling and data sampling; and matplotlib and pydot for visualization and graph rendering. A.4.1 KNOWLEDGE BASE GENERATION The process began with the construction of knowledge bases, represented as graph-like structures (see Figure 2). To introduce variability in the data, we focus on two main factors: the number of sub- graphs, each corresponding to a tree structure that encodes A-formulas, and the maximum length of an A-chain within a single subgraph. For both fine-tuning and evaluation, we generated two distinct types of knowledge bases, which were evenly distributed throughout the dataset: those comprising 4 subgraphs, each with a maximum A-chain length of 5; and those consisting of 2 subgraphs, with maximum A-chain lengths ranging from 7 to 10. Finally, although it is not feasible for a single knowledge base to evenly represent every syllogism type, we ensured that each structure contains a sufficient number of instances for each inference type. 13 Preprint Table A10: Data distribution by syllogism type and A-chain length (train/validation split) Length (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Total 0 6390 \u2013 2400 \u2013 \u2013 2400 2400 13590 1 9060 28800 4800 57600 30 4800 6180 111270 2 10170 25440 8370 66720 210 7140 10260 128310 3 9510 21540 11700 67920 570 9060 15180 135480 4 8430 16770 15480 65700 990 10620 17940 135930 5 6300 11910 18780 57120 1830 11580 20220 127740 6 4560 7530 20610 44280 2580 10920 19320 109800 7 2700 4620 21420 30480 3090 9960 17820 90090 8 1380 1290 20790 17940 3420 8160 15420 68400 9 570 570 18900 8820 3720 6420 12900 51900 10 210 150 16140 4800 3930 4620 8880 38730 11 60 \u2013 12960 1560 3420 3060 2760 23820 12 30 \u2013 10170 540 2940 2220 1380 17280", "30480 3090 9960 17820 90090 8 1380 1290 20790 17940 3420 8160 15420 68400 9 570 570 18900 8820 3720 6420 12900 51900 10 210 150 16140 4800 3930 4620 8880 38730 11 60 \u2013 12960 1560 3420 3060 2760 23820 12 30 \u2013 10170 540 2940 2220 1380 17280 13 \u2013 \u2013 7650 120 2520 1500 600 12390 14 \u2013 \u2013 5460 \u2013 2040 900 240 8640 15 \u2013 \u2013 3570 \u2013 1560 480 60 5670 16 \u2013 \u2013 2130 \u2013 1140 300 \u2013 3570 17 \u2013 \u2013 1230 \u2013 690 120 \u2013 2040 18 \u2013 \u2013 510 \u2013 300 \u2013 \u2013 810 19 \u2013 \u2013 210 \u2013 120 \u2013 \u2013 330 20 \u2013 \u2013 90 \u2013 30 \u2013 \u2013 120 Total 59370 118620 203370 423600 35130 94260 151560 1085910 Table A11: Data distribution by syllogism type and A-chain length (test split for overall and com- positional models) Length (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Total 1 630 2847 240 5694 15 240 240 9906 2 879 2487 480 6528 48 480 672 11574 3 954 2034 822 6444 90 678 1188 12210 4 897 1608 1176 6036 162 822 1656 12357 5 753 1185 1512 5202 243 912 1890 11697 6 585 798 1776 4116 285 930 1926 10416 7 444 537 1902 3030 291 870 1818 8892 8 324 240 1929 1908 309 828 1686 7224 9 183 138 1842 1146 330 714 1506 5859 10 99 60 1686 666 318 588 1194 4611 11 60 \u2013 1443 252 327 456 912 3450 12 33 \u2013 1215 120 294 348 660 2670 13 15 \u2013 1005 42 255 258 372 1947 14 \u2013 \u2013 801 \u2013 216 192 198 1407 15 \u2013 \u2013 603 \u2013 189 138 84 1014 16 \u2013 \u2013 405 \u2013 159 84 42 690 17 \u2013 \u2013 264 \u2013 120 54 \u2013 438 18 \u2013 \u2013 150 \u2013 93 24 \u2013 267 19 \u2013 \u2013 78 \u2013 57 \u2013 \u2013 135 20 \u2013 \u2013 30 \u2013 30 \u2013 \u2013 60 21 \u2013 \u2013 15 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 15 Total 5856 11934 19374 41184 3831 8616 16044 106839 14 Preprint Table A12: Data distribution by syllogism type and A-chain length (test split for recursive models) Length (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Total \u00b5(t) \u22124 609 2451 1107 4410 549 750 2958 12834 \u00b5(t) \u22123 408 1806 684 2544 444 534 2196 8616 \u00b5(t) \u22122 237 1245 348 1008 306 348 1446 4938 \u00b5(t) \u22121 111 765 177 444 165 192 756 2610 \u00b5(t) 42 360 63 168 63 84 288 1068 Total 1407 6627 2379 8574 1527 1908 7644 30066 A.4.2 FINE-TUNING STRATEGY We conducted preliminary experiments to determine the number of knowledge bases and data pro- portions that maximize accuracy in the overall setting (i.e., when training includes all A-chain lengths) across both tasks: premise selection and proof by contradiction.

The most effective con- figuration consisted of 30 graph-based knowledge bases, of which 27 were used for training and 3 for validation. Each base structure was further augmented through substitution with 10 distinct pseudoword sets and presented in 3 different premise orderings. This augmentation process resulted in a total of 900 knowledge bases. A summary of the overall data distribution is provided in Table A10. Finally, we applied a stratified sampling approach to select a proportion of the dataset, based on inference type and A-chain length. For the T5 models, a proportion of 80% was found to be optimal. Fine-tuning was performed for one epoch using the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 20. We also explored the effect of different dataset proportions for fine-tuning the GPT models. The results revealed two key findings: first, using only 25% of the data was sufficient to match the performance of the T5 models; second, increasing the proportion to 80% resulted in only marginal performance gains. Therefore, we opted to use the smaller dataset. All GPT models were fine-tuned for one epoch, using a learning rate multiplier of 1.8. Batch sizes, ranging up to 128, were automatically selected by the API based on the dataset size. The fine-tuning process was performed three times for the T5 model and twice for GPT. In each case, the model achieving the highest accuracy was selected for subsequent experiments with the symbolic prover. Pseudoword Handling and OpenAI Moderation Constraints During the initial stages of model fine-tuning, we encountered challenges related to the use of pseudowords and the OpenAI Modera- tion API. Although the pseudowords were intentionally meaningless and devoid of semantic content, a significant number of training examples were flagged for violating OpenAI\u2019s usage policies\u2014 specifically under the category of hate speech\u2014which resulted in the training files being blocked. To resolve this, we introduced delimiters (e.g., \u201c{\u201d and \u201c}\u201d) to explicitly mark pseudowords. Inter- estingly, this restriction applied only during training; the API imposed no such limitations during evaluation. Evaluation Settings We evaluated the fine-tuned models on a set of unseen knowledge bases. To assess the overall and compositional models, we generated 30 distinct structures. Additionally, to address the underrepresentation of syllogisms involving longer A-chain lengths, we constructed an extra set of 60 knowledge bases to include the five longest A-chain lengths across all inference types, with the aim of evaluating the recursive models. Each structure was instantiated using three distinct sets of pseudowords. Notably, testing across different pseudoword orderings yielded iden- tical results. Therefore, our evaluation excludes permutations of premises.

To handle diverse business requirements and enable agentic capabilities, these LLM-based systems often rely on predefined policies, which specify instructions such as model metadata, response styles, and tool-using rules. These policies, typically implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, posing challenges for models in faithfully fol- lowing them. Moreover, they impose a large fixed computational cost regardless of the input query. As multimodal conversational agents emerge, complex policies that govern multimodal tasks and even involve visual instructions are becoming increasingly necessary, yet they have been rarely studied in previous work. In particular, prior work on prompt compression has focused solely on reducing the length of task templates and demonstrations, which require limited reasoning com- pared to policies. Meanwhile, related work on policy alignment has been limited to internalizing text-only safety instructions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that aims to internalize reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into the parameters of a large multimodal model, enabling stronger policy-following behavior without requiring the policy to be included in-context during inference. MPI presents unique challenges from both data and algorithmic perspectives. We construct two new datasets that cover complex decision-making and tool-using tasks across both synthetic and real-world visual inputs. We investigate diverse internalization strategies and propose a novel three-stage training framework, TriMPI, which enables stronger guidance from the original policy during internalization. Specifically, we first introduce a contin- ual pretraining stage before supervised finetuning, which directly injects policy knowledge into the model. We then propose PolicyRollout, a simple yet effective extension to GRPO-style RL algorithms, which enables more grounded exploration by augmenting the rollout space with policy-aware responses. We show significant improvements of TriMPI over strong baselines in end-to-end performance, general- ization capability, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we aim to build a strong foundation for future research by providing datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations. Code and data will be made publicly available for research purposes.

To manage diverse business rules and enable agentic functionality, these LLM-based systems often rely on predefined policies, which are structured instructions that specify model metadata, response styles, tool-usage rules, and more. These poli- cies, typically provided as in-context prompt prefixes, are becoming increasingly long and complex (estimated to range from \u223c1K to \u223c50K tokens*), imposing a substantial fixed computational cost re- gardless of the query size. In contrast, typical user queries usually range from 50 to 200 tokens (Clark *Exact numbers are not disclosed due to the proprietary nature of system prompts. 1 arXiv:2510.09474v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint Response not faithfully following policy Complex Policy", "substantial fixed computational cost re- gardless of the query size.

Figure 1: Motivation of the proposed Multimodal Policy Internalization task. The goal is to enhance the policy-following abilities of a large multimodal model without requiring the policy to be provided in-context during inference, thereby improving both performance and efficiency. et al., 2025), leading to a 20\u00d7 to 250\u00d7 higher input token cost from the policy prompts compared with the actual user queries. Moreover, as these policies expand and become more reasoning-intensive (e.g., requiring the model to follow rules distributed across different sections), models often struggle to adhere to them consistently (Yao et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2024). A natural research question arises: can we internalize the knowledge of policies into the model parameters while also improving the model\u2019s policy-following abilities? Previous research on prompt compression (Li et al., 2024) has shown initial success in reducing token usage through hard prompting (Li et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023), soft prompting (Mu et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023), or progressive fine-tuning (Zou et al., 2024). However, these approaches primarily focus on compressing templates and demonstration examples, which require minimal reasoning. More recent work (Guan et al., 2024) introduced deliberative alignment, which aims to internalize knowledge of more complex safety specifications and emphasizes improving policy- following performance beyond token reduction. Nonetheless, it remains limited to issues of model trustworthiness and has been explored only in text-only models. With the growing trend of multimodal conversational agents, policies are increasingly tied to multimodal tasks and may even include visual instructions such as demo images. Yet, no prior work has explored how to learn and internalize complex policies in multimodal models. To address this gap, we propose a new task, Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), which aims to train multimodal models that can generate policy-compliant responses without requiring the policy to be included in-context. Compared with prior work, the MPI task introduces several unique challenges: (1) The target policies focus on reasoning-intensive multimodal tasks, such as decision-making and tool usage for conversational agents. (2) There is a lack of existing datasets containing multimodal question-answer pairs that adhere to predefined policies. (3) There is a lack of established training paradigms for internalizing multimodal policies. For example, some text-only knowledge injection methods, such as continual pretraining (Ovadia et al., 2025; Maini et al., 2024), may not be directly applicable to MPI due to the presence of visual tokens. In this work, we contribute from both data and algorithmic perspectives to advance research in multimodal policy internalization. We first construct two new datasets, ClevrPolicy and GTAPolicy, to support training and evaluation", "Maini et al., 2024), may not be directly applicable to MPI due to the presence of visual tokens.

Specifically, ClevrPolicy focuses on internalizing complex decision-making policies that require multi-hop reasoning. Built upon the synthesized CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2017), ClevrPolicy provides flexible control over policy complexity and dataset size, enabling in-depth investigation of the effectiveness of different algorithms. Curated from the GTA dataset (Wang et al., 2024a), GTAPolicy targets multimodal tool-usage instructions with real-world images and user queries. GTAPolicy emphasizes a low-data regime, where only limited question-answering data is available to demonstrate the expected behavior. From the method perspective, a key challenge lies in how to align the response with the policy without assuming its existence during inference. Prior methods (Zou et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024) focus solely on learning policy-following behavior, leaving it unclear how to better leverage the policy context itself as guidance during training. To address this, we introduce a novel three-stage training framework, TriMPI, which incorporates two key ideas: (1) warming up the model through continual pretraining directly on the policy context; and (2) a new RL algorithm, PolicyRollout, which enables additional conditioning on the policy context without introducing a gap between training and inference. Specifically, TriMPI consists of a visually-masked continual pretraining (VM-CPT) stage, a chain-of-thought supervised finetuning (CoT-SFT) stage, and a reinforcement 2 Preprint Condition 1.1: check if there is any small object Condition 1.2: check if there is any rubber object No ... ...

Right: Example input-output pair corresponding to the policy. The policy is available only during training and not during inference. learning (RL) stage with PolicyRollout. The VM-CPT stage enables language modeling directly on the multimodal policy, thereby explicitly injecting the entirety of the policy knowledge into the model and facilitating reasoning in later stages. The RL stage is essential for internalizing reasoning- intensive policies, as it enables the model to learn from a broader range of policy-related responses through trail-and-error rather than memorization. PolicyRollout further enhances RL exploration by augmenting the rollout space with policy-grounded responses, serving as a simple yet effective extension to GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) and DAPO (Yu et al., 2025). We demonstrate that TriMPI yields significant improvements in MPI, approaching 70.7% and 79.4% absolute gains over CoT SFT baseline and in-context setting, respectively. Beyond end-task perfor- mance, we also demonstrate enhanced generalization capability to policy updates and robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Further analysis shows that the improvements of TriMPI are consis- tent across different policy complexities and model sizes, with more pronounced gains observed on complex policies. To summarize, our main contributions are threefold: (1) a new task that targets the internalization of complex policies in the multimodal domain; (2) two new datasets that support both analytical and real-world training and evaluation; and (3) a new training algorithm that introduce an effective training paradigm with a customized RL algorithm for policy internalization. 2 PROBLEM FORMULATION We formally define the proposed task, Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), as illustrated in Figure 1. Consider a multimodal conversational agentic task, where, given an input text query Q and visual inputs I, the expected output is a textual response A, which can be either free-form natural language or structured code for tool calling. Additionally, the response behavior should follow the instructions predefined in a policy context P. Note that the policy may include both textual PT and visual PI components. Let M\u03b8 denote a multimodal model parameterized by \u03b8. The following illustrates the expected inputs and outputs before and after internalization: A = M\u03b8(Q, I, P) Policy Internalization \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b8 A = M\u03b8(Q, I) (1) The goal is to embed the knowledge of the policy into the model parameters \u03b8, enabling better policy-compliant generation without requiring P in-context during inference. MPI shares the same high-level motivation as deliberative alignment (Guan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025), where we emphasize improving models\u2019 alignment with the policy beyond compressing the prompt. We do not consider training additional special embeddings as in soft prompting, since they are inherently tied to specific tasks (Li & Liang, 2021; Patel et al., 2025) and therefore limit the model\u2019s ability to maintain general reasoning capabilities and robustness (Fan et al., 2025; Bailey et al., 2023). 3 Preprint ### Tool Descriptions ### Type: Calculator Name Versions: Calculator Description: A calculator tool.

ClevrPolicy is built upon images and scene graphs from the Clevr dataset (Johnson et al., 2017), enabling fine-grained control over policy complexity and supporting comprehensive evaluation of different MPI algorithms. Here, policy complexity refers to how difficult it is to follow the instructions in the policy when it is provided in-context. To construct the policies, we generate binary decision trees in which decision nodes specify visual conditions and response nodes define actions, with tree depth determining complexity. Each decision tree is then converted into a structured natural language instruction as the final policy. We provide two variants of ClevrPolicy: ClevrPolicy-T, where policies are purely text-based, and ClevrPolicy-M, where policies include image demonstra- tions as part of the decision node conditions. Figure 2 illustrates the policy creation process and shows an input-output example. Further details are provided in Appendix C.1. 3.2 GTAPOLICY DATASET We further introduce GTAPolicy, which focuses on complex tool-using policies with real-world images and queries. We particularly consider a low-data regime, reflecting a common practical challenge in real-world settings where only limited QA pairs are available for training. The policy in GTAPolicy is constructed from the GTA dataset (Wang et al., 2024a), containing tool descriptions for 13 tools and 24 tool-calling rules with versioning and user-conditional mechanisms to simulate real-world business constraints. The policy can be automatically expanded when additional tools are provided. Training data reformulates multi-turn interactions into single-turn tool-calling tasks, where each instance includes visual inputs, a user profile, a query, an interaction history, and an instruction prompt, with the expected output being a JSON-formatted tool call specifying tool name and arguments. Figure 3 illustrates the policy and an input-output example in GTAPolicy. Further details on the GTAPolicy dataset are provided in Appendix C.2. The statistics and evaluation metrics for both datasets are presented in Table 6 and Appendix C.3, respectively. 4 Preprint TriMPI (ours) VM-CPT CoT SFT RL w/ PolicyRollout Query Answer CoT Query Answer CoT Policy Query Response Img Query Answer CoT Next Token Prediction Loss Policy Gradient Loss Loss Masking Query Answer Direct SFT CoT SFT Policy Figure 4: Overview of different training algorithms for multimodal policy internalization. The solid purple outlines indicate the parts where the next-token prediction loss is computed. On the right, we illustrate the proposed three-stage training strategy, TriMPI, which enables direct policy knowledge injection through the VM-CPT stage and policy-grounded reinforcement learning through PolicyRollout. The PolicyRollout algorithm is detailed in \u00a74.3 and illustrated in Figure 5. 3.3 ZERO-SHOT IN-CONTEXT RESULTS ON CLEVRPOLICY AND GTAPOLICY We conduct an in-context evaluation on the proposed two benchmarks using off-the-shelf models, where the policy is directly inserted into the inference prompt. This evaluation provides a useful reference for assessing the complexity of the policies. The in-context performance also provides guidance on which methods to rely on for generating chain of thought (CoT) data for MPI. As shown in Table 1, on ClevrPolicy, performance decreases as the layer number increases. Even the strongest model, such as Claude-4 (Anthropic, 2025), begins to struggle at N=6 particularly on ClevrPolicy-M. GTAPolicy also", "provides guidance on which methods to rely on for generating chain of thought (CoT) data for MPI. As shown in Table 1, on ClevrPolicy, performance decreases as the layer number increases. Even the strongest model, such as Claude-4 (Anthropic, 2025), begins to struggle at N=6 particularly on ClevrPolicy-M. GTAPolicy also poses significant challenges for all models, with the best tool accuracy only at 60%. 4 MULTIMODAL POLICY INTERNALIZATION (MPI) ALGORITHMS 4.1 BASELINES Inspired by previous work on prompt compression (Zou et al., 2024) and deliberative alignment (Guan et al., 2024) in text domains, we consider the following baseline methods for MPI. Direct SFT. We directly train on the non-CoT data using supervised finetuning (SFT), aiming to learn a mapping from the input to the answer without performing intermediate reasoning. CoT SFT. We first obtain chain-of-thought (CoT) data in which the model explicitly reasons over the rules in the policy before producing the final answer, and then perform SFT on this CoT data. To generate CoT data for ClevrPolicy and GTAPolicy, we adopt different approaches depending on task complexity and data availability. Further details are provided in Appendix D. 4.2 TRIMPI: A THREE-STAGE TRAINING STRATEGY FOR MPI We observe a key limitation in the baseline methods: they focus solely on learning the expected behavior without direct access to the original policy. This limitation becomes more evident for complex policies, where directly learning output patterns is increasingly difficult. This raises the following question: can we better augment the learning process with the policy, without introducing a gap between training and inference? Empirically, we find that simply inserting the policy into the prompt during training but removing it during inference results in near-random performance. To address this challenge, we propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework that (1) warms up the model via continual pretraining on the original policy, and (2) introduces PolicyRollout, a new RL algorithm enables more policy-aware explorations (detailed in \u00a74.3). TriMPI consists of three stages: (1) Visually-Masked Continual Pretraining (VM-CPT); (2) Super- vised Finetuning with Chain-of-thought (CoT SFT); (3) Reinforcement learning (RL). The CoT SFT stage is identical to the baseline described in \u00a74.1. We present the details on the VM-CPT and RL stage next. An illustration of the baselines and TriMPI stages is presented in Figure 4. 5 Preprint Policy Model ...

During the rollout phase, we additionally construct a set of input instances with the policy included in-context. These policy-aware responses are added to the rollout space as if they were generated from the original inputs without the policy in-context. The advantage and policy gradient are then computed on the combined rollouts, indicated by the thick red outlines. PolicyRollout enables more policy- aware exploration without introducing a gap between training and inference, leading to significant improvements in MPI, especially on complex policies. VM-CPT Stage.", "original inputs without the policy in-context. The advantage and policy gradient are then computed on the combined rollouts, indicated by the thick red outlines. PolicyRollout enables more policy- aware exploration without introducing a gap between training and inference, leading to significant improvements in MPI, especially on complex policies. VM-CPT Stage. This stage aims to inject policy knowledge directly into the model parameters before performing SFT. Specifically, we construct a new variant of the CoT dataset D, which contains input-output sequences x = (PT , PI, I, Q, C, A) defined as the concatenation of tokens from the policy P = (PT , PI), the visual inputs I, the text query Q, the CoT reasoning C, and the final answer A. We then compute the next-token prediction loss over all tokens except the visual tokens. L(\u03b8) = \u2212Ex\u223cD \" 1 PT t=1 mt T X t=1 mt log p\u03b8(xt | x<t) # , mt = 1[xt /\u2208PI \u222aI]. (2) The visual masking mt enables us to adopt CPT (Ovadia et al., 2025; Maini et al., 2024) in this multimodal domain, where continuous visual tokens may appear in both the input I and the policy PI, and it has shown empirical success despite its simplicity. RL Stage. As the target policy becomes more complex and reasoning-intensive, SFT baselines face the challenge of insufficient coverage of policy-related behaviors, particularly in low-data regimes. Inspired by recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which can effectively learn from negative samples and exploration, we investigate its effectiveness for the MPI task. We first adopt GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) and DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), following a standard response format and reward design. Specifically, we ask the model to generate a thinking block enclosed within <think></think> and an answer block enclosed within \\boxed{}, on which we compute both a format reward and an accuracy reward (detailed in Appendix C.3). From our initial experiments, we observe that although GRPO and DAPO yield substantial empirical gains, exploration in the RL stage remains insufficiently grounded in the policy. This limitation becomes more pronounced with complex policies, where ungrounded exploration rarely produces positive rewards. Simply adding the policy in-context during training is ineffective, since the model lacks access to the policy at inference time, introducing a misalignment between training and inference. In the next section, we present our solution through a modified rollout phase. 4.3 POLICYROLLOUT (PORO): POLICY-AWARE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING To further improve the effectiveness of the RL stage for MPI, we introduce PolicyRollout (PoRo), a simple yet effective extension to GRPO-style algorithms that augments the rollout space with policy-aware responses. Specifically, during the rollout stage, for each sampled instance, we construct a variant by inserting the policy in-context. We then allow the current policy model to generate an additional set of responses conditioned on the query Q, the image I, and the policy 6 Preprint Table 2: Main results and ablations on multimodal policy internalization performance.

By default, we use Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the base model. PoRo refers to PolicyRollout. The metrics are reported as percentages (%) and are detailed in Appendix C.3. We observe significant improvements of TriMPI over in-context and SFT baselines. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate the importance of each stage and the effectiveness of PolicyRollout. The RL steps indicate the actual update steps (for the three datasets, respectively, separated by \u201c|\u201d). Early stopping (marked with \u201c*\u201d) may occur in DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) runs due to its dynamic sampling strategy. Notably, on DAPO, TriMPI achieves competitive or stronger performance while using fewer steps.

Note that the policy gradient is applied only to the no-policy path (conditioning solely on Q and I), thereby ensuring that the training and inference remain aligned. 5 EXPERIMENTS We conduct comprehensive experiments on multimodal policy internalization, evaluating MPI task performance (\u00a75.1), generalization capability (\u00a75.2), policy knowledge injection (\u00a75.3), and robustness to catastrophic forgetting (\u00a75.4). By default, we use Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the base model. We tune all model parameters in the VM-CPT and RL stages, and apply LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) finetuning in the SFT stage. For ClevrPolicy, we use the most complex policies (N = 6) unless otherwise specified. Additional implementation details are provided in Appendix B. 5.1 MAIN RESULTS MPI Task Performance. In Table 2, we present evaluation results on ClevrPolicy and GTAPolicy in terms of task performance. Our best-performing model achieves up", "stage.

Our best-performing model achieves up to 70.7% and 79.4% absolute gains in accuracy over the CoT SFT baseline and the in-context setting, respectively. We also find that the relative superiority of GRPO and DAPO varies across datasets: DAPO performs better on ClevrPolicy, while GRPO excels on GTAPolicy. We hypothesize that this difference arises because DAPO makes bolder updates due to the removal of the reference KL. This leads to faster learning on ClevrPolicy, which contains more abundant and diverse data, but results in overfitting on GTAPolicy, 7 Preprint Table 3: Left: Policy Override results. We show that TriMPI consistently outperforms strong baselines in generalizing to updated policies, demonstrating favorable real-world usage where model behavior can be governed by both internalized policies and in-context instructions.

We further present a qualitative example in Figure 7, showing that TriMPI achieves better alignment with the policy in both intermediate thoughts and final answers. Ablation Analysis. In Table 2, we additionally provide a comprehensive ablation study on the key components proposed in TriMPI, including the RL stage, the VM-CPT stage, and the PolicyRollout algorithm. The findings are as follows: (1) The RL stage contributes most of the improvements compared with SFT baselines, highlighting the importance of learning from experience for complex, reasoning-intensive policies. We also observe a unique benefit of the RL stage in better leveraging non-CoT data, which is typically more abundant than CoT data, as shown in Table 9. (2) the VM-CPT stage brings further improvements to both the SFT and RL stages, with the effect being more pronounced in the RL stage due to more grounded exploration; and (3) PolicyRollout yields additional gains over the original GRPO and DAPO algorithms. 93.9% Reduction 85.7% Reduction Figure 6: Efficiency metrics before and after MPI.

We report efficiency metrics in Figure 6, including the number of prompt tokens and the prefill inference time (i.e., the first forward pass on the input prompt) before and after internalization. All metrics are computed on Qwen2.5-VL-7B. With the policy removed from the prompt, we observe reductions of up to 93.9% in prompt tokens and 85.7% in prefill inference time. Impact of Policy Complexity and Model Size. We further investigate the impact of policy complexity and model size on the effectiveness of different MPI algorithms. As shown in Table 7, we conduct additional experiments on (1) N = 4 policies in ClevrPolicy and (2) 3B models. Our findings are twofold: (1) TriMPI yields more pronounced gains over the baselines on complex policies, while the performance gap is smaller on simpler policies (e.g., N = 4). This highlights the importance of our method for handling increasingly complex policies in real-world settings. (2) TriMPI consistently outperforms the baselines on 3B models, demonstrating the generality of the method. 5.2 POLICY OVERRIDE: EVALUATING GENERALIZATION TO POLICY UPDATES In real-world scenarios, policies may be frequently updated or partially overridden by new rules. Ideally, the internalized model should generalize to these updated policies when they are provided in-context. To evaluate this capability, we introduce a new evaluation setting, Policy Override, where unseen policy content is specified in-context during inference with internalized models. As illustrated in Figure 10, for ClevrPolicy we retain the policy name but modify the conditions, while for GTAPolicy we alter the tool-calling rules, resulting in a different choice of tool version. Table 3 (left) shows that TriMPI consistently outperforms all baselines and ablated settings, demonstrating stronger generalization beyond merely fitting to a specific policy. 8 Preprint 5.3 POLICY REFERRAL: EVALUATING POLICY KNOWLEDGE INJECTION Beyond end-task performance, which measures how well the model generates policy-compliant responses, we further investigate how well the model embeds the policy knowledge itself. To this end, we consider a new evaluation setting, Policy Referral, where we leverage LLM-as-a-judge to examine the intermediate reasoning process of the model\u2019s responses. The goal is to assess whether the referral to the original policy is accurate and to assign a score between 0 and 1. Figure 8 illustrates this evaluation setting, and Table 3 (right) presents the results, reporting the average score over a subset of 100 test responses from each dataset. We find that TriMPI achieves more accurate policy referral, indicating that it not only learns end-task behavior but also internalizes the underlying policy. 5.4 EVALUATING ROBUSTNESS TO CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING Similar to related work in continual learning (Yu et al., 2024) and knowledge injection (Song et al., 2025), a major challenge in MPI is avoiding catastrophic forgetting, ensuring that policy-related performance improves while general non-policy abilities are preserved. To assess this, we adopt two widely used general reasoning benchmarks, MMMU-Pro (Yue et al., 2024) (multimodal) and MMLU- Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) (textual), to evaluate the model\u2019s robustness to catastrophic forgetting after internalization. The results are presented in Table 8. We observe that the baselines exhibit", "are preserved. To assess this, we adopt two widely used general reasoning benchmarks, MMMU-Pro (Yue et al., 2024) (multimodal) and MMLU- Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) (textual), to evaluate the model\u2019s robustness to catastrophic forgetting after internalization. The results are presented in Table 8. We observe that the baselines exhibit significant performance degradation after MPI on GTAPolicy, while maintaining strong performance after MPI on ClevrPolicy. This discrepancy arises because the small dataset size of GTAPolicy makes it more prone to overfitting. In contrast, TriMPI consistently preserves strong general reasoning abilities across all settings, achieving the best overall performance. 6 RELATED WORK 6.1 PROMPT COMPRESSION AND DELIBERATIVE ALIGNMENT A line of related research (Li et al., 2024) focuses on compressing long prompts into more compact forms that can still effectively guide large language models. Early efforts explored both hard prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2024), where discrete tokens are carefully pruned, and soft prompts (Zhao et al., 2023; Wingate et al., 2022; Mu et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023), where continuous embeddings are learned to replace verbose instructions or demonstrations. More recent work, such as PromptIntern (Zou et al., 2024), adopts a progressive fine-tuning approach that internalizes prompts into the model without introducing additional parameters. Another line of related work is on personalized multimodal models (Nguyen et al., 2024; 2025), for which we provide a detailed discussion in Appendix K. While promising, these methods focus on prompts limited to task templates and demonstrations that demand little reasoning. Moreover, the introduction of special embeddings confines the model to a specific task, reducing its ability to handle general queries. Deliberative Alignment (Guan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025) extends this idea to a more general alignment setting without sacrificing the model\u2019s overall capabilities. Its goal is to embed the knowledge of a safety specification into the model parameters while emphasizing reasoning over the internalized knowledge. Our proposed MPI task follows this high-level motivation but further extends the scope to multimodal models and considers diverse conversational agent tasks beyond safety. 6.2 IMPROVING GRPO FROM THE ROLLOUT PERSPECTIVE We also draw inspiration from recent multimodal reasoning work that investigates improving GRPO- related RLVR algorithms from the rollout perspective. Methods such as NoisyRollout (Liu et al., 2025) and R1-ShareVL (Yao et al., 2025) demonstrate the benefits of diversifying the rollout space with responses generated from altered instances using semantically consistent augmentations, such as applying moderate Gaussian noise to the visual inputs. Our proposed PolicyRollout algorithm follows the same high-level idea of augmenting the rollout space, but instead of introducing noise, it provides the policy in-context to enable more grounded exploration. PolicyRollout illustrates the potential of a more general approach to incorporating additional guidance in the RL stage, while remaining aligned with the original optimization task. 9 Preprint 7 CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS In this work, we propose a new task, Multimodal Policy Internalization, which aims to address the emerging challenge of maintaining in-context efficiency while following complex policies in multimodal conversational agents. We introduce two new benchmarks spanning analytical and", "aligned with the original optimization task. 9 Preprint 7 CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS In this work, we propose a new task, Multimodal Policy Internalization, which aims to address the emerging challenge of maintaining in-context efficiency while following complex policies in multimodal conversational agents. We introduce two new benchmarks spanning analytical and real- world settings, along with a highly effective training paradigm, TriMPI. The remaining limitations are: (1) scaling up the datasets with more diverse real-world images and tasks; (2) developing more sophisticated continual pretraining strategies beyond simply masking visual tokens; and (3) designing training strategies for internalizing mixtures of tasks with very different response formats. 8 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We include an anonymous source code archive in the supplementary material, containing training and evaluation instructions for reproducing the results in this paper.

Table 4 summarizes the training hyperpa- rameters for different stages. For the RL stages, we set the clipping ratio to \u03f5l = 0.2, \u03f5h = 0.3 for GRPO and \u03f5l = 0.2, \u03f5h = 0.28 for DAPO. The rollout batch size is 384 for ClevrPolicy and 256 for GTAPolicy. The reference KL coefficient is set to \u03b2 = 0.01 for GRPO. The maximum number of retries for dynamic sampling is set to 20 for DAPO. The actual number of RL steps taken in each run is reported in Table 5. We use 4 NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs for SFT stages and 8 H100 for CPT and RL stages. C DATASET CREATION DETAILS C.1 CLEVRPOLICY C.1.1 POLICY GENERATION IN CLEVRPOLICY As described in \u00a73.1, we first generate a set of binary decision trees to construct the policies. We define two types of nodes: decision nodes and response nodes. A decision node checks whether the current input image satisfies a sampled condition (for example, the existence of a cyan object), while a response node corresponds to a unique outcome. Each decision node (non-leaf node) samples an attribute type and an attribute value from the following ontology: \u2022 Shape: \u201ccube\u201d, \u201csphere\u201d, \u201ccylinder\u201d \u2022 Color: \u201cgray\u201d, \u201cred\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cbrown\u201d, \u201cpurple\u201d, \u201ccyan\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d \u2022 Size:\u201csmall\u201d, \u201clarge\u201d \u2020https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct \u2021https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct \u00a7https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/claude-on-amazon-bedrock 15 Preprint Table 5: Detailed statistics of the number of RL steps under different settings.

For example, if the parent node checks for cyan objects and the edge is true, the child node will not check the color attribute again, to avoid logical conflicts. This results in 4, 16, and 55 unique target responses for policies with N = 2, N = 4, and N = 6, respectively. Given a sampled decision tree, we then convert it into a textual instruction containing three main components: a general instruction, a unique policy name, and sections of conditions governing the response behavior. This policy challenges the model to perform multi-hop reasoning across different sections in order to faithfully follow the rules. We further introduce two variants of ClevrPolicy, namely, ClevrPolicy-T and ClevrPolicy-M, depend- ing on whether the policy itself contains image content. As shown in Figure 2 (left), in ClevrPolicy-M the attribute value in a decision node may be demonstrated by a small image crop instead of natural language. This introduces an additional level of difficulty for policy following. C.1.2 TRAINING DATA CREATION IN CLEVRPOLICY We generate a mixture of 10 unique policies for each of the three levels of complexity indicated by the layer number N \u22082, 4, 6. For each policy, we then sample 2K images as training data. The ground- truth answers can be automatically obtained by verifying the scene graph against the corresponding decision tree. This results in 20K non-CoT QA pairs for each training task in ClevrPolicy-T and ClevrPolicy-M. Similarly, we sample another 2K unseen instances for testing. Importantly, the underlying decision trees are not accessible to the model during subsequent MPI training. An input-output example is illustrated in Figure 2 (right). Evaluation is performed based on exact string matching, and results are reported in terms of accuracy. C.2 GTAPOLICY C.2.1 POLICY CREATION IN GTAPOLICY We manually construct a complex policy based on the GTA dataset (Wang et al., 2024a), which was originally proposed as a multimodal tool using benchmark. As illustrated in Figure 3 (left), the GTAPolicy policy consists of two main components: tool descriptions and tool calling rules. The tool descriptions contain the metadata for all 13 types of tools, including the tool name, description, and arguments. To ensure", "was originally proposed as a multimodal tool using benchmark. As illustrated in Figure 3 (left), the GTAPolicy policy consists of two main components: tool descriptions and tool calling rules. The tool descriptions contain the metadata for all 13 types of tools, including the tool name, description, and arguments. To ensure that model performance reflects its ability to follow the internalized policy rather than relying on prior knowledge, we further introduce a versioning mechanism and user-conditional tool-calling rules. Specifically, a tool such as \u201cOCR\u201d may have multiple versions, e.g., \u201cOCR v1\u201d and \u201cOCR v2.\u201d A total of 24 tool-calling rules specify which particular version to use depending on the profile attributes of the input user. This design simulates real-world business 16 Preprint rules in which certain user properties must be considered during decision-making and tool calling, such as whether the user is a premium member. C.2.2 TRAINING DATA CREATION IN GTAPOLICY We first reformulate the multi-turn data from the GTA dataset into a single-turn tool calling task to avoid overcomplicating the MPI setting with intermediate tool calling errors. As illustrated in Figure 3 (right), each input instance consists of five parts: visual inputs (potentially multiple images), a user profile, a user query, an interaction history containing previous tool calls and returned values, and a general instruction prompt. The expected output is a tool call formatted in JSON that specifies the tool name (with version) and the corresponding arguments. The final dataset contains 451 instances for training and 106 instances for testing. To evaluate the tool calls, we use exact match on the tool name, and apply different evaluation metrics to the argument values depending on their type (e.g., IoU for bounding boxes, text similarity for free form text queries). Detailed evaluation metrics are provided in Appendix C.3. C.3 EVALUATION METRICS AND RLVR REWARDS Evaluation Metrics for ClevrPolicy. We use accuracy based on the exact match between the predicted and ground truth outcomes, for example, \u201cCase 0\u201d. Accordingly, the following accuracy reward is used for GRPO and DAPO on ClevrPolicy: RAcc-ClevrPolicy = 1[Exact Match(y, \u02c6y)], (4) where y and \u02c6y denote the parsed response and the ground truth, respectively. Evaluation Metrics for GTAPolicy. For the tool name, we use accuracy based on exact match. For the arguments, we identify four categories of argument types and apply different metrics accordingly. The full list of tools and argument definitions is shown in Figure 16. We provide the argument names and their corresponding evaluation metrics as follows: \u2022 Exact match: \u201cposition\u201d, \u201ccolor\u201d, \u201cimage\u201d, \u201ck\u201d, \u201ctop1\u201d \u2022 Text similarity: \u201cattribute\u201d, \u201ctext\u201d, \u201cquery\u201d, \u201ccommand\u201d, \u201cannotation\u201d, \u201ckeywords\u201d, \u201cin- struction\u201d \u2022 Python Eval: \u201cexpression\u201d \u2022 IoU: \u201cbbox\u201d Exact match is used for arguments that require precise string matching, for example, the image name when running a tool. The text similarity metric evaluates arguments in free-form text format, such as search queries or object names. We use BertScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to compute the semantic similarity between two text sequences. For expressions involving numerical operations, we use the Python \u201ceval\u201d function to compute the final outcome and compare it with the", "evaluates arguments in free-form text format, such as search queries or object names. We use BertScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to compute the semantic similarity between two text sequences. For expressions involving numerical operations, we use the Python \u201ceval\u201d function to compute the final outcome and compare it with the ground truth. For bounding box arguments, we use Intersection over Union (IoU) to compute the overlap between the predicted and ground truth coordinates. All scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. The final argument score is computed as the average across all argument fields. We then compute an overall score for the entire tool call as the average of the tool accuracy and the argument score. Accordingly, the following accuracy reward is used for GRPO and DAPO on GTAPolicy: RAcc-GTAPolicy = 0.5 \u00d7 Tool Acc + 0.5 \u00d7 Argument Score (5) C.4 FULL POLICY EXAMPLES Examples of the full policy for ClevrPolicy-T, ClevrPolicy-M and GTAPolicy are presented in Figures 14, 15 and 16, respectively. 17 Preprint Table 6: Detailed dataset statistics.

Specifically, on ClevrPolicy, we use forward CoT with answer filtering to generate CoT data, where a generator model is asked to solve the task with intermediate reasoning steps given the policy and the input query. The generated instances are then filtered based on answer correctness. For GTAPolicy, due to the small dataset size, we adopt reverse CoT, where the generator model is provided with both the inputs and the ground truth answer and asked to generate the intermediate rationales. Reverse CoT is suitable in such settings where filtering is difficult or the data samples are scarce. We select the generator model based on the zero-shot in-context performance shown in Table 1. For ClevrPolicy-T, we use", "the inputs and the ground truth answer and asked to generate the intermediate rationales. Reverse CoT is suitable in such settings where filtering is difficult or the data samples are scarce. We select the generator model based on the zero-shot in-context performance shown in Table 1. For ClevrPolicy-T, we use the base model itself, Qwen-2.5VL-7B (Bai et al., 2025), as the generator. For more challenging settings, i.e., ClevrPolicy-M and GTAPolicy, we use Claude-4(Anthropic, 2025). In the case of ClevrPolicy-M with Claude-4, we subsample the input non-CoT data to 3K in order to match the CoT dataset size of ClevrPolicy-T. After filtering, we obtain approximately 2.5K CoT instances for each ClevrPolicy setting and 451 instances for GTAPolicy. The full statistics of the CoT and non-CoT data can be found in Table 6. Figures 11, 12 and 13 provide examples of the CoT data for all three datasets.

E ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON VARYING POLICY COMPLEXITY AND MODEL SIZE Table 7 illustrates the additional results on varying task complexity and model size. TriMPI is especially valuable for handling complex policies, showing larger gains over baselines in these settings while maintaining consistent improvements even on simpler cases (e.g., N = 4). Moreover, it generalizes well across model scales, consistently outperforming baselines on 3B models as well. F QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Figure 7 shows a qualitative example from the ClevrPolicy dataset, comparing the responses of different MPI algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed TriMPI algorithm successfully refers to the original policy and produces a policy-compliant answer, whereas the SFT and SFT+RL baselines suffer from incorrect policy referral or reasoning errors. 19 Preprint Table 8: Robustness to catastrophic forgetting.

For example, in ClevrPolicy, after filtering, we obtain 2.5K CoT examples versus 20K non-CoT examples. A unique benefit of the RL stage (with GRPO and DAPO) is that it does not require CoT annotations. To investigate the extent to which the RL stage can benefit from non-CoT data relative to CoT data, we conduct the following experiment. We run RL algorithms using only CoT data and additionally include an SFT baseline, where the model is first trained on CoT data and then further trained on non-CoT data. The results are shown in Table 9. We observe that the RL stage can more effectively leverage the abundant non-CoT data compared to SFT-only approaches.

I need to find the price of Hennessy from the menu to calculate the total cost The assistant has already identified that there are 2 bottles of Hennessy liquor in the first image. Now I need to extract the pricing information from the menu in the second image to determine how much to pay. To read the text from the price menu image, I need to use an OCR tool. Let me recall the OCR tool selection rules: For OCR Tools: - If user credits <= 250, use \"OCR_v5\" - If 250 < user credits <= 750, use \"OCR_v4\" if account_type in [A, B], otherwise use \"OCR_v3\" - If user credits > 750, use \"OCR_v2\" if age < 21, otherwise use \"OCR_v1\" - If the image contains mathematical expressions, use \"MathOCR\" instead Looking at the user profile: - Account type: B - Age: 28 - Credits: 250 Since the user credits = 250 (which satisfies credits <= 250), I should use \"OCR_v5\". The second image appears to be a pricing table/menu, not containing mathematical expressions, so I should use the regular OCR tool rather than MathOCR. Therefore, I need to call OCR_v5 on the menu image (image/image_204.jpg) to extract the pricing information, specifically to find the price of Hennessy so I can calculate the total cost for 2 bottles.</think> Answer: {\"name\": \"OCR_v5\", \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image/image_204.jpg\"}} Figure 13: CoT data example (GTAPolicy). 24 Preprint Full Policy Example - ClevrPolicy-T (N=6) The following policy provides a decision-making framework for processing a visual input.

To address this gap, we intro- duce StatEval, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, span- ning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop vali- dation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assess- ment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source mod- els such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57% on research-level problems, with open- source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We ex- pect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/. Keywords: Statistical reasoning; Automated extraction, Proof verification; Multi-agent evaluation 1 arXiv:2510.09517v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 1 Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), demonstrating remarkable progress in complex reasoning (Guo et al., 2025), fluent text generation, and even automated proof discovery (Yu et al., 2025). These advances have spurred growing adoption of LLMs across education, data science, and re- search, where they are increasingly used for tutoring, problem explanation, data analysis, and hypothesis formulation (Wu et al., 2021; Polu and Sutskever, 2020; Khan et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023). However, despite their broad deployment in quantitative domains, the field of statistics, which forms the foundation of modern data-driven science, has received little attention in LLM evaluation. Statistics differs fundamentally from other quantitative disciplines. Rather than focus- ing on symbolic manipulation or fixed-form computation, it emphasizes reasoning under uncertainty, connecting probability theory, inference, regression, Bayesian analysis, multi- variate methods, and asymptotic theory into a unified framework. Yet existing large-scale LLM evaluations rarely cover these competencies: statistical problems account for less than 3% of recent reasoning benchmarks (Paster et al., 2025), and when included, they are typ- ically treated as isolated probability puzzles without structured categorization or coverage of inferential reasoning (Gao et al., 2024). This gap makes it impossible to rigorously as- sess whether LLMs can function as capable statisticians or support data-driven scientific discovery. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce StatEval, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to evaluating large language models", "structured categorization or coverage of inferential reasoning (Gao et al., 2024). This gap makes it impossible to rigorously as- sess whether LLMs can function as capable statisticians or support data-driven scientific discovery. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce StatEval, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to evaluating large language models on statistical reasoning. With nearly 20,000 meticulously curated problems, StatEval covers the entire spectrum of statistics, from basic undergraduate exercises to advanced research-level challenges, captures the full 2 breadth and depth of the discipline, as illustrated in Figure 1. Its unprecedented scale and comprehensive coverage make it among the largest reasoning benchmarks to date. A concise yet systematic scoring framework is further established to ensure reliable assessment of model performance across diverse statistical tasks.

StatEval is first organized along a difficulty axis, which defines two datasets. (i) The foundational knowledge dataset contains 13817 problems drawn from over 50 textbooks and course materials spanning undergraduate to doctoral levels, including both multiple-choice and short question\u2013answer formats that assess LLMs\u2019 mastery of core statistical knowl- 3 edge. (ii) The Statistical research dataset consists of 2,374 verifiable, proof-based ques- tions sourced from 18 top-tier peer-reviewed journals, designed to assess LLMs\u2019 reasoning ability on research-oriented tasks requiring rigorous derivations and proof-style solutions. Within each dataset, we further introduce a disciplinary axis, organized as a two-level tax- onomy that covers more than 30 subdomains, including probability, inference, regression, Bayesian methods, multivariate statistics, asymptotic theory, experimental design, and ma- chine learning. This dual-axis design enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across both foundational and advanced areas of statistics. All problems are presented in text-only format, ensuring that the evaluation directly probes reasoning ability rather than reliance on computational tools. StatEval is built through a multi-agent LLM pipeline with human-in-the-loop verifica- tion, designed to balance scalability and rigor. The pipeline comprises four key agents: file conversion, context segmentation, problem generation, and quality control. Initially, a cor- pus of over 10,000 textbooks and research papers is converted into clean, LATEX-compatible text using multi-modal models such as MinerU (Wang et al., 2024). Subsequently, the con- text segmentation agent applies an LLM-driven regular-expression framework to identify structural elements Theorem, Lemma, and Example and extract them with their relevant con- text while filtering unrelated material to reduce noise. Thereafter, the problem-generation agent reformulates extracted theorems into self-contained question\u2013answer pairs under a rubric that enforces appropriate difficulty, single-answer focus, and quantitative verifiabil- ity. Finally, a GPT-5-based quality control agent verifies rubric adherence and contextual completeness before human experts review correctness and difficulty. Feedback from these reviews, especially representative failures, is periodically incorporated as few-shot exem- plars to refine segmentation and generation in later iterations. This pipeline automates the transformation of scholarly materials into standardized, verifiable evaluation data, pro- 4 viding a scalable and", "contextual completeness before human experts review correctness and difficulty. Feedback from these reviews, especially representative failures, is periodically incorporated as few-shot exem- plars to refine segmentation and generation in later iterations. This pipeline automates the transformation of scholarly materials into standardized, verifiable evaluation data, pro- 4 viding a scalable and continuously improving framework for benchmark construction in scientific domains. Preliminary results demonstrate that StatEval presents a significant challenge. LLMs show steadily improving performance on fundamental statistical knowledge, particularly in domains such as machine learning and applied regression, yet their abilities remain uneven. Accuracy drops substantially on more basic but essential areas such as probability theory and linear models, which may be due to an overrepresentation of popular subjects in the training corpora, leaving foundational topics underexposed. At the Statistical research dataset, model performance is even more limited. Accuracy is significantly lower than on widely used datasets such as AIME25, underscoring the distinctive nature of statistics problems that require formal proofs and theoretical derivations. Even the most advanced proprietary systems, such as GPT5-mini and Gem2.5-flash, achieve only 57.62% and 51.14% accuracy, respectively, while the best open-source model reaches just 51.10%. These find- ings highlight both the intrinsic difficulty of statistical reasoning and the importance of StatEval in exposing capability imbalances that remain hidden in narrower benchmarks. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We present StatEval, the first benchmark dedicated to statistics, providing compre- hensive coverage across sub-disciplines and difficulty levels. 2. We develop a scalable multi-agent plus human-in-the-loop pipeline that automates the extraction of problems from scientific corpora while preserving academic rigor. 3. We conduct systematic experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, uncovering significant gaps in their statistical reasoning and pointing to directions for future improvement. The structure of this paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the dataset and its distributional characteristics. Chapter 3 describes the data production pipeline. 5 Chapter 4 presents our scoring strategy. Chapter 5 reports the experimental results and analysis. The Appendix offers supplementary information, including figures, experimental results, prompts, and further discussions. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available; readers may access the full resources via our GitHub repository at https://github.com/ StatEval/StatEval. In addition, detailed results of model evaluations can be found on our web platform at https://StatEval.github.io/. 2 Breakdown of StatEval In this section, we provide a systematic description of StatEval, a benchmark that spans both fundamental and frontier aspects of statistics. StatEval is structured along the dif- ficulty axis into two parts: a foundational knowledge dataset and a statistical research dataset. For each dataset, we detail its data sources, the distribution of problems, and the integration of the disciplinary axis, which supports fine-grained evaluation across a wide spectrum of statistical subdomains. 2.1 Foundational knowledge dataset The foundational knowledge dataset evaluates large language models on their mastery of basic statistical knowledge and their ability to solve classic problems through founda- tional reasoning, spanning both undergraduate foundations and graduate-level training. To provide a comprehensive overview, we analyze the dataset from three complementary perspectives: source, question formats, and disciplinary structure. 6 Data Sources. The dataset consists of 13,817", "mastery of basic statistical knowledge and their ability to solve classic problems through founda- tional reasoning, spanning both undergraduate foundations and graduate-level training. To provide a comprehensive overview, we analyze the dataset from three complementary perspectives: source, question formats, and disciplinary structure. 6 Data Sources. The dataset consists of 13,817 problems, with 6,336 at the undergraduate and 7,481 at the graduate level. Problems are drawn from three primary sources: (i) 45 classical textbooks in statistics and related fields, which supply the majority of problems and ensure full curriculum coverage; (ii) over one thousand carefully verified, exam-style questions from graduate entrance examinations and curated exercise collections, introduced for the first time as an open benchmark; and (iii) recommended problems from publicly available courses at leading international universities, supplemented by online resources, enhancing topical diversity. Question Formats. Complementing the source analysis, we categorize problems by for- mat. The dataset includes 1,517 multiple-choice questions and 12,300 open-ended Question and Answer (QA) questions, Multiple-choice items, following conventions established by benchmarks such as MMLU and SciQA, primarily test factual recall and concept recogni- tion. Open-ended questions, in contrast, require explicit derivations, detailed reasoning, or formal proofs, offering a rigorous evaluation of both reasoning ability and structured problem-solving skills. Disciplinary Structure. To further organize the dataset content, problems are hierar- chically classified. At the primary tier, problems are grouped into three domains: Proba- bility, Statistics, and Machine Learning. At the second tier, each domain is divided into course-level subjects with distinct undergraduate and graduate coverage. For instance, undergraduate probability includes Elementary Probability, Stochastic Processes, and El- ementary Time Series, whereas graduate-level probability extends to Advanced Probabil- ity (including stochastic processes), Advanced Time Series and Information Theory. The detailed distribution of problems across levels, domains, and subfields is summarized in 7 Table 4, with Figure 2 providing a visualization of category proportions alongside rep- resentative source textbooks. This layered design ensures that StatEval captures both foundational training and advanced theoretical rigor, providing a principled framework for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs across educational stages and statistical subdomains.

Each task in the dataset is constructed to embody the core components of modern statistical reasoning, including precise assumptions, intermediate lemmas, and measure-theoretic or algorithmic arguments, all leading to rigorously justified conclusions. Data Sources. This dataset contains 2,374 proof-based research tasks derived from 2,719 research articles published between 2020 and 2025 across 18 leading journals (Table 3). The corpus covers top-tier statistics venues (e.g., Annals of Statistics, Biometrika, JASA) and closely related fields in econometrics, probability, and machine learning. 8 Question Formats. Problem formulation is standardized by extracting peer-reviewed theorems, propositions, and lemmas from the selected articles and recasting them as research-level proof tasks. Each task is centered around a single quantitative objective , a precisely defined target such as finding an exact constant, a closed-form expression, a distributional form, a convergence rate, or an explicit bound with constants. This ap- proach preserves the full complexity of original research problems while enabling objective, criteria-based solution verification. Integrating research-level difficulty with concrete end- points supports reliable LLM output evaluation, consistent with best practices established in leading benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, AIME). Further details on document collection, filtering, and quality control are provided in Section 3.

In terms of organization, the disciplinary axis of the research dataset extends the taxonomy introduced in the foundational knowledge dataset (Sec- tion 2.1). While the fundamental knowledge is organized around curricular subjects in statistics education, the research dataset expands these into research-level categories in order to capture the complexity of modern statistical inquiry and enable finer-grained eval- uation of reasoning ability. At the primary tier, the original three domains: Probability, Statistics, and Machine 9 Learning are refined into eight specialized subdomains: Classical Statistical Modeling and Inference, Causal Inference and Experimental Design, High-dimensional Data Modeling, Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes, Graphs and Structured Data, Bayesian and Generative", "eval- uation of reasoning ability. At the primary tier, the original three domains: Probability, Statistics, and Machine 9 Learning are refined into eight specialized subdomains: Classical Statistical Modeling and Inference, Causal Inference and Experimental Design, High-dimensional Data Modeling, Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes, Graphs and Structured Data, Bayesian and Generative Models, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, and Other Emerging Di- rections. To further enhance granularity, a new second-tier classification is introduced, based on theoretical property type. This framework distinguishes among categories of theoretical results, including Asymptotic Properties, Identifiability and Consistency, Distributional Properties, Generalization and Error Bounds, Optimality Results, Testing Validity, Con- vergence and Stability, Structural Guarantees, among others, as summarized in Table 5. This structure preserves continuity with the foundational dataset while introducing new axes that capture the breadth of frontier research, allowing StatEval to evaluate LLMs not only on fundamental subject knowledge but also on their ability to address advanced reasoning and derivation in cutting-edge statistical problems. Further details regarding the distribution across research areas and theoretical property categories are provided in Figure 3 and Appendix B . 3 Data Processing Pipeline The data processing pipeline serves two complementary purposes: (i) to support large- scale, reliable extraction of Statistical research datasets from heterogeneous sources, and (ii) to conduct systematic quality inspection for the Foundational Knowledge dataset. The pipeline integrates LLMs with human-in-loop verification to ensure both scalability and precision, and incorporates few-shot feedbacks from human reviews to iteratively enhance performance. It consists of four core agents, each responsible for a distinct stage of the 10 end-to-end workflow (Figure 4). 1. File-Conversion Agent: This agent converts raw documents of diverse formats, PDFs, scanned files, and LATEX sources into clean, structured text. We employ multi- modal large language models (MLLMs), such as MinerU, for optical character recog- nition (OCR) and text reconstruction, converting outputs into LATEXform. This stan- dardization preserves mathematical expressions and notations while enabling seamless downstream processing and semantic parsing. 2. Context-Segmentation Agent: This agent extracts theorems together with their relevant context to support the subsequent problem-generation stage. It operates through an LLM-driven regular-expression framework, where the model dynamically generates and applies customized regular expressions to identify structural elements such as Theorem, Lemma, and Example. To ensure that each extracted fragment is self-contained, the agent also retrieves preceding definitions, assumptions, and other semantically related sections. We employ Gemini-Flash-Lite with a 1M-token con- text window to efficiently process long documents, capturing extended contextual dependencies while maintaining high throughput. This approach yields accurate and contextually complete theorem segments that provide reliable inputs for the following Problem-Generation Agent. 3. Problem-Generation Agent: This agent transforms extracted theorems and their surrounding context into question\u2013answer (QA) pairs under a rubric-based generation framework. A concrete example of such generated QA pairs is provided in Appendix D for reference. As this stage requires precise mathematical reasoning rather than structural parsing, we employ the reasoning-optimized GPT-5 model to ensure the 11 faithful reconstruction of problems into self-contained and verifiable forms. Each question is generated according to the following rubric: (a) Appropriate difficulty: Questions should align with advanced coursework or research-level", "As this stage requires precise mathematical reasoning rather than structural parsing, we employ the reasoning-optimized GPT-5 model to ensure the 11 faithful reconstruction of problems into self-contained and verifiable forms. Each question is generated according to the following rubric: (a) Appropriate difficulty: Questions should align with advanced coursework or research-level challenges, neither trivial nor overly open-ended. (b) Self-containment: Each problem must include sufficient background to be solved independently from the source text. (c) No leakage: Questions must not reveal intermediate steps, proof structures, or final results. (d) Single-answer constraint: Each problem should have exactly one well-defined solution. (e) Quantitative verifiability: The answer must be a single quantitative ob- ject\u2014an explicit number, closed-form expression, distribution, rate, or bound with constants, enabling objective evaluation. This rubric ensures that all generated QA pairs preserve theoretical rigor while re- maining suitable for automated assessment. 4. Quality-Control Agent: Each QA pair undergoes validation by an independent LLM-based quality-control agent, implemented with GPT-5, which re-evaluates ad- herence to the rubric checklist and checks for internal consistency between questions and answers. This stage serves as an automated filter, ensuring that only theoretically sound and structurally complete problems are passed to human review. 5. Human Check & Feedback: Samples that pass all automatic checks proceed to human verification by domain experts, who confirm semantic correctness, dif- ficulty appropriateness, and dataset classification. Feedback from this manual re- 12 view\u2014particularly examples of agent failures or subtle misclassifications\u2014is periodi- cally collected and incorporated as few-shot exemplars to improve the segmentation and generation agents in subsequent iterations. This feedback loop enhances robust- ness and precision over time without interrupting large-scale automated processing. This pipeline enables fully automated conversion of scholarly materials into standard- ized evaluation data. By combining LLM-based reasoning, dynamic regular-expression segmentation, and human-in-the-loop verification, StatEval achieves both scalability and reliability.

Each agent corresponds to a major functional stage in the automated extraction and verification process. 4 Scoring Framework To ensure rigorous and interpretable evaluation, StatEval defines different scoring schemes for Multiple-Choice Questions and Open-Ended QA Questions respectively. 4.1 Scoring for Multiple-Choice Questions Multiple-choice questions are graded by exact answer matching. A model receives a score of 1 if its selected option matches the correct answer and 0 otherwise. No partial credit is 13 given, ensuring a clear and objective standard consistent with common academic testing practice. 4.2 Scoring for Open-Ended QA Questions Open-ended questions, including those from both the Foundational Knowledge dataset and the Statistical Research dataset, are evaluated through a process-based scoring pipeline designed to assess both final correctness and the quality of intermediate reasoning. The pipeline consists of four sequential components: 1. Reasoning Step Extraction: The model\u2019s response is parsed to identify key rea- soning steps, including assumptions, logical transitions, and intermediate derivations. This stage reconstructs the complete reasoning chain to capture how the final result is obtained. 2. Outcome", "quality of intermediate reasoning. The pipeline consists of four sequential components: 1. Reasoning Step Extraction: The model\u2019s response is parsed to identify key rea- soning steps, including assumptions, logical transitions, and intermediate derivations. This stage reconstructs the complete reasoning chain to capture how the final result is obtained. 2. Outcome Extraction: Each reasoning step is further analyzed to extract its quan- titative or symbolic outcome (e.g., computed values, derived expressions, or identified distributions). This ensures that both the logical structure and the resulting inter- mediate outcomes are available for later verification. 3. LLM Judging: A dedicated LLM evaluator compares the extracted reasoning steps and outcomes with the reference solution. It verifies correctness, checks whether each step is necessary and sufficient, and detects any logical inconsistency or missing justification. 4. Scoring: Based on the LLM Judge\u2019s evaluation, each step is assigned binary scores along three dimensions: (i) Reasoning Accuracy, (ii) Step Completeness, and (iii) 14 Final Answer Correctness. The aggregated score for one evaluation pass is computed as S(i) final = \u03b1S(i) r + \u03b2S(i) s + (1 \u2212\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2)S(i) a , where S(i) r , S(i) s , S(i) a \u2208{0, 1} and \u03b1 = 0.4, \u03b2 = 0.3. To get conservative results, scoring is repeated three times with different random seeds, and the final score is defined as Sfinal = min{S(1) final, S(2) final, S(3) final}. This four-step design separates reasoning reconstruction from correctness judgment, en- abling fine-grained and interpretable evaluation. The framework outputs two complemen- tary indicators: (1) a final score reflecting overall correctness, and (2) a process score reflecting reasoning quality and stepwise consistency. An illustration of this pipeline is shown in Figure 5. Model output Question Take any three numbers \ud835\udc4b1, \ud835\udc4b2, \ud835\udc4b3, between (\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f), find the probability of \ud835\udc4b1 > \ud835\udc4b2 > \ud835\udc4b3. Answer \u03a4 1 6 Let \ud835\udc4b1, \ud835\udc4b2, \ud835\udc4b3 be three independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f,We want to find the probability that \ud835\udc4b1 > \ud835\udc4b2 > \ud835\udc4b3. Since the variables are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d.) from a continuous uniform distribution, all 3! = 8 possible orderings of \ud835\udc4b1, \ud835\udc4b2, \ud835\udc4b3 are equally likely due to symmetry. The ordering \ud835\udc4b1 > \ud835\udc4b2 > \ud835\udc4b3 is one such ordering. Therefore, the probability is : P \ud835\udc4b1 > \ud835\udc4b2 > \ud835\udc4b3 = \u03a4 1 8. 1.

To accommodate computational and API cost constraints, we construct a compact evalua- 15 tion subset, termed StatEval-mini, by sampling from both the Foundational Knowledge and Statistical Research datasets. From the foundational dataset, which contains 13,817 problems, we select 1,300 rep- resentative questions stratified by subject, difficulty, question type, and problem length, ensuring comprehensive coverage across undergraduate and graduate levels. Similarly, from the statistical research dataset, we select 2,000 questions following the same stratification principles. In this manner, StatEval-mini serves as a representative, balanced, and com- putationally efficient subset of the full StatEval benchmark, enabling cost-effective yet reliable evaluation. Evaluation Protocol All evaluations follow the scoring framework introduced in Sec- tion 4. For each model, the final leaderboard score is computed as the total points obtained divided by the total possible points across all questions. Each question carries a maximum score of 1.0, but partial credit (e.g., 0.5 or 0.8) may be awarded for open-ended problems according to the process-based scoring pipeline. We adopt OpenAI\u2019s latest model, GPT-5, as the judging model responsible for auto- matic scoring under this protocol. The evaluated models include a diverse set of open-source and closed-source systems covering a wide range of parameter scales and architectures. The open-source series comprises LLaMA-3.1, GPT-OSS (20B and 120B), DeepSeek-V3.1, and Qwen models (30B and 235B). The closed-source series includes GPT-5 variants and Gemini-2.5 models. Together, these models provide a comprehensive landscape for eval- uating statistical reasoning capabilities. 16 5.1 Evaluation Results Results for the foundational knowledge dataset. Table 1 summarizes the perfor- mance of various large language models at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Over- all, closed-source models consistently outperform open-source models across all subject areas and in overall mean scores, with GPT-5 achieving the highest overall mean of 82.85, demonstrating the strongest comprehensive capability to date.

Other open-source models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-V3.1, exhibit lower performance across both undergraduate and graduate tasks, highlighting that model scale and training opti- mization remain important factors affecting performance on foundational statistical tasks. Results for the statistical research dataset. Table 2 presents model performance across subfields and result categories, reflecting their reasoning capabilities in frontier sta- tistical tasks. A clear distinction emerges between closed-source and open-source mod- els, with closed-source systems, particularly the GPT-5 family, consistently outperforming open-source alternatives. The GPT5-mini series and its effort-tuned variants achieve the highest overall scores, exceeding 60% on average, while Gemini models demonstrate mod- erate but balanced performance across statistical subfields. Open-source Qwen models, though trailing in overall averages, show competitive potential in specific areas, especially in probability. Field-level results indicate the strongest reasoning performance in Probability and Statis- tics, where top models surpass 70%, whereas Machine Learning tasks remain more challeng- ing, with even the best GPT models scoring lower. Analysis by result category reveals that GPT-5 models excel in Identifiability & Consistency and Testing Validity, highlighting their strength in rigorous statistical reasoning and hypothesis evaluation. Gemini mod- els show relative advantages in Distributional Properties and Structural Guarantees, while Qwen models improve gradually in Probability and Distributional Properties as model scale increases. Overall, these results illustrate a hierarchy of reasoning ability in frontier statistical tasks: GPT5-mini and its tuned variants define the strongest benchmarks, Gemini models 18 occupy an intermediate position, and Qwen models represent a developing open-source alternative with emerging strengths. This emphasizes that both model scale and targeted optimization are crucial for advancing statistical reasoning capabilities in research-level contexts.

Performance by Subject Area . Across both foundational and research-level tasks, model performance exhibits consistent patterns among the three core statistical subjects: Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning. For undergraduate foundational tasks, top- performing closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5 mini-H) achieve 72.9% in Probability, 63.1% in Statistics, and 51.4% in Machine Learning. At the graduate level, these models show slight improvements in Probability (73\u201374%) and Statistics (64\u201365%), while performance in Machine Learning remains lower (52\u201358%). In research-level tasks, the pattern persists: closed-source models maintain relatively strong and balanced performance in Probability (66\u201373%) and Statistics (59\u201365%), whereas 19 Machine Learning remains the most challenging domain, with lower scores particularly for open-source models (e.g., Qwen3-30B achieves 44.9% in Statistics but only 41.2% in Machine Learning). Across both datasets, closed-source models consistently outperform open-source models by 8\u201315 percentage points. These results indicate that while foundational and frontier statistical reasoning is cap- tured robustly, Machine Learning tasks, especially at research level, pose greater difficulty for current LLMs. Figure 6 visualizes these trends, highlighting the relative robustness of Probability and Statistics compared to the decline observed in Machine Learning perfor- mance.

Research Capability by Result Category. In research-level tasks derived from the statistical research dataset, model performance exhibits notable variation across reason- ing categories. GPT-5 series models, including their high- and medium-effort variants, demonstrate outstanding performance in Identifiability & Consistency (74\u201377%) and Test- ing Validity (64\u201372%), reflecting strong capabilities in rigorous statistical reasoning and 20 theoretical verification. The Gemini series achieves comparatively higher scores in Distributional Properties (up to 59%) and Structural Guarantees (up to 60%), though performance in more complex reasoning categories, such as Optimality Results and Generalization & Error Bounds, is moderately lower (42\u201350%). Open-source models, including Qwen3-235B and Qwen3-30B, show solid performance in probability-related reasoning (50\u201362%) but lag in optimization- and generation-related reasoning (39\u201348% and 16\u201321%, respectively), highlighting the po- tential for targeted fine-tuning to enhance theoretical derivation skills. Figure 7 illustrates these contrasts, emphasizing the advantage of closed-source and effort-tuned models in research-level statistical reasoning across diverse categories.

Closed-source models, open-source models are shown for comparison. 21 6 Related work With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), systematic reasoning has become a key strength for solving complex problems in mathematics and science. Early progress was driven by prompting techniques such as \u201cchain of thought\u201d (Wei et al., 2022) and \u201ctree of thought\u201d (Yao et al., 2023), which encouraged stepwise reasoning. More recently, direct training approaches, including reward", "systematic reasoning has become a key strength for solving complex problems in mathematics and science. Early progress was driven by prompting techniques such as \u201cchain of thought\u201d (Wei et al., 2022) and \u201ctree of thought\u201d (Yao et al., 2023), which encouraged stepwise reasoning. More recently, direct training approaches, including reward modeling (Uesato et al., 2022) and frameworks like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) (Guo et al., 2025; Dai et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), have further improved multi-step reasoning, resulting in notable gains in mathematical reasoning (Guo et al., 2025), code generation (Wang et al., 2025), multimodal reasoning (Liu et al., 2025), and information extraction (Dai et al., 2025). A variety of benchmarks have been developed to measure these advances. However, LLMs\u2019 abilities in rigorous statistical problem solving remain underexplored, primarily due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks capturing the complexity of statistical inference and theoretical reasoning. To contextualize current progress in mathematical and applied statistical evaluation benchmarks, we categorize existing datasets as follows: 1. Mathematical reasoning benchmarks primarily assess logical and quantitative skills, but rarely emphasize statistics. The multidisciplinary MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020) includes only high-school level statistics, focusing on basic concepts. MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) contains a limited set of probability and count- ing problems, mainly from competition-style exercises. MathBench (Liu et al., 2024) incorporates some undergraduate-level statistics, yet topics remain relatively simple. Competition-focused datasets such as Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024) and OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024) emphasize probability problems, while UG- 22 MathBench (Xu et al., 2025) draws on university grading exercises but lacks highly challenging or comprehensive statistical tasks. Classical benchmarks like GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATHVERSE (Zhang et al., 2024) largely exclude statistics. 2. Research-level benchmarks aim to capture reasoning in cutting-edge academic work. TheoremQA (Chen et al., 2023) collects university-level theorem application problems across mathematics, physics, finance, and computer science to evaluate systematic theorem application. RealMath (Zhang et al., 2025) converts theorem proofs from arXiv papers into structured QA pairs for evaluation, though it mostly omits statistics. In the statistics domain, PaperBench (Starace et al., 2025) as- sembles evaluation questions from ICML papers in collaboration with authors, but its workflow is highly manual and coverage of theoretical statistics is limited. Other research-oriented benchmarks, such as SciAssess (Cai et al., 2024) and SciFIBench (Roberts et al., 2024), emphasize multimodal understanding (e.g., figures, document hierarchies) rather than formal theorem proving. 3. Data analysis benchmarks focus primarily on practical tasks such as coding, workflow execution, and quantitative reasoning, rather than theoretical inference. StatQA (Zhu et al., 2024) evaluates column identification, method selection, and hypothesis testing; QR-Data (Liu et al., 2024) examines quantitative reasoning on tabular datasets. Other benchmarks, including MLAgentBench (Huang et al., 2023), DSBench (Jing et al., 2024), DSCodeBench (Ouyang et al., 2025), and StatLLM (Song et al., 2025), assess programming and application of statistical soft- ware, but do not target systematic reasoning or formal proof ability. Despite the availability of these benchmarks, theoretical statistical inference remains largely unaddressed, and existing datasets focus on either applications or basic exercises. 23", "et al., 2025), and StatLLM (Song et al., 2025), assess programming and application of statistical soft- ware, but do not target systematic reasoning or formal proof ability. Despite the availability of these benchmarks, theoretical statistical inference remains largely unaddressed, and existing datasets focus on either applications or basic exercises. 23 StatEval fills this gap as the first comprehensive benchmark for formal statistical reason- ing, spanning both foundational and research-level problems across the discipline. Automated Evaluation Paradigms. To reduce manual evaluation costs, the \u201dLLM- as-a-judge\u201d paradigm (Ashktorab et al., 2025) is widely adopted, but its common binary (correct/incorrect) scoring is unsuitable for complex statistical tasks, reducing evaluation accuracy and stability (Shi et al., 2024). Strategies such as pairwise comparisons im- prove accuracy, but increase computational overhead (Jiang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2025); Product-of-Experts (PoE) reduces pairwise comparisons but still lacks fine-grained evalu- ation and relies on LLMs\u2019 black-box judgment (Liusie et al., 2024). Meanwhile, formal proof assistants like Lean 4(Moura and Ullrich, 2021), which enable rigorous verifica- tion in mathematics (e.g., FormalMath (Yu et al., 2025), PutnamBench (Tsoukalas et al., 2024)), face fundamental challenges in statistics, as statistical proofs involve random vari- ables, asymptotic arguments, and multiple solution paths that are difficult to formalize. In summary, despite progress in reasoning benchmarks and evaluation paradigms for LLMs, rigorous assessment of advanced statistical theory remains largely unaddressed. To fill this gap, we introduce StatEval, a benchmark and evaluation framework that system- atically measures both complex problem-solving and proof-based reasoning in statistics, enabling robust and fine-grained analysis of LLM capabilities. 7 Conclusion While LLM evaluations have largely focused on logic and mathematics, statistical reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce StatEval, the first comprehensive benchmark covering both foundational (13,000+ undergraduate-level) and research-level (2,000+ literature-based) statistical problems across varying difficulty and interdisciplinary 24 applications. Our systematic evaluation reveals that even the strongest closed-source mod- els struggle with research-level tasks, particularly in advanced machine learning theory. These results underscore the need and potential for enhancing LLMs\u2019 statistical reasoning, providing a benchmark and reference for future development of research-oriented statistical AI tools.

The dataset comprises 2,374 proof-based research tasks derived from 2,719 research articles published between 2020 and 2025 across 18 leading journals. This dataset emphasizes high-quality theoretical contributions, including both core statistical theory and interdisciplinary developments in probability, econometrics, and machine learning. For a complete list of the journals included, please refer to Table 3. Table 3: Research Data Sources by Discipline Discipline Journal Name Statistics Annals of Statistics, Biometrika, Journal of the American Statistical Association Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, Bernoulli, Biometrics Statistica Sinica, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics Econometrics Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, Econometrica Machine Learning Journal of Machine Learning Research, Machine Learning IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Probability Theory The Annals of Probability, Probability Theory and Related", "and Graphical Statistics Econometrics Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, Econometrica Machine Learning Journal of Machine Learning Research, Machine Learning IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Probability Theory The Annals of Probability, Probability Theory and Related Fields Our selection includes top-tier peer-reviewed journals in statistics, such as Annals of Statistics, Biometrika, Journal of the American Statistical Association, and Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, alongside journals from related fields, including econo- metrics, probability theory, and theoretical machine learning. This combination ensures that the benchmark captures a diverse set of formal theorem-proof reasoning tasks spanning multiple research domains. To facilitate data acquisition and maintain copyright compliance, corresponding arXiv versions were retrieved for all articles where available. This approach ensures open access 32 to the content and allows conversion of theoretical results into structured tasks without relying on supplementary arXiv-only papers. The journal selection was guided by several considerations. First, inclusion of top-tier, peer-reviewed journals guarantees that foundational and methodological contributions are well represented. Second, journals from adjacent fields capture the interdisciplinary nature of modern statistics, reflecting the integration of probability, econometrics, and machine learning theory. Third, application-focused journals, such as Annals of Applied Statis- tics, were deliberately excluded, as the benchmark emphasizes formal theoretical reasoning rather than applied case studies. After processing, the final dataset includes 2,374 ex- tractable theorem-proof problems suitable for benchmarking. B Research Category Frontier statistical literature can be classified from two perspectives: first, by research topics or subject areas, covering directions from classical statistical modeling to deep learning and causal inference; second, by the type of theoretical results, which systematically summarize the properties and performance of statistical methods. We provide a detailed description of these two perspectives below. B.1 Subject Area Classification Classical Statistical Modeling and Inference. This area primarily focuses on tradi- tional statistical methods and their theoretical properties, including linear and generalized linear models, quantile regression, kernel density estimation, smoothing and spline methods, Fr\u00b4echet regression, distribution embeddings, and shape/geometric statistics. It also covers heteroscedasticity and robust estimation, nonparametric change-point detection, multiple 33 testing and false discovery rate control, selective and sequential testing, bootstrap and resampling methods, high-dimensional optimization, and approximate algorithms. These methods form the foundational tools of statistical science, and understanding them is es- sential for both methodological development and applied analysis. High-dimensional Data Modeling. This area studies statistical modeling under high-dimensional or complex data structures, including high-dimensional regression (Lasso, Ridge, sparse regression), covariance and precision matrix estimation, high-dimensional principal component analysis, independence and correlation testing, tensor regression, multi-response/multivariate analysis, functional data analysis and functional time series, as well as semi-parametric survival models and individualized risk estimation. The high- dimensional setting arises in many modern applications, and methods in this category are critical to ensure reliable inference when the number of variables is large relative to the sample size. Bayesian and Generative Models. This area includes Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Gibbs sampling, HMC), variational inference, Bayesian nonparametrics (Dirich- let Process, Gaussian Process), hierarchical models and Bayesian factor analysis, approxi-", "category are critical to ensure reliable inference when the number of variables is large relative to the sample size. Bayesian and Generative Models. This area includes Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Gibbs sampling, HMC), variational inference, Bayesian nonparametrics (Dirich- let Process, Gaussian Process), hierarchical models and Bayesian factor analysis, approxi- mate Bayesian computation, Wasserstein distance and optimal transport, as well as deep generative models and score-based flow models. Bayesian methods provide a coherent prob- abilistic framework for incorporating prior information and handling uncertainty, making this category indispensable for both theory and practice. Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. Focuses on random structures and their analysis, including random graphs and networks, stochastic walks and mixing, extreme value theory, stochastic PDEs, random matrices and combinatorial probability, geometric probability, high-dimensional and classical time series, change-point detection, covariance and autocorrelation estimation, and Markov and hidden Markov models. Probability theory 34 forms the mathematical backbone of statistics, and a deep understanding of stochastic processes is critical for deriving rigorous inference results and modeling complex random phenomena. Graphs and Structured Data. Covers graph/network learning, community detec- tion, higher-order graph structures, graphical models, tensor decomposition and multiway representation, graph regression and high-dimensional graph modeling, network sampling and inference, as well as keyword and citation network analysis. Structured data arise ubiquitously in applications such as social networks, biological networks, and bibliomet- rics, making this area essential for modern statistical analysis. Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Includes policy gradient and actor- critic methods, distributed reinforcement learning, RLHF and bilevel RL, kernel-based RL, risk optimization, sample complexity analysis, LLM/statistical analysis, deep neu- ral network regression, causal estimation, transfer learning and robustness, and neural network-based splines. These methods are at the forefront of data-driven modeling, bridg- ing statistics and AI, and they provide powerful tools for prediction, optimization, and causal reasoning in complex environments. Causal Inference and Experimental Design. Covers individualized treatment rules, propensity score matching, robust estimation, latent/mediation causal effects, ex- perimental and observational design, offline RL causal policy estimation, functional/con- tinuous treatment effects, hierarchical effects, quantile treatment effects, negative controls, and causal structure learning. Causal inference is central for understanding mechanisms and making reliable decisions, making this category indispensable for both applied and methodological research. Other Emerging Directions. Includes stochastic/geometric object statistics, model validation and structural deviation analysis, power-law and tail analysis, robust inference, 35 shape/evolutionary statistics, predictive risk quantification, and physics-informed machine learning and simulation methods. These emerging areas capture new challenges in modern data science and provide avenues for innovative methods that cannot be addressed by classical approaches alone. B.2 Theoretical Property Classification From the perspective of theoretical property, frontier statistical literature often focuses on performance guarantees, feasibility, and uncertainty quantification. The main subcategories include: Optimality Results. Studies the optimal properties of methods or estimators, such as minimax optimality, Bayesian optimality, efficiency/UMVUE, and rate optimality. Un- derstanding optimality is crucial to benchmark methods and guide the development of statistically efficient procedures. This category also encompasses computational feasibil- ity, including algorithmic complexity, polynomial-time solvability, hardness/lower bounds, and statistical-computational trade-offs. Considering computational aspects ensures that theoretically optimal methods are practically implementable on", "optimality, efficiency/UMVUE, and rate optimality. Un- derstanding optimality is crucial to benchmark methods and guide the development of statistically efficient procedures. This category also encompasses computational feasibil- ity, including algorithmic complexity, polynomial-time solvability, hardness/lower bounds, and statistical-computational trade-offs. Considering computational aspects ensures that theoretically optimal methods are practically implementable on large-scale data. Asymptotic Properties. Covers asymptotic distribution, asymptotic efficiency, higher- order asymptotic expansions, high-dimensional asymptotics, and related properties. These results provide insights into the long-sample behavior of estimators and test statistics, help- ing to justify approximations, design confidence intervals, and inform inference procedures in complex or high-dimensional settings. Testing Validity. Focuses on controlling type I error, power properties, asymptotic null distributions, and sequential/adaptive testing. Valid hypothesis testing ensures sci- entific conclusions are statistically justified, making this category essential for evaluating claims in experimental and observational studies. Results here guide the construction of 36 tests that are both reliable and robust under various modeling assumptions. Convergence and Stability. Concerns algorithmic convergence, stochastic process convergence, stability analysis, and non-asymptotic convergence results. Stability and con- vergence analysis guarantees that iterative procedures, learning algorithms, and stochastic optimization methods are well-behaved, reproducible, and numerically robust, which is crucial for both theory and practical applications. Generalization and Error Bounds. Includes learning bounds, regularization bounds, model selection risk, non-asymptotic error bounds, and information-theoretic guarantees such as minimax lower bounds, sample complexity limits, and recoverability thresholds. These results are fundamental to understanding how well methods perform on unseen data, under model misspecification, or when data is limited, thereby providing guidance for model selection, algorithm design, and assessment of statistical reliability. Identifiability and Consistency. Studies parameter identifiability, causal identifia- bility, and consistency of estimators. Without identifiability, estimates may be non-unique or meaningless, and without consistency, estimates may not converge to the true parameters as sample size increases. This category ensures that inference procedures are theoretically sound and interpretable. Distributional Properties. Covers central limit theorems, extreme value/tail proper- ties, concentration inequalities, random matrix theory, dependence structures, and risk/uncer- tainty quantification including confidence intervals, posterior variability, and robust risk bounds. These properties provide a rigorous understanding of variability and dependence, underpin uncertainty assessment, and inform decisions in settings where data may be noisy, dependent, or high-dimensional. Structural Guarantees. Focuses on recoverability of graphical models, manifold/- geometric guarantees, causal/SEM identifiability, sparsity/low-rank recovery, and related 37 structural properties. Structural guarantees ensure that statistical models can capture es- sential patterns in the data, that recovery is feasible under realistic assumptions, and that the resulting models are interpretable and reproducible in practice. 38 C Prompt Prompt for Foundational knowledge dataset You are a helpful assistant designed to help with statistical problems.

Your core task is to judge whether a predicted answer aligns with the gold standard answer for theoretical questions in statistical proofs, following these strict and precise criteria: 1. Criteria for Non-Constant Components Non-constant components refer to expressions dependent on dimensions, sample sizes, or variables (e.g., O(\u221an), \u2225b\u03c01 \u2212\u03c0\u2217 1\u22252). For such components: - The order of the dominant term (the term determining the overall order/magni- tude) must be exactly consistent with the gold standard to count as correct. - If the result contains multiple terms, correctness is determined solely by the dom- inant term: only when the dominant term\u2019s order is strictly identical, the answer is correct (non-dominant terms with lower order/magnitude may be included or omitted without penalty). - Minor differences in non-essential constant coefficients (that do not alter the core order of the dominant term) do not affect correctness; however, any discrepancy in the dominant term\u2019s order renders the answer incorrect. 2. Criteria for Constant Components Constant components refer to fixed numerical values, constant terms in final results, or fixed coefficients definitive to the conclusion (e.g., 1\u2212\u03b1, constant 2 in 2\u03c3). For such components: - The predicted answer must be exactly identical to the gold standard. 3. Criteria for Formatting Differences Purely formatting differences (e.g., spacing, parentheses placement, LaTeX notation variations) that do not alter the mathematical value or the order of the dominant term in non-constant components will not be penalized\u2014count these as correct.

Veronica Rammouz1, Aaron Gonzalez1, Carlos Cruzportillo1, Adrian Tan1, Nicole Beebe2, Anthony Rios1 1The University of Texas at San Antonio 2Illinois Institute of Technology {veronica.rammouz, anthony.rios}@utsa.edu Abstract Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures based on dataset similar- ity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when these estimates produce reliable perfor- mance rankings across domains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reli- ability using a two-step evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets, spanning 15 domains, show that large language model\u2013based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings: ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are larger, and when the error model\u2019s predictions align with the base model\u2019s true failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross- domain model evaluation. 1 Introduction Evaluating NLP models across every possible do- main and setting is expensive, yet performance can vary widely with changes in topic, geography, or language use. For instance, a sentiment classifier that performs well on urban reviews may degrade sharply on rural dialects; a toxicity detector trained on social media English may underperform on re- gional variants. Because collecting labeled data in each new domain is costly, practitioners often rely on proxy signals, such as dataset similarity or linguistic drift, to estimate whether a model will generalize(Chang et al., 2023; Ramesh Kashyap et al., 2021; Pudasaini et al., 2025; Elsahar and Gall\u00e9, 2019; Sun et al., 2025; Ramesh Kashyap et al., 2021). However, while these estimates may correlate with accuracy in aggregate, it remains \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors Model GPT LLaMa Figure 1: Geographic illustration of our estimated per- formance over different states in the United States of America. unclear whether they can reliably indicate which models or datasets will perform better than others in practice. Prior work has explored diverse strategies for predicting model performance without direct eval- uation. Chang et al. (2023) examined how vocab- ulary and structural drift affect robustness; Xia et al. (2020) proposed similarity metrics based on n-gram overlap; and transfer learning studies have analyzed how pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT adapt to new domains through fine-tuning (Patankar et al., 2022). More recent work extends these ideas to multilingual and low- resource settings (Khiu et al., 2024), and to cor- rectness estimation itself, where Xiao et al. (2025) showed that even large models lack reliable self- knowledge of their own correctness, motivating cross-model approaches that learn from historical prediction patterns. Together, these efforts have advanced our understanding of model generaliza- tion, yet they largely focus on predicting absolute accuracy scores. In real deployments, however, the more actionable question is often ordinal: can we rank which datasets or domains are likely to", "motivating cross-model approaches that learn from historical prediction patterns. Together, these efforts have advanced our understanding of model generaliza- tion, yet they largely focus on predicting absolute accuracy scores. In real deployments, however, the more actionable question is often ordinal: can we rank which datasets or domains are likely to yield arXiv:2510.09519v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 stronger or weaker performance, before collecting new labels? It is important to rank reliably for model selection and development purposes. In this paper, we investigate performance pre- diction from a different perspective. Rather than introducing a new predictive model, we ask a more fundamental question: Can current approaches rank model performance correctly across diverse datasets and architectures? We conduct a system- atic analysis of this problem using a simple two- step framework: a base classifier (RoBERTa (Liu, 2019), a linear model, or large language models such as GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2023) and LLaMa- 3.1-8B) (Touvron et al., 2023a) trained on the source task, and an auxiliary error model that es- timates instance-level failures from the different base classifiers. This setup serves as a controlled environment for testing ranking reliability under varying conditions of domain shift, dataset size, and model type. By decoupling the method from the analysis, we can isolate where the predictions succeed and where they fail, providing insights into the advantages and limitations of each model. This approach is illustrated in Figure 1: if an LLM clas- sifier were to be applied to different cities within the United States, we would like a method that can accurately rank the performance of the for each city, with the ultimate goal of predicting where the classifier would yield poor results. Our results reveal that existing predictors and drift-based heuristics are often unstable when rank- ing datasets, even when they correlate well with accuracy. Performance rankings fluctuate across architectures and domains, indicating that current estimation techniques are less robust than previ- ously assumed. We identify key factors, such as calibration quality, representational alignment, and domain heterogeneity, that systematically drive these failures. These findings suggest that there remains a gap in knowledge for reliable ranking based on simplified grounded evaluation protocols. The present study addresses this gap in knowledge through the following: \u2022 We present the first large-scale study analyz- ing when and why model performance predic- tors succeed or fail at ranking datasets across domains. \u2022 We introduce a controlled two-step framework that enables consistent comparison of ranking reliability across model families and datasets. \u2022 We provide empirical evidence that commonly used error-prediction and drift-based methods are fragile under real distributional variation, offering new insights for improving model se- lection, fairness assessment, and deployment- time evaluation. 2 Related Work Instance-Level Complexity. Existing work ex- amines the complexity of classification tasks through the lens of dataset complexity, or instance- level complexity measures, to understand the hard- ness of a given prediction task (Cook et al., 2025; Lorena et al., 2024). Prior work leverages a plethora of dataset-level complexity metrics (e.g., feature importance or class overlap) or model- based evaluations, (e.g., cross-validation or training loss) to allow for the prioritization", "level complexity measures, to understand the hard- ness of a given prediction task (Cook et al., 2025; Lorena et al., 2024). Prior work leverages a plethora of dataset-level complexity metrics (e.g., feature importance or class overlap) or model- based evaluations, (e.g., cross-validation or training loss) to allow for the prioritization of classification tasks and benchmarking. However, existing meth- ods fail to address a fine-grained evaluation of in- stance hardness, specifically at the point of an NLP model\u2019s failure in a prediction task over out-of- domain datasets. We examine instance complexity through a novel two-step framework tailored to in- stance failures in such contexts. We employ our approach at scale to demonstrate its ranking capa- bility across different model variants and out-of- domain datasets (Eberlein et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2023; Kwon et al., 2024; Mallick et al., 2022). Dataset Drift. Much of the existing work in this area focuses on quantifying dataset drift, or covariate drift, through various metrics, such as token frequency divergences, TF-IDF vectors, and embedding-based distances (Ramesh Kashyap et al., 2021; Dredze et al., 2010; Elsahar and Gall\u00e9, 2019; Ruder et al., 2017). These meth- ods have been used to predict performance degra- dations when moving from in-domain to out-of- domain data (Feldhans et al., 2021). For instance, Ramesh Kashyap et al. (2021) highlight the effec- tiveness of Jensen-Shannon divergence (Lin, 2002) in assessing dataset shift, particularly in domain adaptation scenarios. Traditional approaches to dataset drift have typi- cally focused on holistic measures that treat the problem as a single monolithic concept, where the performance degradation is predicted based on overall divergence metrics. While useful, this ap- proach has limitations, as it does not account for the fact that different dimensions of linguistic variation, such as changes in vocabulary, syntax, or seman- tics, can affect model performance in distinct ways. For example, a model\u2019s performance might degrade drastically with a change in vocabulary while being less sensitive to syntactic variations (Chang et al., 2023). Prior work has shown that NLP models can exhibit high sensitivity to even small shifts in word distributions across domains, such as in the case of domain-specific jargon or regionally varied dialects (Yamshchikov et al., 2021; Ramesh Kashyap et al., 2021). Recent studies have started decomposing dataset drift into specific linguistic components, aiming to capture finer-grained distinctions. Chang et al. (2023) introduce the idea of breaking down drift into vocabulary, structural, and semantic dimen- sions. This decomposition offers a more inter- pretable view of how different types of changes in the data affect model predictions. For instance, vocabulary drift focuses on divergences in con- tent word usage, structural drift captures syntactic differences, and semantic drift identifies shifts in meaning that may not be detectable by simply look- ing at word distributions. This framework allows for more precise predictions of how models will generalize to new data, especially in low-resource or highly variable domains. We leverage drift met- rics as a baseline and demonstrate that they are inconsistent for ranking out-of-domain datasets. Model-Based Methods. In addition to dataset- level drift metrics, some researchers have explored", "for more precise predictions of how models will generalize to new data, especially in low-resource or highly variable domains. We leverage drift met- rics as a baseline and demonstrate that they are inconsistent for ranking out-of-domain datasets. Model-Based Methods. In addition to dataset- level drift metrics, some researchers have explored the use of model-based methods, such as embed- ding distances, to predict how models perform on new data. Embedding-based methods, particularly those using contextualized representations from models like BERT and RoBERTa, have shown promise in capturing both syntactic and seman- tic shifts between datasets (Feldhans et al., 2021). Elango et al. (2022) found that fine-tuned embed- ding distances are particularly effective for ranking examples by expected performance, as they cap- ture nuances that are missed by simpler, frequency- based metrics. However, while these distances can rank examples well, they are often less reliable at providing accurate performance predictions at the dataset level, particularly in out-of-domain scenar- ios (Nigenda et al., 2022). Finally, model-based methods are limited by fo- cusing either on dataset-level drift or assuming access to labeled data across multiple domains. Ramesh Kashyap et al. (2021) and Patankar et al. (2022) highlight the need for more robust metrics that can work in low-data settings, where labeled data may only be available for a single domain. In such settings, the ability to predict model per- formance at the example level becomes crucial, especially when models need to be deployed in real-time applications. Our work contributes to this gap by leveraging error prediction models trained on one domain and applying them to estimate per- formance across multiple, unseen datasets. By pre- dicting errors made by the base model, we intro- duce a second layer of predictions, which allows for more accurate estimates of model performance across a range of held-out datasets. LLM-as-a-Judge. LLMs are increasingly em- ployed as evaluators, so-called LLMs-as-Judges, to replace or augment human annotation in bench- marking and meta-evaluation tasks (Gu et al., 2024). Early studies showed that models such as GPT-4 can approximate human preferences and provide consistent rankings across diverse tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023). This paradigm has since evolved into both general-purpose evalu- ators and fine-tuned judge models. General LLMs are directly prompted for evaluation, as in AlpacaE- val (Li et al., 2023), while specialized systems such as PandaLM (Wang et al., 2023), JudgeLM (Zhu et al., 2023), and Prometheus (Kim et al., 2023) fine-tune open-source backbones (e.g., Vi- cuna (Touvron et al., 2023b)) on curated evaluation datasets to increase stability and interpretability. Recent work extends these efforts beyond pair- wise comparison toward calibrated, correctness- aware judging. Self-evaluation frameworks like Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) and reasoning- centered evaluation (Hao et al., 2023) integrate judgment into the model\u2019s own feedback loop, allowing iterative refinement of reasoning and decision-making. Meanwhile, meta-evaluation re- search highlights the need to examine how such judges generalize and whether their evaluation sig- nals align with factual correctness rather than stylis- tic or lexical bias (Trung et al., 2024; Zhuge et al., 2024).

Meanwhile, meta-evaluation re- search highlights the need to examine how such judges generalize and whether their evaluation sig- nals align with factual correctness rather than stylis- tic or lexical bias (Trung et al., 2024; Zhuge et al., 2024). Despite strong correlation with human pref- erence scores, these systems often lack calibration or robustness across domains. Most relevant to our work, recent studies on Generalized Correctness Models argue that LLMs lack privileged \u201cself-knowledge\u201d: a model predict- ing the correctness of its own answers is typically no better than another LLM doing the same task, while training on historical prediction data (and Step 1: Train Models for a Downstream Task on Different Domains Step 2: Create an Error Classification Model Preds Error Preds Estimated Performance Texas Training Data Ohio Training Data Correct Correct Wrong Predict Correct or Wrong New York Data Step 3: Estimate Model Performance on Out-of-Domain data.

In Step 1, base models are trained on source domains (e.g., different cities or product categories) for a downstream classification task. In Step 2, an error- prediction model learns to identify which instances the base model is likely to misclassify. Using these predicted errors, we estimate unlabeled accuracy on new domains and rank datasets by their expected model performance. applying light calibration) yields cross-model cor- rectness predictors that can match or even surpass self-emitted confidences in practice (Xiao et al., 2025). Rather than estimating absolute accuracy, we ask a complementary question: do such correct- ness estimates preserve ordinal relationships across datasets and models? Unlike GCMs, which target calibrated probabilities, we study the robustness of ranking under prediction error. 3 Methodology Our goal is to estimate how well models will per- form across unseen datasets by learning to predict model errors rather than relying on direct evalu- ation. As illustrated in Figure 2, our approach proceeds in four stages: (1) train a base model on a downstream classification task, (2) collect instance-level errors from this model, (3) train a secondary model (i.e., an error predictor) to predict those errors, and (4) use the predictions to estimate and rank the performance of models across multi- ple held-out datasets. We explore both supervised classifiers and LLMs in each stage, enabling us to compare traditional learning and LLM-as-a-judge paradigms under a unified framework. Formally, let D(k) = {(xi, yi)}nk i=1 denote a dataset from domain k, and let f\u03b8 denote a model trained on labeled data Dtrain. The model produces predictions \u02c6yi = f\u03b8(xi) on held-out data Dtest. We define the instance-level error as ei = \u22ae[yi \u0338= \u02c6yi]. Our objective is to estimate dataset-level perfor- mance p(k)\u2014e.g., accuracy or F1\u2014without direct access to yi, using the predicted probability of cor- rectness from an auxiliary model g\u03d5. Step 1: Training the Base Model. The first step is to train or prompt a model to perform the target classification task. For smaller models, such as RoBERTa-base, we fine-tune parameters \u03b8 using", "F1\u2014without direct access to yi, using the predicted probability of cor- rectness from an auxiliary model g\u03d5. Step 1: Training the Base Model. The first step is to train or prompt a model to perform the target classification task. For smaller models, such as RoBERTa-base, we fine-tune parameters \u03b8 using standard cross-entropy loss: Ltask(\u03b8) = \u22121 n n X i=1 yi log f\u03b8(xi). For LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini and LLaMa 3.1 8B, we instead use few-shot prompting. Each model\u2019s outputs \u02c6yi and confidence scores (when available) serve as the foundation for error analysis in later steps. See the Appendix for the complete prompts. Step 2: Learning to Predict Errors. Next, we train a second model g\u03d5 to predict whether a given instance will be correctly classified by f\u03b8. This model is conceptually similar to a gener- alized correctness model (Xiao et al., 2025): it estimates g\u03d5(xi) \u2248P(ei = 1 | xi) using ei- ther fine-tuned encoders or instruction-tuned LLMs prompted for binary correctness judgments (e.g., \u201cWill the model\u2019s answer likely be correct or in- correct?\u201d). For smaller models, g\u03d5 is trained via binary cross-entropy loss: Lerror(\u03d5) = \u22121 n n X i=1 [ei log g\u03d5(xi)+ (1 \u2212ei) log(1 \u2212g\u03d5(xi))]. When using LLMs as error predictors, we replace supervised training with in-context exemplars of correct and incorrect predictions and prompt the LLM to judge correctness. This enables direct comparison between learned error predictors and judgment-based estimations. See the Appendix for the complete prompts. Step 3: Estimating Dataset-Level Performance. Given the predicted error classes, we estimate the expected accuracy on a new dataset D(k) as \u02c6p(k) = 1 \u2212 1 |D(k)| X (xi,yi)\u2208D(k) 1[g\u03d5(xi) > 0.5], which intuitively counts the number of predicted errors in the dataset. This provides a label-free proxy for model performance on unseen domains or datasets. For the LLMs, this is simply the pre- diction without any thresholding. Performance Ranking Evaluation. To evaluate the overall method, we measure the correlation between the predicted performance \u02c6p(k) and the true performance p(k) across all held-out datasets. We compute the Spearman rank (Spearman, 1961) correlation coefficient \u03c1 to quantify the relationship between predicted and true performance and rank datasets, \u03c1 = Pm k=1(p(k) \u2212\u00afp)(\u02c6p(k) \u2212\u00af\u02c6p) qPm k=1(p(k) \u2212\u00afp)2 qPm k=1(\u02c6p(k) \u2212\u00af\u02c6p)2 where \u00afp and \u00af\u02c6p are the means of the true and pre- dicted performance scores across all datasets. High correlation values indicate that our method accu- rately estimates model performance across diverse datasets, even in out-of-domain scenarios. The metric we used in our experiments is Accuracy for consistency with prior work (Chang et al., 2023). 4 Results We present the results of our experiments, where we evaluate the performance of models trained on different cities and test their generalization across other cities. Our key evaluation metrics are accu- racy and the correlation between the estimated and true accuracy across the held-out datasets. Baseline Models. Our baseline classifiers for pre- dicting offensive language and sentiment across both datasets include three models of increasing complexity. (1) A Linear model, which uses lex- ical and confidence-based features (details in the Appendix). (2) A RoBERTa-base model,", "between the estimated and true accuracy across the held-out datasets. Baseline Models. Our baseline classifiers for pre- dicting offensive language and sentiment across both datasets include three models of increasing complexity. (1) A Linear model, which uses lex- ical and confidence-based features (details in the Appendix). (2) A RoBERTa-base model, fine- tuned for each task using standard cross-entropy loss (training details in the Appendix). (3) A LLaMa-3.1-8B model evaluated in a few-shot set- ting, where task-specific examples are provided through in-context prompting (the full prompt is shown in the Appendix). Baselines Error Models/Methods. We evaluate four baselines that estimate performance without la- beled data, matching the names used in Tables 1\u20132. The Zero-Shot Baseline uses GPT-4o-mini to pro- duce label predictions directly; we treat the model\u2019s confidence for the predicted label as a proxy for correctness and average these probabilities within each domain to obtain an estimated accuracy (cf. OpenAI 2023). The Semantic Drift baseline mea- sures semantic proximity between predicted and reference label texts using SBERT embeddings (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). For each example i we compute the maximum cosine similarity over candidate labels,si = maxy\u2208Y cos \u0000e\u02c6yi, ey \u0001 , and estimate domain-level performance by averaging these scores, \u02c6Ad = 1 Nd PNd i=1 si. The RoBERTa baseline trains a ROBERTA-base error model (Liu, 2019) to predict whether a base classifier\u2019s output is correct given the input and predicted label; we av- erage predicted correctness probabilities over each domain at inference. The Linear Model baseline is a logistic regression error model ngram features; as with RoBERTa, we average predicted correctness to estimate accuracy. Training and optimization details for the learned error models are in the Ap- pendix. Datasets. We use two datasets in our study: GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews 2023. GeoOLID. The GeoOLID dataset was introduced by Lwowski et al. (2022) and used to investigate the geographic performance disparities of offen- sive language classifiers. GeoOLID contains over 14,000 annotated examples of tweets from 15 ge- ographically and demographically diverse cities across the United States. The regional variability of language use presented in this dataset allows for studying the effect of linguistic and topical dif- ferences on model accuracies. We leverage these variations to test whether our base classifier mod- els can accurately predict offensive language when trained on one city. Amazon Reviews 2023. The second dataset used in our study is the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset introduced by Hou et al. (2024). This dataset comprises over 570 million reviews and 48 mil- lion items across 33 product categories.

Each review in the dataset is paired with detailed product metadata, including titles, features, and descrip- tions. This sampled subset facilitates exploring the relationship between textual reviews and item metadata for recommendation and retrieval tasks. We can use it to understand how sentiment (product rating) prediction models perform across different products. Variation Study Figures 8 and 4 present vari- ation studies that analyze how ranking reliability changes when we systematically (synthetically at random) increase the difference in true accuracy between the best and worst performing domains. These figures are on the Amazon dataset; see the Appendix for GeoOLID results that follow a sim- ilar pattern. Intuitively, we start with completely 0.66 0.67 0.68 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 Mean Actual Accuracy 0 5 10 15 20 25 Count Mean = 0.700 +1 SD = 0.716 -1 SD = 0.685 Figure 5: Histogram showing the base model accuracy ranges with their respective statistics on the Amazon Dataset. 0.74 0.76 0.78 0.80 0.82 0.84 0.86 0.88 Mean Actual Accuracy 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Count Mean = 0.810 +1 SD = 0.838 -1 SD = 0.782 Figure 6: Histogram showing the base model accuracy ranges with their respective statistics on the GeoOLID Dataset. correct predictions for one city/domain, and then for each subsequent city/domain, we add errors to the predictions. We explore two conditions: (1) er- rors are injected at random across all instances, and (2) errors are added only to examples where the error model originally predicted a mistake. These two settings allow us to test whether ranking corre- lations remain stable when the true accuracy gap of what we are trying to estimate widens uniformly. In the random setting (Figure 4, correlations rise gradually as the difference in true accuracy increases, showing that larger performance gaps make it easier to identify correct rankings. When errors are injected based on the error model\u2019s orig- inal mistakes (Figure 8), the ranking correlations remain more stable, suggesting that the model\u2019s in- ternal error patterns capture some real structure in where performance decays. Together, these results indicate that reliable ranking depends not only on Bal. Chi. Col. Det. EP Hou. Ind. LA Mem. Mia. NO NY Phi. Pho.

Figures 6 and 5 display histograms of the true performance distributions for the Amazon and GeoOLID datasets, respectively. Each histogram shows the mean and one standard deviation range of base model accuracies across all domains. The Amazon dataset (mean = 0.70, SD = 0.015) has a narrow and concentrated accuracy range, while GeoOLID (mean = 0.81, SD = 0.028) exhibits a wider and more uniform distribution. These dif- ferences", "histogram shows the mean and one standard deviation range of base model accuracies across all domains. The Amazon dataset (mean = 0.70, SD = 0.015) has a narrow and concentrated accuracy range, while GeoOLID (mean = 0.81, SD = 0.028) exhibits a wider and more uniform distribution. These dif- ferences explain why ranking results are stronger for GeoOLID: when performance values are more spread out, correlations between predicted and true rankings are easier to recover. In contrast, the Ama- zon accuracies are tightly clustered, so even small estimation errors can change the rank order. Real Data Results. Tables 1 and 2 present the Spearman rank correlation between estimated and true model performance across different domains. Each value represents how well the ranking pro- duced by the error-prediction method aligns with the actual ranking of accuracies across cities in GeoOLID or product categories in Amazon Re- views. The average scores at the rightmost column are computed across all training domains. For com- parison, the baseline results are the average of three approaches: semantic drift, covariate shift, and a zero-shot baseline. These baselines capture how similarity-based or unsupervised methods perform when no explicit error modeling is used. Table 1 reports results on GeoOLID. The base- line measures yield weak or inconsistent results, with average correlations below .30 across all three baselines. In contrast, the error-prediction ap- proaches show much stronger and more stable cor- relations. The large language model predictors perform best, with LLaMa-3.1-8B and Gemma-3- 12B-it achieving average correlations of .625 and .635, respectively. These models capture consistent ranking differences across cities such as Houston (.707) and Memphis (.562), indicating that rank- ing reliability improves when true accuracy differ- ences are larger and geographically structured. The smaller RoBERTa and linear models perform less consistently, averaging .419 and .126, respectively, suggesting that they capture less of the structure in regional variation. Table 2 shows results for the Amazon product review dataset. Here, ranking performance is no- tably weaker, with most correlations close to zero. The Linear model and LLaMa-3.1-8B again per- form best, with average correlations of .346 and .392, while other models show low or negative values. This pattern aligns with the narrow accu- racy distribution seen in Figure 5, where accura- cies cluster near 0.70 with a standard deviation of only .015. When the range of true performance is small, small prediction errors can easily change rank order, leading to unstable results. In contrast, Figure 6 shows a wider spread in GeoOLID ac- curacies (mean = 0.81, SD = 0.028), producing stronger signals for ranking. The relatively strong performance of the Linear model aligns with the Semantic Drift baseline, as both rely on shallow lex- ical or confidence-based cues that generalize well across categories. These features capture broad sentiment polarity and stylistic consistency across product types, allowing both methods to recover smooth, monotonic estimates even when absolute performance differences are minimal. Together, these findings align with the variation studies in Figures 4 and 8. When we artificially increased the difference in true accuracy across do- mains, Spearman correlations rose from roughly .2", "consistency across product types, allowing both methods to recover smooth, monotonic estimates even when absolute performance differences are minimal. Together, these findings align with the variation studies in Figures 4 and 8. When we artificially increased the difference in true accuracy across do- mains, Spearman correlations rose from roughly .2 to .8 in GeoOLID-like conditions, especially when variations matched the model\u2019s original errors. This supports the hypothesis that ranking reliability de- pends jointly on the magnitude of true performance variation and the alignment between predicted and actual error patterns. The higher and more con- sistent correlations in GeoOLID, compared to the tightly clustered results in Amazon, confirm that ranking becomes more reliable when underlying performance differences are broader and system- atically captured by the error models. As shown in Appendix Table 4, the Linear and GPT-4o-mini error models achieve the highest accuracies across datasets (.734 and .825 for Amazon and GeoOLID, respectively), demonstrating that even simple mod- els can effectively capture structured error variation. These results reinforce that performance prediction benefits from both model-informed error structure and sufficient spread in true accuracies, which to- gether enable more stable ranking across domains. Implications. Ranking performance depends on two main factors: the size of true performance differences across domains and the accuracy of the error predictions. When these conditions hold, rankings are more stable and reliable. We also find that the accuracy of the error models correlates with overall task performance, suggesting that better error estimation supports more trustworthy model evaluation without labels. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we introduced a framework for pre- dicting model performance across diverse datasets using paired base and error models. Base classifiers are first trained on source domains, and secondary error models are trained to predict where those classifiers will fail on unseen data. We evaluated this dual-model setup across multiple datasets and architectures, measuring how well the predicted rankings align with true performance without using labeled evaluation data. Our findings show that reliable performance ranking depends on two interacting factors: the amount of true variation in accuracy across do- mains and the alignment between predicted and actual error patterns. In datasets such as GeoOLID, where accuracies are more widely distributed, large language model predictors like Gemma-3-12B-it and LLaMa-3.1-8B achieved average correlations above .62, effectively recovering the relative or- dering of model performance. In contrast, when accuracies are tightly clustered, as in the Amazon dataset (mean = 0.70, SD = 0.015), ranking relia- bility declines, and simpler models such as the Lin- ear error model perform competitively by capturing lexical and confidence-based regularities similar to those exploited by the Semantic Drift baseline. These results suggest that strong ranking perfor- mance does not necessarily require complex mod- eling capacity but benefits most from structured variation in the underlying task space. Taken together, our results establish a founda- tion for label-free performance estimation that can guide model selection and deployment across do- mains. By quantifying when and how model pre- dictions can be used to rank expected accuracy, this framework provides a scalable and interpretable alternative to exhaustive retraining and", "space.

First, the reliability of ranking depends on how well the error models capture model failures. These predictors may not represent all sources of variation in generalization, especially when data are highly imbalanced or differ in structure. Sec- ond, our experiments focus on classification tasks and two datasets, which limits how far the find- ings can be extended to other types of problems. Third, some domains in our study are more uniform than others, which may influence how correlations appear. Future work can test whether these pat- terns hold in more diverse domains, larger model families, or tasks such as text generation and multi- modal learning.

To address this chal- lenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recogni- tion pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram- based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strat- egy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

INTRODUCTION Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have evolved from providing transcription services for virtual assistants to enabling sophisticated healthcare applications [1]. This development demonstrates the critical role of ASR systems in enhancing accessibility and efficiency across various do- mains. Recent advancements in transformer-based models, such as the Whisper family, have significantly improved ASR performance by leveraging deep learning techniques to capture complex speech patterns [2]. These models have shown remarkable performance in transcribing spoken lan- guage across diverse contexts, including noisy environments and spontaneous conversations [3]. However, despite their effectiveness, they indicate notable sensitivity to accent and dialect variations, particularly in linguistically diverse lan- guages like English and Persian [4]. This sensitivity often results in high Word Error Rates (WER) when processing speech from speakers with non-native or regional accents, thereby limiting the accessibility and effectiveness of ASR technologies in global applications [5]. Accents encapsulate unique phonetic and prosodic fea- tures that can obscure the underlying linguistic content, pos- ing a substantial challenge for ASR systems trained mostly on standard or homogeneous datasets. These variations can lead to misinterpretations of phonemes and intonations, which are crucial for accurate speech recognition. Traditional ap- proaches to mitigating accent-related discrepancies involve augmenting training datasets with diverse speech samples or fine-tuning models on accent-specific data [5,6]. While these methods can improve performance, they often demand exten- sive data collection and may not generalize well to unseen accents or dialects, making them resource-intensive and less scalable. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose a saliency-driven spectrogram masking framework that leverages", "models on accent-specific data [5,6].

Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose a saliency-driven spectrogram masking framework that leverages Grad-CAM to identify accent- sensitive regions and suppress them, enabling ASR models to focus on accent-neutral linguistic features. \u2022 We design a lightweight, model-agnostic training strat- egy that improves robustness to both known and unseen ac- cents without requiring architectural modifications or full model retraining. \u2022 We introduce the Persian Dialect IDentification (PDID), a new multi-accent corpus covering 10 regional Persian ac- cents, providing the first systematic benchmark for Persian accent robustness. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on English (LibriSpeech, EdAcc, CommonAccent) and Persian (CommonVoice- fa, PDID), showing that our method consistently reduces arXiv:2510.09528v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 WER/CER over SpecAugment baselines on accented speech [7\u2013 10]. 2. RELATED WORK Recent advances in transformer-based ASR models such as Whisper [2] have significantly improved speech recognition across noisy and spontaneous conditions. However, these models still exhibit notable sensitivity to accent and dialectal variations, with disproportionately high WER for non-native and regional speakers [4]. More recently, large language model (LLM)-based ap- proaches have been integrated into ASR pipelines to enhance robustness under accented and conversational speech [11,12]. While these methods leverage powerful contextual reasoning to improve recognition, they drastically increase computa- tional and memory costs, making them impractical for real- time or resource-constrained deployment. Moreover, their ef- fectiveness diminishes in low-resource languages where train- ing data and linguistic coverage are limited, reducing their utility for accent-heavy domains such as Persian. A growing body of work focuses on enhancing accent robustness. Parameter-efficient adaptation methods like Mix- ture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA) [13] deploy accent-specialized LoRA experts, achieving improvements on accented corpora without full model retraining. Com- plementary to this, Qifusion-Net [14] introduces a layer- adapted fusion strategy that dynamically integrates multi- accent acoustic features, reducing CER by over 20% on large-scale benchmarks. Beyond architecture, spectrogram manipulation and aug- mentation strategies remain underexplored for accent mitiga- tion. While supervised contrastive learning has been applied to accented speech [15], direct masking of accent-related spectrogram regions has yet to be widely investigated\u2014a gap our work explicitly targets to inject gradient information to the pipeline. 3. METHODOLOGY This section details the proposed methodology for enhanc- ing accent invariance in ASR systems. Our approach inte- grates accent and dialect classification into the ASR training pipeline through a multi-step process involving spectrogram- based classification, Grad-CAM for the localization of accent features, spectrogram masking, and fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model on augmented data. The following subsections elaborate on each component of the method. 3.1. PDID Dataset We collected speech samples from 10 regional Persian ac- cents (Isfahani, Yazdi, Lori, Kurdish, Balochi, Southern, Northern, Tajiki, Mashhadi, and Shirazi) using sources Fig. 1. Overview of our accent suppression pipeline. First, the spectrogram is used to classify accents and generate a Grad-CAM saliency map highlighting accent-specific fea- tures. Next, a masking strategy is applied to", "regional Persian ac- cents (Isfahani, Yazdi, Lori, Kurdish, Balochi, Southern, Northern, Tajiki, Mashhadi, and Shirazi) using sources Fig. 1. Overview of our accent suppression pipeline. First, the spectrogram is used to classify accents and generate a Grad-CAM saliency map highlighting accent-specific fea- tures. Next, a masking strategy is applied to suppress these accent-related regions while preserving essential information. Finally, the modified spectrogram is fed into the ASR model to improve generalization across diverse accents. such as local TV/radio and online platforms like Aparat and YouTube. Following a pipeline similar to the EMILIA dataset [16], we applied preprocessing steps including voice activity detection, speaker diarization, silence-based seg- mentation, and speech\u2013music separation. All samples were standardized to 16kHz, mono-channel, 16-bit WAV format with normalized loudness, and segmented into 3\u201330 second clips. After quality filtering, about 23 hours of clean accent- labeled data remained from 200+ hours of raw speech, with Tajiki, Shirazi, and Balochi accents included only in the test set for robustness evaluation. Table 1 shows the distribution of samples and hours across the training accents. 3.2. Accent Classification on Spectrograms To effectively identify accent-specific features within speech data, we first train an accent classifier using spectrogram rep- resentations of the input audio. Spectrograms provide a com- prehensive visualization of the frequency content of speech signals over time, capturing both phonetic and prosodic char- acteristics essential for distinguishing accents. We utilize a diverse dataset comprising speech samples from various accents and dialects of English. The resulting spectrograms are normalized to ensure consistent input scales Table 1.

Number of Samples per Class in the Dataset Class Number of Samples Standard 1000 Southern British 965 Irish 704 Italian 443 Egyptian 346 Vietnamese 332 Total 3790 for the classifier. Our accent classification dataset includes samples from the Edinburgh dataset for Southern British, Irish, Egyptian, and Italian and the LibriSpeech dataset for Standard English [7,8]. Table 2 contains the exact number of samples per accent. For accent classification, we utilize a convolutional neu- ral network (CNN) architecture consisting of multiple convo- lutional layers with ReLU activations and max-pooling lay- ers to capture hierarchical acoustic features. More specifi- cally, the architecture inputs normalized spectrograms of size 80 \u00d7 3000, where 80 is the number of frequency bins and 3000 is the number of time frames. Furthermore, four convo- lutional layers with 32, 64, 128, and 256 filters of size 3 \u00d7 3, each followed by ReLU activation. Max-pooling layers with a kernel size of 2\u00d72 are applied after certain layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Finally, a flattening layer is fol- lowed by a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, including dropout for regularization, and a fully connected layer maps to the number of accent classes in the dataset. The classifier is trained using the cross-entropy", "and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Finally, a flattening layer is fol- lowed by a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, including dropout for regularization, and a fully connected layer maps to the number of accent classes in the dataset. The classifier is trained using the cross-entropy loss func- tion and optimized with the Adam optimizer. Data augmen- tation techniques such as SpecAugment are applied during training to enhance the classifier\u2019s robustness to variability in speech signals [17]. The final accuracy of the classifier model is 74.6% for English accents. When applied with the same settings to our Persian accented dataset, the classifier achieved accuracy of 95%, 3.3. Masking Strategy To identify the regions in the spectrograms most indicative of accent-specific features, Gradient-weighted Class Activa- tion Mapping (Grad-CAM) is utilized [18], which provides a visual explanation by highlighting the areas of the input that significantly influence the classifier\u2019s decision. Specifically, for each input spectrogram, the gradients of the predicted accent class are computed concerning the fea- ture maps of the last convolutional layer. These gradients are then global-average-pooled to obtain weights, combined with the corresponding feature maps to produce a heatmap high- lighting the salient regions associated with the accent classi- fication. A probabilistic masking strategy based on the normalized Grad-CAM scores is applied to suppress accent-specific fea- tures in the spectrograms. After normalizing the Grad-CAM activation map to obtain scores in the range [0, 1], denoted as C(i, j) for pixel (i, j), a binary threshold mask T(i, j) is defined as: T(i, j) = ( 1, if C(i, j) > 0.3 0, otherwise. (1) Next, random probability map R(i, j) is generated, where each R(i, j) is sampled from a uniform distribution over [0, 1]. Furthermore, U(A, B) declares sampling from a ran- dom uniform distribution over [A, B]. The final mask M(i, j) is computed as: M(i, j) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 1, if T(i, j) = 0 1, if C(i, j) \u22650.7 and R(i, j) > 1 1, if 0.5 \u2264C(i, j) < 0.7 and R(i, j) > U(0.7, 0.9) 1, if C(i, j) < 0.5 and R(i, j) > U(0, 0.05) 0, otherwise. (2) In this strategy: \u2022 If a pixel belongs to the region where T(i, j) = 0, it always remains unchanged. \u2022 If a pixel is located in a region that is considered strongly accent-related (C(i, j) \u22650.7) all such pixels are masked. \u2022 If a pixel belongs to the region with a moderate to high score (0.5 \u2264C(i, j) < 0.7), it is masked with a prob- ability between 0.7 and 0.9 using a uniform probabil- ity distribution (U(0.7, 0.9)), This ensures that nonrel- evant pixels have a chance to be included in accent- related features, thereby reducing errors to some extent. \u2022 If a pixel falls within the low to moderate score (C(i, j) < 0.5), it is masked with a probability be- tween U(0, 0.05), to account for accent-related regions that might have been mistakenly assigned", "chance to be included in accent- related features, thereby reducing errors to some extent. \u2022 If a pixel falls within the low to moderate score (C(i, j) < 0.5), it is masked with a probability be- tween U(0, 0.05), to account for accent-related regions that might have been mistakenly assigned a low score, thus mitigating errors to some extent.

(3) This probabilistic masking strategy ensures that accent- related features are suppressed while retaining essential lin- guistic information, enhancing the ASR model\u2019s ability to generalize across different accents. As shown in Figure 1, the original spectrogram, Grad-CAM activation map, and masked spectrogram illustrate the accent feature localization and suppression process. The masked spectrograms are combined with the primary dataset to form an augmented training dataset. This augmen- tation encourages the ASR model to learn accent-neutral rep- resentations by exposing it to accented and accent-suppressed versions of the same speech samples. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art transformer-based ASR model to improve its robustness in accent and dialect variations. 4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We conducted experiments on both English and Persian datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed accent- aware masking method. As Table 3 shows For English, we used LibriSpeech, EdAcc, and CommonAccent, while Table 4 shows for Persian we used the CommonVoice (fa) sub- set along with our newly collected accented dataset PDID. Training was performed on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs using AdamW optimizer, with learning rates of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 for tiny and 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 for base/medium models, batch sizes of 32, 16, and 4 respectively, and 10 epochs. The evaluation met- rics were WER and CER, complemented by ablations using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ to generate accent-masking policies. Results show that our method significantly outper- forms both pre-trained Whisper", "for tiny and 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 for base/medium models, batch sizes of 32, 16, and 4 respectively, and 10 epochs. The evaluation met- rics were WER and CER, complemented by ablations using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ to generate accent-masking policies. Results show that our method significantly outper- forms both pre-trained Whisper and LibriSpeech fine-tuned baselines, as well as a SpecAugment baseline, particularly in accented and unseen-accent settings [19]. For Persian, fine-tuning on CommonVoice (fa) improves performance, but our accent-masked approach yields further gains across both base and medium sizes. Overall, these results confirm that accent-masked train- ing consistently reduces CER and WER across both English and Persian. The improvements are particularly strong on un- seen accents, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method. 5. CONCLUSION We proposed a saliency-driven spectrogram masking frame- work that uses Grad-CAM to suppress accent-specific fea- tures and encourage ASR models to learn accent-neutral rep- resentations. Our approach is lightweight, model-agnostic, and improves robustness without architectural modifications or full retraining. In addition, we introduced the PDID dataset, the first multi-accent benchmark for Persian ASR covering 10 regional dialects. Experiments on English and Persian showed consistent WER/CER reductions, with rel- ative gains up to 14% on accented speech compared to SpecAugment baselines. These results confirm that targeted spectrogram masking is an effective strategy for accent-robust ASR. 6.

Prior designs of penaliza- tion in RLVR manage to reduce token consump- tion while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token- level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize rea- soning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior to- ken efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL train- ing and scales effectively across model sizes. 1 Introduction Test-time Scaling with RLVR has greatly acceler- ated the development and adoption of Large Rea- soning Models (LRMs) (Team et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025a; Yu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). During inference, LRMs typically exhibit a distinct behavior from normal post-trained LLMs: they first produce a reasoning trajectory before generating the final response. Unlike conventional Chain-of- Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022), such trajectories often involve exploration and self-reflection over mul- tiple possible solution paths, and gradually reach the final answer. However, this pattern can also lead LRMs to overthink, or repeatedly explore and * Project lead. \u2020 Corresponding author. revise their paths, resulting in excessively long de- coding sequences and huge computational costs. Recent works treat this issue from the algorith- mic perspective, introducing additional supervision on token efficiency within RLVR. For example, Aggarwal and Welleck (2025) penalizes samples whose output length exceeds that of the reference responses. However, while such methods effec- tively reduce token consumption, they also com- promise the benefits of Test-time Scaling, leading to a significant degradation in LRM performance. Compressing the reasoning content essentially means removing redundant parts of the thought process. For humans, it first requires the ability to be aware of the redundant content before making a decision. When each token is considered as the candidate to remove, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), it is difficult to identify which specific tokens are unnecessary, since most tokens cannot be directly associated with the sparse verifier reward and rec- ognized as high-value tokens. On the other hand, arbitrarily removing tokens is not feasible either, as they are still essential to preserve the readability and coherence of the reasoning. This motivates us to reconsider the granularity of supervision for bal- ancing computational cost and task performance, and we find intermediate steps/segments can be a more natural unit. As shown in Figure 1(b), hu- mans can more easily", "are still essential to preserve the readability and coherence of the reasoning. This motivates us to reconsider the granularity of supervision for bal- ancing computational cost and task performance, and we find intermediate steps/segments can be a more natural unit. As shown in Figure 1(b), hu- mans can more easily identify a redundant step than an individual token, since each step typically carries a semantically coherent piece of thought. Building on this insight, we propose to supervise the reasoning process at the segment level, enabling stable control of LRM reasoning behavior. In this work, we introduce Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a novel method that balances computational efficiency and task per- formance by operating at the reasoning-step granu- larity. As a foundation, our observations on open- source LRMs reveal that the quantity of segments is positively correlated with token consumption, 1 arXiv:2510.09535v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 LLM Reasoning: <think>Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry ...

(a) Identifying redundant tokens is challenging, as most of them are weakly correlated with the golden answer; (b) Identifying redundant steps is much easier for its clearer meaning. while they are easier to assess for redundancy, mak- ing them a more reasonable target for penalization. Further preliminary analyses indicate a statistical relationship between the performance of LRMs and the distribution of segment lengths: stronger mod- els tend to exhibit more balanced segment-length distributions. It suggests a chance to mitigate per- formance degradation by applying length-aware penalties: penalizing segment counts within each length cluster and assigning decreasing weights for longer segments. We conduct extensive experiments comparing GRSP with baselines and demonstrate its advan- tages in both token efficiency and accuracy. No- tably, as task difficulty increases, together with longer reasoning, the advantages of GRSP become even clearer. We also analyze the impact of the weighting mechanism. Although it appears to con- tradict the intuition of encouraging shorter seg- ments to minimize token count, our results show that it ultimately saves the cost and stabilizes RL training. Moreover, we investigate the effect of different segmentation strategies and evaluate the scalability of our approach across model sizes. Our work can be summarized into three aspects: (1) We first address the granularity of supervision in mitigating overthinking, proposing step-level supervision, and conducting preliminary analyses that uncover correlated features.

This pattern has been further scaled by recent RL work, such as Kimi-k1.5 (Team et al., 2025) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025a). Given the prompt x \u223cD and corresponding responses {y|y = yt \u223c\u03c0\u03b8old}, the goal T is to maximizes the expected verifiable reward, T = arg max \u03c0\u03b8 Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(x)R(x, y) (1) where \u03c0 is the policy and R is the accuracy signal obtained from a deterministic verifier. Prevalent algorithms include Reinforce L =Ex\u223cD,Y \u223c\u03c0\u03b8old 1 |Y | X yi\u2208Y 1 |yi| X yi t \u0002 Ai,t \u2217\u03c0\u03b8 \u0000yi t|x, yi <t \u0001\u0003 (2) and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), which adds an importance-sampling ratio r(x, yt, y<t) = \u03c0\u03b8(yt|x, y<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(yt|x, y<t) (3) and a clip operator inherited from PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). It also replaces the token-level advan- tage Ai,t with a sequence-level score Ai Ai = R(x, yi) \u2212Eyj\u2208Y [R(x, yj)] std[R(x, yj)] (4) Despite its effectiveness, RLVR produces unneces- sarily long thinking content. A common remedy is to augment R with a token-length penalty R\u2032 = R \u2299P({yt}) (5) where P penalises the total number of generated tokens. It shortens the output but also degrades accuracy. 2 x : segments : segments : segments Rollout Samples cluster k: cluster 1: cluster K: Clusters of Segments Acc Reward Group Relative Penalty Overall RLVR Update \ud83d\udd25 Descending Weighting Segmentation Supervision Problem Bank Selection Veriable Reward Length Penalty Cluster Penalty Judge Problem Policy Model Figure 2: The overall workflow of GRSP.

We first introduce the core segment-count penalty (\u00a7 3.1), then extend it with length-group weights based on our observations of reasoning cases (\u00a7 3.2). Finally, we describe our segmen- tation methods (\u00a7 3.3). The overall workflow of GRSP is illustrated in Figure 2. 3.1 Penalization on Segments Mitigating overthinking essentially means com- pressing the thinking content. As shown in Fig- ure 1, identifying redundant tokens is often am- biguous. However, distinct steps, i.e., trajectory segments within the reasoning process, can serve as a natural higher-level unit, as also adopted by Guo et al. (2025b). Moreover, our investigation of several open-source", "means com- pressing the thinking content. As shown in Fig- ure 1, identifying redundant tokens is often am- biguous. However, distinct steps, i.e., trajectory segments within the reasoning process, can serve as a natural higher-level unit, as also adopted by Guo et al. (2025b). Moreover, our investigation of several open-source LRMs reveals a clear positive correlation between the quantity of segments and total token consumption (see Table 1). Therefore, by decomposing the thinking content into segments {si}, we can indirectly reduce token usage by dis- couraging unnecessary steps. To be specific, for a single prompt x and a corre- sponding response group Y = {yj} sampled from \u03c0\u03b8old, let sij denote the trajectory segments in re- sponse yj. We then compute the z-score of the segment count inside the group Y for each yj \u2208Y , and treat its negative value as the penalty, which requires no task-specific threshold: P(yj) = \u2212|{si}j| \u2212Ey\u2208Y [|{si}|] std[|{si}|] (6) 3.2 Group Relative Penalization Simply changing the granularity of penalization from tokens to trajectory segments does not solve the problem in \u00a72, because the performance gain of an LRM over an ordinary post-trained model comes directly from generated-token scaling, and any mechanism that shortens the reasoning conse- quently risks a sharp drop in performance. To be specific in the RL setting, continued im- provement on downstream performance is usually obtained by stable training or more optimization steps (Yu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). However, introducing a length penalty can destabilise it: there is a phenomenon that once the response length ex- ceeds a certain point, the penalty dominates and gradually the training collapses with task accuracy drifting downward. Hence, how to discourage over- length thinking while keeping the training process stable becomes the central question. We investigate the above LRMs again for sta- tistical signatures that correlate with these two re- quirements. We further hypothesize that model performance is correlated with the extent of train- ing, i.e., stronger models tend to undergo more training, which in turn suggests greater training stability. In detail, using the RL problems in \u00a7 4.1, we roll out a batch of responses for each model. For these responses, we segment the thinking con- tent and group the segments into five clusters by length, where segments longer than 300 tokens are excluded, as they rarely occur. Since this exper- iment is related to model performance, we apply the above procedure separately to passed and failed 3 (a) DeepSeek-R1 (b) QwQ-32B (c) DS-Qwen-Distill-32B (d) DS-Qwen-Distill-14B 0.2 1.2 0.7 Figure 3: The ratio of segment counts across each cluster (correct vs. wrong). Longer segments are generally more prevalent in correct cases, and stronger models (a, b) exhibit flatter slopes compared to weaker ones (c, d). cases, and compute the average number of seg- ments in each cluster for the two sides. Intuitively, we find that failed cases tend to contain more seg- ments across most clusters. We then calculate, for each length cluster, the ratio of the average number of segments from the passed side to that from the failed side. The", "seg- ments in each cluster for the two sides. Intuitively, we find that failed cases tend to contain more seg- ments across most clusters. We then calculate, for each length cluster, the ratio of the average number of segments from the passed side to that from the failed side. The results are shown in Figure 3. This experiment leads to several findings: (1) It is a general trend that failed cases contain more segments than passed ones. (2) Errors of LRMs in problem solving can be as- sociated with the presence of relatively shorter seg- ments in the thinking content. In detail, the dif- ference between passed and failed cases is larger in shorter-length clusters (with lower ratios in Fig- ure 3), while the difference decreases in longer- length clusters (with higher ratios). It is a shared pattern for all examined LRMs. (3) A potential link between model performance (+ training stability) and a more balanced distribution of segments can exist. Stronger models show a smaller variation in this ratio across clusters, which is reflected in a smaller slope of the linear fit. Based on these observations, we propose stabi- lizing RL training by explicitly shaping the distribu- tion of segments through segment-level penalties, which we term Reasoning Shaping. Concretely, following the procedure above, we first split the thinking content into segments and cluster them by length. For each cluster k, we compute a relative penalty using a z-score normalization: P k(yj) = \u2212|sk i j| \u2212Ey\u2208Y [|sk i |] std[|sk i |] (7) The overall penalty is then obtained by weighting across clusters: P(yj) = X k wkP k(yj) (8) Following the findings above, we penalize short segments more heavily, while applying weaker penalties to longer ones. To achieve this, we assign descending weights from shorter to longer clusters. The final reward is then given by: R\u2032 = R + \u03b1P(yj) (9) 3.3 Segmentation We design two mechanisms for segmentation. The first is keyword-based matching, similar to Guo et al. (2025b). We collect a list of keywords from typical reasoning cases to identify potential seg- ment boundaries. It is used by default for concise- ness and high computational efficiency, while its applicability is limited to specific languages. The second mechanism is token log-probability matching. Following observations in Li et al. (2024); Song et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025a), segment boundaries often correspond to local min- ima in token log-probabilities. This is because segment transitions usually admit more candidate continuations, leading to lower confidence at the beginning of a new segment. Based on it, we locate boundaries by identifying these local minima. We implement and test it in \u00a7 4.6. 4 Experiment 4.1 Experimental Setup The training pipeline consists of two post-training stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RLVR. For SFT, problems are collected from Nu- minaMATH (LI et al., 2024), while completions of reasoning and response are O1-mini patterned examples, following the prompt-engineering pro- cedure of Gao et al. (2025b). We utilize these data to warm up the base LLM and to establish a strong initialization for subsequent RL.

Dur- ing RL, models are trained with Reinforce and GRPO, with the addition of a length penalty. 4.2 Evaluation For evaluation, we construct three test sets with increasing difficulty: 500 problems from MATH 500, 10 challenging problems from AIMO Prize-1, and 500 difficult problems from Omni-MATH 500, which enables us to compute general scores and analyze how task difficulty influences model be- havior and token efficiency. Hence, we report two metrics: task performance measured by accuracy and token efficiency measured by the average num- ber of decoding tokens per example. We compare GRSP with two baselines: (1) LCPO (Aggarwal and Welleck, 2025) uses the ratio between the generated response length and the reference one as a weighting factor for the veri- fiable reward, reducing the sparsity of reward distri- bution and introducing a direct correlation between reward and token usage.

We first evaluate four open-source LRMs introduced in \u00a7 3.1. Although all of them exhibit strong performance, there remains a clear gap between DeepSeek-R1/QwQ-32B and the two distill models. Notably, with 671B parameters, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates remarkable token ef- ficiency, suggesting that stronger base capability can contribute to more concise reasoning. In ad- dition, the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-14B-it\u2217achieves a substantial improvement over Qwen-2.5-14B-it, highlighting the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Overall, GRSP achieves the best scores on both task performance and token efficiency under both GRPO and REINFORCE frameworks. Notably, on the most challenging Omni-MATH 500, GRSP achieves the most significant reduction in token us- age while maintaining the highest accuracy among all baselines, even matching or surpassing the naive RL version (Reinforce + GRSP). Although LCPO also performs competitively, it fails to deliver no- ticeable gains in token efficiency. We further analyze how token length correlates with task difficulty. For all methods, token over- 5 Training Step Acc Avg Len Training Step Avg Seg Len Training Step (a) (b) (c) Figure 4: Comparison of two weighting strategies.

RL accentuates this trend, as the token growth on Omni-MATH is much larger than on easier benchmarks, and GRSP primarily reduces token usage on such problems, where overthinking is most likely to occur, while preserving task performance. We also observe distinct segmentation patterns across different methods, which may strongly cor- relate with their results. Using the keyword-based segmentation on all models trained with Reinforce, we find that GRSP produces an average of 21.07 segments, notably fewer than 26.66 from the model trained without additional penalty. This confirms that GRSP effectively regulates the number of rea- soning segments and thus reduces token overhead. In contrast, the two baselines yield substantially more segments of 51.97 and 142.12, respectively, and the largest part is short segments, as the ratio of segments from the cluster of k = 1 is 79.17% and 91.36% for O1-pruner and LCPO, while that for GRSP is 62.61%. We attribute this to the ambi- guity in supervising token length: it disturbs the op- timization on verifiable reward, making the model resort to rapidly iterating short reasoning steps to maintain performance. Such settings not only lead to lower accuracy but also have a larger likelihood of overthinking, as extremely long outputs are ob- served in LCPO. We provide further analyses of this pattern in \u00a7 4.4. 4.4 Ablation on the Weighting Mechanism In this section, we investigate the effect of the pro- posed weighting mechanism across segment clus- ters. By default, the penalty weight decreases with the cluster index k, that is, longer segments receive smaller penalties (Descending), which encourages potentially deeper reasoning within each segment while discouraging the overproduction of short seg- ments. As a contrastive setting, we reverse the or- der to", "mechanism across segment clus- ters. By default, the penalty weight decreases with the cluster index k, that is, longer segments receive smaller penalties (Descending), which encourages potentially deeper reasoning within each segment while discouraging the overproduction of short seg- ments. As a contrastive setting, we reverse the or- der to make the weights increase with k, defined as wk = (k\u22121)\u00d70.05+1 (Ascending). We train both configurations under REINFORCE on Qwen-2.5- 14B-it\u2217and track the evolution of accuracy (Acc), average token quantity of responses (Avg Len), and average segment length (Avg Seg Len), smoothed and visualized in Figure 4. The results reveal that test-time scaling emerges under both settings: as training progresses, the average token quantity grows alongside task per- formance. However, the Ascending configuration exhibits a much steeper rise in both metrics, reach- ing a peak earlier but soon suffering a sharp ac- curacy collapse, indicating training instability. In contrast, the Descending configuration shows stead- ier improvement, with accuracy increasing more smoothly over time. However, after reaching the peak length, the Ascending model fails to compress thinking content effectively. Considering its high weight on the short segment clusters, it resembles the degenerate feature observed in LCPO, where the model excessively expands reasoning without meaningful gains. The segment-level patterns in Figure 4 (c) fur- ther support this observation. At the beginning, RLVR generally drives models to produce shorter segments to activate length scaling, and both config- urations behave similarly. However, as training con- tinues, the Ascending weights push the model to rapidly over-optimize for shorter segments, which is a turning point that coincides with its accuracy collapse. Conversely, the Descending configuration gradually shifts toward generating longer segments, 6 Acc Avg Len -0.09% -0.09% -0.19% -53.93 -36.62 -191.61 Figure 5: Effect of GRSP across models of varying capacities, comparing changes in accuracy and average response length. i.e., increasing the proportion of long segments. Interestingly, this adjustment leads to an overall shorter average response length, suggesting that the model learns a more efficient reasoning strat- egy: thinking more thoroughly within each seg- ment, thus requiring fewer total steps to reach the correct answer. These findings also shed light on the dynam- ics between the verifiable reward and the length penalty. During the early stage, the verifiable re- ward dominates, and both configurations exhibit similar trends across all three metrics. In the mid- stage, both encounter a transition point where ac- curacy begins to drop a bit. In the near time, length decreases, indicating a shift in optimization focus from purely correctness to brevity, which in turn risks destabilizing training. The Descending con- figuration, however, escapes this collapse by in- creasing the proportion of long segments, allowing accuracy and efficiency to improve jointly. This confirms that accuracy and length optimization are not a zero-sum game; with a proper pattern, GRSP achieves a stable balance between concise reason- ing and task effectiveness. Hence, we conclude that descending weighting can be a more stable and interpretable optimization signal. 4.5 Scaling of Model Capacity Results on open-source LRMs from Table 2 sug- gest that the capacity of base models plays", "proper pattern, GRSP achieves a stable balance between concise reason- ing and task effectiveness. Hence, we conclude that descending weighting can be a more stable and interpretable optimization signal. 4.5 Scaling of Model Capacity Results on open-source LRMs from Table 2 sug- gest that the capacity of base models plays a critical role in task performance and token efficiency. For example, DeepSeek-R1, the largest model in our evaluation, achieves near the top accuracy and to- ken efficiency, while DS-Qwen-Distill-32B also re- quires fewer tokens than its 14B counterpart. This naturally raises the question of how model capacity interacts with GRSP during RL training. To investigate it, we conduct experiments on three models from the Qwen-2.5 family: 7B-it, 14B-it, and 32B-it. Each model is first warmed up with the same SFT dataset, followed by RL training under two settings: standard Reinforce and Reinforce + GRSP, with all other hyperparameters held constant. We still track accuracy and average response length to test how the effect of GRSP varies across model scales (Figure 5). Our results reveal two clear trends: (1) Larger models are inherently more efficient and accurate even in RL, where the accuracy improves steadily with model size, while token consumption decreases under the same training setup. (2) GRSP consistently improves efficiency across all scales, with minimal impact on accuracy. While accuracy remains nearly unchanged, the reduction in token usage can grow. In particular, the 32B model can complete tasks with significantly fewer tokens compared to smaller models, reflecting its greater capacity to leverage reasoning compression. 4.6 Confidence-based Segmentation In \u00a7 3.3, we introduce another segmentation strat- egy based on the model\u2019s confidence distribution. Unlike keyword matching, it does not rely on man- ually collected keywords yet achieves similarly strong performance. Transitions between reasoning segments often correspond to local minima in the model\u2019s log prob- abilities. However, low logprob values can also occur in other cases, such as generating digits or single characters. Hence, after identifying posi- tions where the smoothed logprob falls below a threshold \u03b3, we further filter them based on token length and whether they correspond to local min- ima. Figure 6 (a) illustrates an example where a local minimum coincides with the start of a new reasoning segment. We conduct experiments using the confidence- based segmentation under the Reinforce+GRSP framework on Qwen-2.5-14B\u2217, and compare it with the proposed keyword-based segmentation in terms of accuracy and response length. As shown in Fig- ure 6 (b, c), the two curves exhibit similar trends. Notably, the confidence-based segmentation shows a rise\u2013fall\u2013rise pattern in both accuracy and length, whereas the keyword-based segmentation displays a steady decline in length without recovery. These 7 (a) (b) (c) Acc Avg Len Log Prob Figure 6: (a) Illustration of the log-probability trend around a segmentation point; (b) Comparison of accuracy between keyword-based and confidence-based segmentation; (c) Comparison of average response length. patterns are consistent with our findings in \u00a7 4.4: the verifiable signal and the length penalty occa- sionally compete, leading to temporary degradation in one metric that later recovers, instead of collaps- ing entirely.

One line of such work is Monte Carlo Tree Search or tree-structured prompt- ing (Wu et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2023). However, it involves trivial human-crafted engineering that hinders scaling up. Another line is Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) (Team et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025a; Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025) which encourages explo- ration of long and complex reasoning paths via simple binary signals provided by verifiers. 5.2 Efficient Long Chain-of-Thought LLMs Despite the remarkable effectiveness of the long reasoning patterns, they suffers from substantial computational overhead, especially for challenging user inputs where the model tends to repeatedly deliberate, named overthinking. To mitigate such phenomena, recent work aims at shortening reason- ing trajectories to reduce computation, while pre- serving task performance, e.g., accuracy (Sui et al., 2025). Lightweight approaches include designing control prompt, such as indicating a token budget or specifying reasoning granularity (Han et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Aytes et al., 2025), or intervening in the decoding process (Liu et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025; Ding et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025; Taubenfeld et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). However, they do not essentially modify the model\u2019s reasoning patterns, which may limit their robustness and ultimate performance. A fundamental solution is to introduce supervi- sion on reasoning efficiency during fine-tuning (Xia et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Arora and Zanette, 2025; Aggarwal and Welleck, 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025), especially in RLVR set- tings where both positive and negative rewards can effectively guide model behavior. Nevertheless, ex- isting studies mostly impose penalties on tokens, while the correlation between token-level penalties and the final verifiable rewards remains weak, lead- ing to limited compression effectiveness or even degradation in accuracy. 6 Conclusion To mitigate the overthinking of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose Group Relative Seg- ment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method that regularizes reasoning in RLVR. By supervising at the granularity of reasoning segments and apply- ing length-aware weighting, GRSP effectively mit- igates performance degradation while still increas- ing efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that GRSP has the advantages in the above two aspects, while also improving training stability and scaling across model sizes. We hope our study could inspire future research on the granularity se- lection of supervision during the design", "degradation while still increas- ing efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that GRSP has the advantages in the above two aspects, while also improving training stability and scaling across model sizes. We hope our study could inspire future research on the granularity se- lection of supervision during the design of RLVR algorithms for LRMs. 8 Limitations We also experimented with warm-up data con- structed from other patterns, such as those derived from DeepSeek-R1. However, we found that such data tends to make the model generate overly long responses even before reinforcement learning be- gins. As a result, it becomes difficult to observe clear scaling effects on response length. To further validate the compression of token us- age, it would be ideal to continue training from our current checkpoint using reinforcement learn- ing. Nevertheless, this requires substantial com- putational resources beyond our current budget. Despite these limitations, our experiments demon- strate the robustness of the proposed method and its potential for continued efficient scaling. We hope future work will further explore these directions. References Pranjal Aggarwal and Sean Welleck. 2025.

The learning rate is set to 2e-6. We randomly sample 1024 problems for each rollout iteration, and for each problem, we conduct 10 rollouts per iteration with temperature as 1.0, while temperature for evaluation is 0.6. Dynamic sampling (Yu et al., 2025) is applied, so the actual batch size varies across iterations. For GRSP, the descending weights for each length cluster wk are determined by wk = (K \u2212k) \u00d7 0.05 + 1, where the maximum cluster index K is 5. The balancing coefficient \u03b1 is set to 5e-3 for keyword-based segmentation and 2.5e-3 for confidence-based segmentation. We report the results with the highest task performance. C GRPO Ablation on the Weighting Mechanism Figure 7 presents the ablation results of the weighting mechanism on GRPO. A similar trend to Reinforce in Figure 4 can be observed, where the Ascending weighting improves accuracy more rapidly while the Descending weighting achieves stronger compression and maintains high accuracy. In addition, we find that GRPO training is generally more stable than Reinforce across all methods, so the Ascending setting does not collapse in the middle stage and excessively encourages short segments as in Reinforce training. Nevertheless, the Descending weighting still produces longer reasoning segments as expected.

Hedderich1,2 1Center for Information and Language Processing, LMU Munich 2Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) {yihong, rzhao, hedderich}@cis.lmu.de Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are increas- ingly deployed in multilingual, real-world ap- plications with user inputs \u2013 naturally intro- ducing typographical errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the ro- bustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MULTYPO, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard lay- outs and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open- source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language infer- ence, multi-choice question answering, math- ematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in genera- tive tasks and those requiring reasoning \u2013 while the natural language inference task is compara- tively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brit- tleness under noise. We also observe language- dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more ro- bust than translation into English. Our find- ings underscore the need for noise-aware train- ing and multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly available.1 1 Introduction LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world ap- plications such as chatbots, translation tools, and search engines (Dam et al., 2024; Naveed et al., 2024; Raza et al., 2025), where users input text via keyboards in a wide range of languages. In such settings, typographical errors (typos) are a natural part of user input \u2013 arising from slips, fast typing, or unfamiliarity with keyboard layouts (Wengelin, 2007; Conijn et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2025).

Humans often make typos on language- specific keyboard layouts, and once such errors are in- troduced, models can fail across languages. In this example, the model cannot generate the correct answer (\"500\") under typos in English, German, and Russian. this, most LLM evaluations assume clean, error- free input and report only a single aggregate statis- tic on a held-out set, thereby overlooking this ubiq- uitous source of noise (Sun et al., 2020;", "this example, the model cannot generate the correct answer (\"500\") under typos in English, German, and Russian. this, most LLM evaluations assume clean, error- free input and report only a single aggregate statis- tic on a held-out set, thereby overlooking this ubiq- uitous source of noise (Sun et al., 2020; Moradi and Samwald, 2021; Wang et al., 2024) and often over- estimating real-world performance (Ribeiro et al., 2020; Hedderich et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024) Robustness to typos is not just a usability concern; it is essential for ensuring reliable model behavior, maintaining user trust, and delivering consistent downstream performance in practical deployments. Prior work on robustness evaluation has largely focused on adversarial or synthetic perturbations in an English-centric manner (Gao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023; Gan et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). As a result, we know little about how robust LLMs are against realistic typos in a multilingual context. Models can generate wrong answers with simple input textual perturba- tions across languages, as shown in Figure 1.

Table 1: Examples of four different typographical errors. heuristics or character-level noise, with little regard for typing behavior (e.g., 10-finger typing conven- tion) based on language-specific keyboard layouts. To address these gaps, we first introduce MUL- TYPO, a multilingual typo generation algorithm grounded in empirical modeling of typing behavior. Unlike prior work, MULTYPO simulates realistic typos based on actual language-specific keyboard layouts and constraints, allowing us to generate noise that better reflects real-world user patterns across languages. Crucially, we validate typo real- ism through human evaluation, ensuring our per- turbations reflect actual typing behavior. Relying on MULTYPO, we conduct a comprehensive ro- bustness evaluation of 18 open-source LLMs, span- ning three major model families: Gemma, Qwen, and OLMo, using both base models and their instruction-tuned versions, across diverse down- stream tasks. Moreover, we assess the model ro- bustness under varying levels of typo corruption, and under both zero- and few-shot prompting. Our experiments yield several key findings. First, typographical errors consistently degrade model performance, particularly on generative tasks and those requiring reasoning (\u00a75.1). Second, model size does not guarantee robustness: both small and large models exhibit noticeable performance drops under typos (\u00a75.2). Third, instruction tuning im- proves clean-input performance but may also in- crease vulnerability under noise (\u00a75.3). Fourth, increasing the number of examples in few-shot set- tings does not improve the robustness against ty- pos (\u00a76.1). Lastly, robustness varies substantially across languages and scripts: for instance, trans- lation from English tends to be more robust than translation into English (\u00a76.2). Our contributions are summarized as follows. (i) We propose MULTYPO, a multilingual typo gener- ation algorithm that simulates realistic human-like errors grounded in language-specific keyboard lay- outs and typing patterns, and validate its realism through human evaluation.

(iv) We will release our code to facilitate further research on multilingual robustness under typographical errors. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Typographical Errors Typographical errors are among the most common forms of natural noise in user-generated text, typi- cally resulting from accidental keystrokes during typing. Early studies (Gardner, 1992; Lisbach and Meyer, 2013) have identified four core types of ty- pos: replacement, insertion, deletion, and trans- position. Replacement errors occur when the in- tended key is substituted with another, typically an adjacent key. Insertion errors arise from unin- tentionally pressing an adjacent key alongside the intended one, while deletion errors involve acci- dentally omitting a character. Transposition errors, frequently attributed to asynchronous hand move- ments, swap two adjacent characters, particularly those typed by different hands. Examples are illus- trated in Table 1. These four categories have been widely adopted and extended in subsequent work on noise modeling and robustness evaluation (Gao et al., 2018; Pruthi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Gan et al., 2024). They also form the foundation of our multilingual typo simulation algorithm MUL- TYPO (cf. \u00a73),2 which extends this line of work by incorporating language-specific keyboard layouts. 2.2 Related Work Input Text Perturbations Recent advances in LLMs have sparked growing interest in evaluat- ing their robustness to noisy or manipulated input. A large body of work focuses on input corrup- tions, which aim to degrade model performance by perturbing the input text at various granularities. These include character-level modifications such as misspellings and typographical errors (Gao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Pruthi et al., 2019; Gan et al., 2024), word-level attacks like synonym substitu- tion or word shuffling (Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Moradi and Samwald, 2021; 2For comparison, we implement a naive baseline that ap- plies the same operations without layout constraints, in line with prior approaches. We show that our typos better resem- ble human errors (cf. \u00a73.2) and that models exhibit different robustness to our typos versus the naive ones (cf. \u00a7D).

Zhou et al., 2024), and sentence-level perturbations through paraphrasing or irrelevant context inser- tions (Shi et al., 2023a; Lanham et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). Even minor punctuation noise can affect LLMs\u2019 performance (Abedin et al., 2025). However, most of this research is conducted in English-centric settings, leaving it unclear how ty- pos influence LLMs\u2019 robustness across different languages \u2013 a gap our work directly addresses. Multilingual Robustness Evaluation Another line of work has examined the robustness of multilingual models (Cooper Stickland et al., 2023; Aliakbarzadeh et al., 2025). For example, Cooper Stickland et al. (2023) investigated how real-world noise influences encoder-only models such as XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and proposed data augmen- tation with a contrastive loss for pretraining more robust multilingual models. More recently, Aliak- barzadeh et al. (2025) extended this line of inves- tigation to larger multilingual models, demonstrat- ing that performance deteriorates when inputs are corrupted by real-world noise in language under- standing tasks. In contrast to them, we explore typographical errors directly by introducing a mul- tilingual, keyboard-aware typo generation algo- rithm that enables realistic and extensible simu- lation across diverse languages. Additionally, our systematic evaluation covers a broader range of tasks beyond language understanding. 3 MULTYPO This section introduces MULTYPO, a multilingual typo generation algorithm designed to simulate realistic, human-like typos based on language- specific keyboard layouts. Given a clean input text, MULTYPO injects character-level perturba- tions that mimic natural typing mistakes, producing corrupted outputs that maintain the overall coher- ence of the original text. We describe the algorith- mic design in \u00a73.1, followed by a human evaluation in \u00a73.2 that evaluates how well the generated typos reflect real human typing behavior. 3.1 Algorithm Design To reflect the real typing behavior of users of dif- ferent languages, we leverage a keyboard layout database.3 When inserting typos, special symbols (e.g., punctuation marks or modifier keys such as Enter) are excluded. For determining which hand types a specific key, we rely on the standard 10- finger typing convention for QWERTY English keyboards, according to which characters such as \u201c5TGB\u201d are assigned to the left hand and \u201c6YHN\u201d to the right hand (Logan et al., 2016). For other lan- guages, we adopt the same keyboard-relative hand separation (i.e., left vs. right half, based on key positions) \u2013 a common implicit assumption in mul- tilingual", "to which characters such as \u201c5TGB\u201d are assigned to the left hand and \u201c6YHN\u201d to the right hand (Logan et al., 2016). For other lan- guages, we adopt the same keyboard-relative hand separation (i.e., left vs. right half, based on key positions) \u2013 a common implicit assumption in mul- tilingual layout design \u2013 though we validate its ap- propriateness empirically in our human evaluation. The overall pipeline of MULTYPO is illustrated in Figure 2. Below, we describe the key components in detail, and the description of MULTYPO. Typo Types We consider four types of typos based on existing literature, as introduced in \u00a72.1: replacement, insertion, deletion, and transposition. \u2022 Replacement: A single character in a word is replaced by a neighboring key based on the language-specific keyboard layout. 3https://kbdlayout.info/ \u2022 Insertion: A randomly selected additional character is inserted immediately after a cor- rectly typed character, simulating accidental simultaneous keystrokes. \u2022 Deletion: A single character in a word is ran- domly deleted from the word, simulating the common case where a keypress is missed. \u2022 Transposition: Two adjacent characters are swapped. We constrain this to occur only be- tween characters typed with different hands, based on the 10-finger typing convention. Ignoring String Sets To avoid corrupting tokens that are critical for downstream understanding, es- pecially numbers, we define a language-specific set of strings to ignore during typo insertion.4 These sets include numerical expressions commonly used across languages \u2013 both in digit form (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and in word form (e.g., \u201cthree\u201d, \u201chundred\u201d, \u201cmil- lion\u201d) (see Figure 8 in \u00a7A). During typo generation, any word that matches or contains a string in the set is excluded from being inserted with typos. Length-Aware Sampling Probability Rather than treating all words equally, we assign each word a sampling probability proportional to the square root of its length: \u221a |w| P w \u221a |w| (normalized over all words in a given text), reflecting the ten- dency for longer words to attract more typos (Peter- son, 1986; Kukich, 1992). In addition, when select- ing a specific character position within a word to in- sert or modify, we also consider position-dependent weights. Following observations from Lisbach and Meyer (2013), which show that errors are more likely to occur toward the middle or end of a word, we assign a non-uniform probability distribution over character indices, with details provided in \u00a7A. Algorithm Description Given an input sequence S = {w1, w2, . . . , wn} of n words, our algorithm begins by computing the number of typos to in- sert, determined by a user-defined corruption ratio \u03c4 \u2208[0, 1] and the total number of words n, rounded to the nearest integer. Each word wi is assigned a sampling probability proportional to the square root of its character length p |w|, as described earlier, and candidates are sampled accordingly. For each 4While this makes the noise slightly less realistic, it ensures that benchmark results reflect robustness to typos rather than being skewed by altered numeric values in the prompt.

The spe- cific character position within the word is sampled based on a length-aware, position-dependent distri- bution that favors later positions. Once the position in a word is determined, the algorithm applies the selected typo operation to that position. After each successful typo insertion, the corresponding word\u2019s sampling weight is halved to encourage distribu- tional diversity. The algorithm proceeds iteratively until either the target number of typos is reached or a maximum retry threshold is exceeded. The pipeline of MULTYPO is illustrated in Figure 2. 3.2 Human Evaluation on Typo Naturalness To further assess the realism of MULTYPO- generated typos, we conduct a human evaluation comparing MULTYPO against a naive baseline that applies the same four operations (insertion, dele- tion, substitution, transposition) but without con- sidering keyboard layout constraints. For each lan- guage, we sample 30 sentences from Flores200 (NLLB Team et al., 2022), split into two equal halves: 15 sentences corrupted by MULTYPO and 15 by the naive baseline. Within each set, we bal- anced the number of sentences across 3 corruption levels (0.1, 0.4, and 0.7; five sentences per level), while ensuring that sentence length distributions remained comparable across the two conditions. At least 15 participants in each language were asked to judge whether the typos in each sentence appeared natural or unnatural. This binary judgment pro- vides a direct measure of how human-like the errors appear. We collected annotations across seven lan- guages: Arabic, German, Greek, English, French, Hindi, and Russian (details provided in \u00a7B). Table 2 summarizes the results across languages. In six of the seven cases, MULTYPO is judged sig- nificantly more natural than the random baseline in the paired t-test (at least p < 0.05).

We include it in our further experiments for complete- ness, though results might need to be interpreted with caution. Taken together, this human evaluation confirms that MULTYPO can generally generate ty- pos perceived as more human-like across languages than a naive baseline process that does not consider keyboard layout constraints. In \u00a7D, we also show that models exhibit different robustness to our ty- pos versus the naive ones: models are more robust to typos generated by MULTYPO, possibly due to the exposure of similar typos \u2013 real-world human typos \u2013 in the pretraining phase. 4 Experimental Setup This section outlines our evaluation setup, where we apply MULTYPO to inject human-like typos into diverse downstream tasks and assess the robustness of different LLMs to these perturbations. 4.1 Languages We consider 12 languages spanning 7 language families and written in 7 different scripts, with a fo- cus on alphabet-based writing systems where typos are primarily influenced by keyboard layout. The set of supported languages by MULTYPO includes Arabic (ara_Arab), Armenian (hye_Armn), Bengali (ben_Beng), English (eng_Latn), French (fra_Latn), Georgian (kat_Geor), German (deu_Latn), Greek (ell_Grek), He- brew (heb_Hebr), Hindi (hin_Deva), Russian (rus_Cyrl), and Tamil (tam_Taml). 4.2 Models We evaluate 18 decoder-only language models from 3 model families: Gemma (Gemma Team et al., 2025), Qwen (Yang et al., 2025), and OLMo (Team OLMo et al., 2025). Models from the first two families are pretrained on highly multilingual corpora, while OLMo is pretrained on English-centric data. For the Gemma fam- ily, we consider gemma-3-1b-pt, gemma-3-4b-pt, and gemma-3-12b-pt. For the Qwen family, we consider Qwen3-1.7B-Base, Qwen3-4B-Base, and Qwen3-8B-Base. Finally for the OLMo family, we consider OLMo-2-0425-1B, OLMo-2-1124-7B, and OLMo-2-1124-13B. For each model above, we also consider its corresponding instruction-tuned version, aiming to systematically investigate the robustness against multilingual typos of models across size, family, and training strategies. 4.3 Dataset To evaluate robustness under multilingual ty- pos, we use six datasets spanning four task types: natural language inference (XNLI (Con- neau et al., 2018)), multiple-choice questions an- swering (Belebele (Bandarkar et al., 2024) and MMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021)), mathematical reasoning (MGSM (Shi et al., 2023b), along with Arabic and Hindi adaptations of GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021; Gumma et al., 2024; Omartificial- Intelligence-Space, 2025)), and machine transla- tion (FLORES200 (NLLB Team et al., 2022)). These datasets are selected to cover diverse tasks and our target languages. Note that the typos are only injected into the dataset instances, but not into other components of the prompt, such as task instructions, to ensure that we are evaluating ro- bustness to input corruption rather than altering the task specification itself. Further details, including language coverage of each dataset and used prompt templates, are provided in \u00a7C. 5 Results and Discussion In this section, we present the results of injecting typos into different", "to ensure that we are evaluating ro- bustness to input corruption rather than altering the task specification itself.

A different color represents each model family, and two lines are plotted per family: performance on clean input (0%) and input with a 10% typo rate. Larger models generally perform better but also exhibit performance drops under noise. (we further analyze the effect of example-count on robustness in \u00a76.1). In the following parts, we aim to investigate three research questions: (1) Does performance degrade when typographical errors are introduced, and if so, how much? (\u00a75.1); (2) Do larger models present better robustness against typographical errors compared to smaller ones? (\u00a75.2); and (3) Does instruction-tuning improve the robustness of the models? (\u00a75.3). 5.1 Performance Drop under Typos Figure 3 presents the average performance of three model families \u2013 Gemma, Qwen, and OLMo \u2013 across five multilingual tasks, under varying levels of typographical corruption (0%, 10%, 40%, 70%). Results are aggregated over instruction-tuned mod- els and all supported languages within each task. Typos consistently degrade performance across all models. Across all families and tasks, even minor typographical noise largely impairs model performance. For example, Qwen achieves over 50 on Belebele in the clean setting, but drops to around 45 with just a 10% typo rate. As noise increases, performance declines continuously. This pattern holds across families and tasks, underscor- ing a general vulnerability to surface-level pertur- bations. These findings echo prior monolingual results (Moradi and Samwald, 2021; Wang et al., 2025), and extend them to a multilingual setting. Robustness varies substantially by task. Typo sensitivity is not uniform across tasks. For in- stance, XNLI exhibits good robustness: Qwen\u2019s performance remains nearly unchanged under 10% noise.

In con- trast, tasks involving generative reasoning (e.g., MGSM) are highly susceptible. Qwen\u2019s accuracy on MGSM plummets from around 40 (clean) to around 27 (70% noise), suggesting that token-level corruption disrupts multi-step reasoning more than classification-based understanding. These results support earlier, monolingual claims that noisy in- puts affect complex reasoning (Gan et al., 2024). Takeaway. While LLMs can often infer intended meaning from noisy input in simpler classification tasks (e.g., natural language inference), reasoning tasks amplify the fragility introduced by typos. 5.2 Model Size Impact on Robustness Figure 4 presents the average performance when fed with clean inputs and with a small typo rate (10%). We group the models in each model family into different scales (Small, Medium, and Large). Results are averaged across tasks and supported languages, focusing on instruction-tuned models. Larger models consistently outperform smaller ones, with mild gains in robustness.

To further analyze the effect of model scale on robustness, we compute the relative degradation under a 10% typo rate ( Perf10%\u2212Perf0% Perf0% ).

To further analyze the effect of model scale on robustness, we compute the relative degradation under a 10% typo rate ( Perf10%\u2212Perf0% Perf0% ). As reported in Table 3, larger models show smaller drops \u2013 particularly within the Gemma and OLMo families. E.g., Gemma\u2019s relative drop decreases from 9.9% (Small) to 3.7% (Large), suggesting that greater model capacity enables better robustness. Takeaways. Scaling the model improves task per- formance under typo noise, but larger models are not immune to noise as well. However, larger mod- els present improved robustness under typos. 5.3 Base vs. Instruction-Tuned Models Figure 5 presents the performance of pretrained based models and their instruction-tuned versions under varying levels of typographical corruption (0%, 10%, 40%, 70%). Results are averaged over all supported languages within each task. Instruction-tuned models outperform base models but remain brittle under typos. Instruction-tuning improves overall performance, aligning with prior work (Liu et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2024), which shows that instruction-tuning enhances task-specific multi-step reasoning. Despite clear performance benefits under clean input, instruction-tuned models remain vulnerable to typos. In many cases, the absolute degradation under 10% or 40% noise is as severe as or even worse than their base counterparts. For instance, on MGSM, Gemma\u2019s instruction-tuned models drop from around 48 to 33 under 40% corruption. Similar degradation is seen across other families and tasks. This suggests that while instruction-tuned models are better at following complex prompts, they remain equally brittle under surface-level input corruption. Takeaways. Instruction-tuning boosts perfor- mance but does not improve robustness. Current tuning methods prioritize clean prompts and may underprepare models for noisy real-world input. 6 Complementary Analysis 6.1 Does Example Counts Affect Robustness? Few-shot prompting is known to enhance model performance by providing clearer task formula- tions and patterns (Brown et al., 2020; Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2022). This naturally raises the question: Can increasing the number of examples also im- prove robustness against typos? To explore this, we vary the number of examples in the prompt \u2013 0, ara_Arab hye_Armn ben_Beng fra_Latn kat_Geor deu_Latn ell_Grek heb_Hebr hin_Deva rus_Cyrl tam_Taml 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 BLEU Score Gemma: Translation Robustness Direction / Typo Rate From English To English 10% 40% 70% Figure 7: Robustness of Gemma models on Flores200 under different levels of typographical noise.

Figure 6 presents the aggregated results. Across the multilingual models (Gemma and Qwen), increasing the number of examples in few- shot settings leads to consistent performance gains until 3 shots. However, the robustness gap, i.e., the performance drop from clean to noisy inputs, remains nearly unchanged regardless of shot count. For the OLMo family, adding more examples does not seem to help and occasionally harms perfor- mance, likely due to its limited multilingual cov- erage and confusion introduced by prompts in lan- guages that OLMo does not support well. These findings suggest that while demonstrations im- prove overall performance, they do not inher- ently enhance robustness against typos. 6.2 Which Language is More Sensitive? We hypothesize that model robustness to typos is not uniform across languages, particularly due to data availability. To investigate this, we analyze performance degradation across eight languages that are each supported by at least three datasets. Table 4 presents results aggregated over all tasks. Additionally, we analyze Flores200 separately to examine how translation direction interacts with typo robustness. Specifically, we compare the per- formance of Gemma models when translating from English vs. into English, as shown in Figure 7. Across all three model families, English consis- tently exhibits the highest robustness \u2013 its relative drop is among the lowest. Other languages that use the Latin script, such as German and French, also show relatively small degradations. In contrast, languages with underrepresented scripts, including Arabic, Hindi, and Bengali, tend to exhibit larger drops. Interestingly, even Russian, despite being high-resource, suffers from sharp degradation (e.g., 11.9% for Gemma). This suggests that models are more robust in languages with both high data availability and orthographic familiarity (e.g., Latin script). Furthermore, Figure 7 shows that translations from English are more robust than those into English, reinforcing the idea that ty- pos in lower-resourced or structurally differ- ent input languages more severely impair both crosslingual understanding and generation. 7 Conclusion We present a comprehensive study on the multi- lingual robustness of LLMs under simulated, re- alistic typographical errors. To this end, we intro- duce MULTYPO, a multilingual typo generation algorithm grounded in language-specific keyboard layouts and human typing behavior. Through ex- tensive evaluation of 18 models across five tasks and three model families, we find that even mod- est levels of noise can impair model performance \u2013 particularly in reasoning-heavy tasks. While larger models and instruction tuning improve per- formance on clean inputs, they do not necessar- ily confer greater robustness. Moreover, we iden- tify language-specific sensitivity: models are more resilient in high-resource, Latin-script languages. These findings highlight critical blind spots in cur- rent", "model performance \u2013 particularly in reasoning-heavy tasks. While larger models and instruction tuning improve per- formance on clean inputs, they do not necessar- ily confer greater robustness. Moreover, we iden- tify language-specific sensitivity: models are more resilient in high-resource, Latin-script languages. These findings highlight critical blind spots in cur- rent LLM evaluation and motivate future work on noise-aware multilingual pretraining, evaluation, and human-centric error modeling. Limitations While our work provides a first step toward mul- tilingual robustness evaluation under human-like typographical errors, we acknowledge that several limitations remain. First, MULTYPO currently supports a diverse but limited set of typologically diverse languages. To incorporate a new language, one needs to manu- ally specify the corresponding keyboard layout and typing conventions. Second, our algorithm does not yet support lo- gographic or syllabic writing systems, such as Chi- nese. This limitation stems from the fundamen- tal differences in input methods \u2013 e.g., Chinese characters are typically typed via phonetic systems like Pinyin rather than direct keypresses. Model- ing such input pipelines requires a fundamentally different corruption strategy. Future work could ex- tend MULTYPO to accommodate these languages by simulating common typing errors in the inter- mediate input stages (e.g., Pinyin mistyping or can- didate misselection). Third, our human evaluation provides important validation of the realism of MULTYPO, covering multiple languages. However, results for Arabic did not show significant improvements over the naive baseline, suggesting that our typo simulation algorithm MULTYPO may not capture all language- specific properties equally well. However, this does not overshadow the findings that LLMs are not robust to multilingual textual perturbations. Finally, we focus exclusively on physical key- boards (e.g., QWERTY), while ignoring other in- put modalities such as touchscreen keyboards on mobile devices. Typing behaviors, error distribu- tions, and auto-correct interference vary substan- tially across modalities (Jokinen et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2025). Evaluating robustness under such device-dependent noise would further enrich our understanding of LLM performance in real-world settings, which we leave for future work.

Ethical Considerations Data Annotation Before conducting the human evaluation, all participants were clearly informed about the purpose, procedure, and voluntary nature of the study, and provided their informed consent. For most languages, annotators were recruited via Prolific and compensated fairly at a rate equivalent to approximately \u00a36 per hour (about \u00a31 per com- pleted annotation set) (details are provided in \u00a7B). A small portion of participants (around 10%) were personal contacts who volunteered without com- pensation. No personally identifiable information was collected, and all demographic data (e.g., age, gender) was provided optionally.

A Additional Details of MULTYPO Neighbors of Keys In our work, we define a char- acter\u2019s neighbors (which are used in typo operation replace and insert) as the keys that are immediately adjacent to it on the same row of the keyboard \u2013 specifically, the key to its left and the key to its right, based on the empirical findings that horizon- tal neighbor errors are more common (MacNeilage, 1964).6 Keys corresponding to non-alphabetic sym- bols or function keys (such as Enter or Tab) are not considered, and characters that are absent from the specified keyboard layout simply have no neigh- bors. This definition provides a consistent notion of adjacency across languages and platforms, avoid- ing complications introduced by layout-specific variations in the placement of special characters (e.g., brackets on Windows vs.", "or Tab) are not considered, and characters that are absent from the specified keyboard layout simply have no neigh- bors. This definition provides a consistent notion of adjacency across languages and platforms, avoid- ing complications introduced by layout-specific variations in the placement of special characters (e.g., brackets on Windows vs. macOS). Ignoring String Sets As described in \u00a73.1, we exclude several words from being selected as the candidates to insert typos. These words are mainly commonly used numerical expressions across lan- guages. We exclude them since they are typically 6To reflect the real typing behavior of users of differ- ent languages, we leverage a keyboard layout database from https://kbdlayout.info/, which uses data

in MULTYPO. critical for downstream understanding. The set for each language is visualized in Figure 8. Sampling In MULTYPO, there are three places where we introduce randomness by sampling: word sampling, position sampling, and typo operation sampling. We introduce the details of each sam- pling process in the following. \u2022 Word Sampling: We assign each word a sam- pling probability proportional to the square root of its length: p |w|. We then normalize the probability by dividing the sum over all words: P w p |w|. This probability reflects the empirically observed tendency for longer words to attract more typos. \u2022 Position Sampling: When selecting a spe- cific character position within a word to insert or modify a character, we consider position- dependent weights: the first character is as- signed a weight of 0 and is never selected; the second character receives a weight of 0.1; the final character receives 0.2; and all intermedi- ate positions are linearly interpolated between these values. This empirical setup is based on findings from Lisbach and Meyer (2013) that word-initial errors are rare. The probability of each position is then its normalized weight. \u2022 Typo Operation Sampling: Insertion op- erations are sampled with a probability of 15.25%, while replacement, deletion, and transposition are each assigned a probability of 28.25%. This skewed distribution reflects empirical observations that insertion errors are less common than the other three error types according to the findings from Baba and Suzuki (2012). Validating Operation In our implementation, in- stead of sampling all candidate words at once, we iteratively select a word at a time and insert", "skewed distribution reflects empirical observations that insertion errors are less common than the other three error types according to the findings from Baba and Suzuki (2012). Validating Operation In our implementation, in- stead of sampling all candidate words at once, we iteratively select a word at a time and insert a typo into it, guaranteeing an adequate number of ty- pos according to the user specification (typo rate). Therefore, when inserting a typo into a word, we perform a validity check before applying each op- eration. Because errors are introduced iteratively, unconstrained edits could yield implausible out- comes \u2013 for example, replacing the initial w in word with e to obtain eord, and then replacing e back with w, which would be counted as two errors despite leaving the word unchanged. The validity check prevents such contradictions and filters out unlikely multi-step substitutions, ensuring that the final set of typos is consistent with natural typing patterns. Special Cases and Strategies We handle several edge cases to keep the typographical errors mean- ingful and realistic: \u2022 If the selected word is only one character long, or if it contains an item of the prede- fined Ignoring String Sets, another word will be selected. \u2022 If the transpose operation is selected and the word is not the final word in the sentence, a whitespace character is appended to the end of the word. This is done to facilitate the de- tection of cross-hand key pairs, as previously described, unless the whitespace has already been appended in an earlier iteration. \u2022 If the typo operation is deemed invalid or if the modified word is identical to the original (indicating no actual change occurred), an- other typo function is selected for the same word. B Details of Human Evaluation Overview We designed a lightweight web inter- face to collect judgments of typo naturalness. Par- ticipants first selected their evaluation language (English, German, French, Greek, Russian, Ara- bic, Hindi), filled in basic demographic informa- tion (age, gender, nationality, fluency in the se- lected language),7 , as shown in Figure 9 and then completed 30 annotation trials. Each trial displayed a single corrupted sentence from Flores200 (NLLB Team et al., 2022), and participants judged whether the typos appeared natural or unnatural, as shown in Figure 10. At the end of the evaluation, the par- ticipant needed to provide a confidence rating (1\u20135) (the higher, the more confident). Task Setup. In total, 30 sentences were sampled from Flores200, with 15 corrupted by MULTYPO and 15 by the random baseline (5 sentences at 10%, 40%, and 70% typo rates for each system). Sen- tences were balanced for length across the two con- ditions. The order of the sentences is randomized for each participant to avoid a systematic learning effect while going through the sentences. Partici- pants completed the annotation in \u223c5-8 minutes. Participants were recruited through personal con- tacts (\u223c10%, mainly for English and German), ex- tended through recruitment on Prolific.8 We com- pensated crowdworkers at a rate equivalent to about \u00a36 per hour, which corresponds to roughly \u00a31 per", "going through the sentences.

We did not store any personally identifiable information except for fluency (for ensuring the quality). 8https://www.prolific.com/ Figure 9: Screenshot of the annotation interface. Figure 10: Example of annotating one sentence. Participants. We collected at least 15 valid re- sponses per language.9 Table 5 summarizes the fluency levels and self-reported confidence across languages. Table 6 and Table 7 summarize the dis- tribution of age and gender, respectively. Overall, the pool covered a balanced mix of native, near- native, and non-native speakers, with most partici- pants being native or near-native and reporting high confidence (4\u20135). Findings. Extending on the results reported in \u00a73.2, we also observe a clear effect of corruption level (cf. Figure 11): across all languages, higher typo rates lead to substantially lower \u201cnaturalness\u201d judgments, aligning with the intuition that dense er- ror patterns are less plausible as real-world human mistakes. Importantly, we observe that even under severe corruption (i.e., 40% and 70%), MULTYPO maintains a naturalness advantage over the naive baseline, highlighting that modeling human-typing behavior provides a better simulation of real-world typos. 9For each language, we enabled Prolific\u2019s auto-filtering fea- ture, which excluded responses completed in under 3 minutes as likely invalid. 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for Arabic Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for German Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for Greek Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for English Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for French Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for Hindi Multypo Naive 10% 40% 70% Typo Rate 0 20 40 60 80 100 % judged as Natural Human Judgments for Russian Multypo Naive Figure 11: Human evaluation results grouped by the three considered typo rates (10%, 40%, 70%) across seven languages.

Each downstream task covers a slightly different set of languages, and therefore, we only evaluate on languages that are supported by MULTYPO for each dataset. Table 8 presents the languages supported in each dataset. Instance Selection To ensure a fair and balanced evaluation, we cap each dataset at a maximum of 1,000 instances across languages where possible. Belebele contains roughly 900 instances by design and requires no further reduction. For Flores200, we selected 500 instances per translating direction (translating into and from English), yielding 1,000 prompts in total. MGSM and its Arabic and Hindi adaptations are limited to 250 examples each to maintain consistency. For XNLI and MMMLU, we subsample 1,000 instances while preserving original label (XNLI) and subject-area (MMMLU) distributions. The sampling is consistently applied in each parallel dataset to ensure comparability across languages. C.2 Prompt Templates For each dataset, prompts are constructed in a stan- dardized format to ensure consistency across exper- iments. If typographical errors are injected, only the instances of the dataset, denoted in curly brack- ets {} ({language} in Flores200 is an exception), are affected.

Each cell shows the p-value with significance stars (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). Few-Shot Setup For each shot setting, we sam- ple a fixed set of support examples per language and introduce typographical noise according to the specified corruption level. To preserve a consistent supervision signal, the correct answers in the exem- plars are left unaltered, allowing the model to learn correct associations even under noisy contexts. The same exemplars are used across all evaluations to ensure comparability. Whenever possible, exam- ples are drawn from the training or development splits; otherwise, the first instances from the test split are selected. The remaining data points serve as independent queries during evaluation. D Performance Comparison with Random Typo Baseline We examine performance differences when input text is perturbed by MULTYPO \u2013 which simulates human typing behavior \u2013 versus a random typo baseline that applies the same four operations de- scribed in \u00a73.1 but disregards keyboard layout con- straints. For this evaluation, we use Qwen3-4B (instruction-tuned) across all five tasks. As shown in Figure 12, performance under ran- dom perturbations is consistently lower than with MULTYPO. This suggests that models are more ro- bust to MULTYPO typos, likely because they better approximate realistic human typing errors, some of which may already be represented in pretrain- ing corpora. Table 9 further confirms these trends: (1) For natural language understanding tasks (e.g., XNLI), the performance gap is small and not sta- tistically significant. (2) For generation tasks \u2013 par- ticularly those requiring reasoning \u2013 the random baseline leads to significantly larger degradation compared to MULTYPO. E Complementary Results on Translation We also compare the performance of Qwen and OLMo models when translating from English vs. into English, as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. In general, we observe the same trend as in Fig- ure 7. That is, translations from English are more robust than those into English. This trend is typi- cally noticeable when involving low-resource lan- guages that are written in non-Latin scripts, such as hye_Armn and kat_Geor.

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

All methods are evaluated with a generation length of 256 in 128 denoising steps. Full results are provided in Table 1. 1 Introduction Diffusion models, originally pioneered for high-fidelity image generation (Song et al., 2020; Ho et al., 2020), have recently emerged as a powerful and efficient paradigm for text generation (Austin et al., 2021; Campbell et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Lou et al., 2023; Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). These models operate in a discrete space but share architectural similarities with their continuous counterparts (Peebles and Xie, 2023). They employ a fixed noising process that progressively corrupts text data, while a neural network is trained to learn the reverse, denoising process. For instance, Masked Diffusion Language Model (MDLM) (Sahoo et al., 2024) uses random masking as its forward noising process and optimizes an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood. This ELBO-based objective has been widely adopted by subsequent large-scale diffusion language models (dLLMs), including LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) and DREAM (Gong et al., 2024). A key advantage of dLLMs over their autoregressive (AR) counterparts is their ability to decode multiple tokens in parallel. This parallelism can significantly reduce inference latency, making it an attractive alternative for scalable language modeling (Wang et al., 2025a; Labs et al., 2025). 1 arXiv:2510.09541v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Figure 2 The training process of SPG for MDLM.

Left: From a prompt c, we generate responses {xj}g j=1. We then maximize a lower bound on the likelihood \u03c0\u03b8(xj | c) for high-reward responses while minimizing an upper bound for low-reward ones. Right: The upper/lower bound of likelihood is estimated via Monte Carlo using a block-wise masking strategy, where a random block is selected for masking, with earlier blocks kept clean and later blocks fully masked. The example shows a sequence of length 9 with a block size of 3, where the current generation block is highlighted in yellow. Aligning large language models with human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022) or task-specific rewards (e.g., inducing reasoning behavior) (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025) typically requires a post-training stage of reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL to dLLMs remains underexplored. A principal challenge is the computationally intractable log-likelihood of dLLMs, which is essential for accurate policy gradient estimation. To circumvent this, recent works (Zhao et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2025) adapt standard RL and preference optimization algorithms, such as GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), by using the ELBO or a one-step estimation as a surrogate for the true likelihood. While straightforward, this approximation leads to misaligned policy gradients, and potential suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion language models that computes a more robust and less biased policy gradient. As illustrated in Figure 2, our core idea is to \u201csandwich\u201d the intractable log-likelihood of a generated sequence: we maximize a tractable lower bound for positive-reward sequences while minimizing an upper bound for negative-reward ones. To ensure a stable estimation of these bounds, we also propose a block-wise masking strategy that better aligns data distributions during policy rollout and optimization. SPG achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by up to 3.6% on GSM8K, 2.6% on MATH500, 18.4% on Countdown, and 27.0% on Sudoku compared to the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for diffusion language models. In summary, our main contributions are: \u2022 A new policy gradient algorithm, SPG, which reduces bias by optimizing sandwiched variational bounds based on reward. \u2022 A block-wise masking technique that improves the stability of the training objective\u2019s estimation. \u2022 State-of-the-art results among RL algorithms for diffusion language models on four reasoning benchmarks, demon- strating the effectiveness of our approach. 2 Background In this section, we provide a brief overview of the masked diffusion language model (MDLM) and reinforcement learning for text diffusion models. Notation. We denote scalars by lowercase letters (x), vectors by bold lowercase (x), and sequences by x1:n. [k] represents {1, . . . , k}. Cat(x | p) is the categorical distribution over x with probabilities p, and U[a, b] denotes the uniform distribution in [a, b]. Throughout the paper, we use i", "scalars by lowercase letters (x), vectors by bold lowercase (x), and sequences by x1:n. [k] represents {1, . . . , k}. Cat(x | p) is the categorical distribution over x with probabilities p, and U[a, b] denotes the uniform distribution in [a, b]. Throughout the paper, we use i \u2208[n] for position of the token, j \u2208[g] for a sequence in a group of rollouts, and t for the diffusion timestep. For discrete time processes, t \u2208[T], while for continuous-time Markov chains, t \u2208[0, 1]. 2 2.1 Masked Diffusion Language Models Diffusion models for language learn to generate text by reversing a gradual noising process. Specifically, Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) (Sahoo et al., 2024) start with clean text x1:n and corrupt it into zt \u2261zt,1:n over a continuous timestep t \u2208[0, 1] by progressively replacing tokens with a special [mask] token. At t = 0, the data is original (z0 = x), while at t = 1, the sequence is fully masked (z1 is all [mask] tokens). Each token is corrupted independently according to the forward transition kernel: qt|0(zt,i | xi) = Cat \u0000zt,i | \u03b1txi + (1 \u2212\u03b1t)m \u0001 , (1) where m is the one-hot representation of the [mask] token. The noise schedule, \u03b1t \u2208[0, 1], is a strictly decreasing function, such as the linear schedule \u03b1t = 1 \u2212t, with \u03b10 = 1 and \u03b11 = 0. In the reverse process, a neural network, which we denote as the policy \u03c0\u03b8, is then trained to perform the reverse process: predicting the original tokens x from a corrupted version zt. The transition from zt to zs (s < t) is parameterized with \u03c0\u03b8 as follows: p\u03b8(zs | zt) = q (zs | zt, x = \u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | zt)) = ( Cat(zs; zt), zt \u0338= m, Cat \u0010 zs; (1\u2212\u03b1s)m+(\u03b1s\u2212\u03b1t)\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|zt) 1\u2212\u03b1t \u0011 , zt = m. The policy is achieved by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood of each clean sequence x \u223cpdata, which simplifies to the following objective: LELBO(x; \u03b8) = Et,zt \u0014 n X i=1 w(t) \u00b7 1(zt,i = m) \u00b7 log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt) \u0015 , (2) where w(t) = \u03b1\u2032 t/(\u03b1t \u22121) is a time-dependent loss weight, and the expectation is over a random timestep t \u223cU[0, 1] and the corrupted sequence zt \u223cqt|0(\u00b7 | x). In essence, this objective trains the model to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d by predicting the original tokens at masked positions. For a more comprehensive overview of MDLM, please refer to Section A and Sahoo et al. (2024). 2.2 Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Language Models Reinforcement Learning (RL) aligns a language model with desired objectives by treating it as a policy \u03c0\u03b8 that generates a response x to a prompt c. A reward function R(c, x) provides a scalar score for the response, and the training goal is to update \u03b8 to maximize the expected reward: J (\u03b8) := Ex\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|c)[R(c, x)]. This objective is commonly optimized using policy gradient methods, which rely on the following gradient estimator. \u2207\u03b8J (\u03b8) = Ex\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|c) \u0014 R(c, x)\u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(x |", "a scalar score for the response, and the training goal is to update \u03b8 to maximize the expected reward: J (\u03b8) := Ex\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|c)[R(c, x)]. This objective is commonly optimized using policy gradient methods, which rely on the following gradient estimator. \u2207\u03b8J (\u03b8) = Ex\u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|c) \u0014 R(c, x)\u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(x | c) \u0015 . (3) The Intractability Challenge. A central challenge in applying RL to diffusion models is that the policy\u2019s log-likelihood, log \u03c0\u03b8(x | c), is intractable and cannot be computed directly. To overcome this, prior work (Zhu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) approximates this term using its ELBO, effectively replacing log \u03c0\u03b8(x | c) with a score derived from the pre-training objective in Equation (2). However, this popular workaround introduces a critical flaw. The ELBO is only a lower bound on the true log-likelihood (ELBO \u2264log \u03c0\u03b8). Consequently, the RL objective is only a valid lower bound on the true expected reward if all rewards R(c, x) are non-negative. This constraint prevents the model from effectively learning from negative feedback (i.e., penalizing bad outputs) and is incompatible with advanced RL algorithms that use relative or negative rewards (Shao et al., 2024), biasing the final policy. Our work aims to resolve this limitation. 3 Sandwiched Policy Gradient with Evidence Bounds We introduce SPG, a novel policy gradient algorithm designed for masked diffusion language models (Algorithm 1). Our method aims to address a critical issue in applying reinforcement learning to dLLMs by creating a valid optimization objective based on tractable bounds of the model\u2019s evidence. 3 Algorithm 1 SPG: Sandwiched Policy Gradient for Masked dLLMs Require: prompt distribution D, number of completions per prompt g, number of inner updates \u00b5, forward process q, number of Monte Carlo samples m, initial policy \u03c00, learning rate \u03f5. 1: Initialize \u03c0\u03b8 \u2190\u03c00 2: while not converged do 3: Sample a prompt c \u223cD, then g completions {xj \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | c)}g j=1 4: \u2200j \u2208[g], compute reward R(c, xj) and advantage Aj(xj, c) 5: for gradient update iterations {1, . . . , \u00b5} do 6: \u2200j \u2208[g], generate m perturbed samples {zj t\u03c4 }m \u03c4=1 \u223cq(\u00b7 | xj) via block-wise masking (Section 3.3). 7: Compute the sandwiched policy gradient \u2207JSPG(\u03b8) where: JSPG(\u03b8) = E \u00141 g g X j=1 \u0010 1Aj\u22650 \u00b7 AjLELBO(xj | c; \u03b8) + 1Aj<0 \u00b7 Aj \u02dcLEUBO(xj | c; \u03b8) \u0011 \u0015 , 8: and LELBO, \u02dcLEUBO are estimated from {zj t\u03c4 }m \u03c4=1, using Equation 2 and 7. 9: Perform gradient update: \u03b8 \u2190\u03b8 + \u03f5\u2207JSPG(\u03b8) 10: return \u03c0\u03b8 3.1 A Lower Bound Objective for Policy Optimization Our approach is based on group relative policy optimization (Shao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b). For a given prompt c, we generate a group of g responses {xj}g j=1 from the policy \u03c0\u03b8. We then compute the advantage Aj(c, xj) := R(c, xj) \u22121 g Pg \u0237=1 R(c, x\u0237). Moreover, we transform the conventional policy optimization objective as an advantage-weighted log-likelihood objective, for reasons that will be clear later: J group(\u03b8) = Ec,{xj}\u223c\u03c0sg[\u03b8] \u0014 1 g g X j=1 Aj(xj,", "the policy \u03c0\u03b8. We then compute the advantage Aj(c, xj) := R(c, xj) \u22121 g Pg \u0237=1 R(c, x\u0237). Moreover, we transform the conventional policy optimization objective as an advantage-weighted log-likelihood objective, for reasons that will be clear later: J group(\u03b8) = Ec,{xj}\u223c\u03c0sg[\u03b8] \u0014 1 g g X j=1 Aj(xj, c) log \u03c0\u03b8(xj | c) \u0015 , (4) where sg[\u03b8] indicates that gradients are not computed for the policy that generates the samples. This objective encourages generations with positive advantages (Aj > 0) and discourages those with negative advantages (Aj < 0). For dLLMs, the log-likelihood log \u03c0\u03b8 is intractable. A common surrogate is the evidence lower bound (ELBO). While maximizing the ELBO is a valid way to increase the true log-likelihood, minimizing the ELBO for negatively-rewarded samples does not guarantee a reduction in the true log-likelihood. To address this, we propose a sandwiched objective. For samples with positive advantages, we maximize the ELBO. For samples with negative advantages, we instead minimize a tractable evidence upper bound (EUBO), LEUBO. This creates a true lower bound for the original objective: JSPG(\u03b8) = E \u0014 1 g g X j=1 \u00001Aj\u22650 \u00b7 AjLELBO(xj | c; \u03b8) + 1Aj<0 \u00b7 AjLEUBO(xj | c; \u03b8) \u0001 \u0015 , (5) where the expectation is take with respect to c, {xj} \u223c\u03c0sg[\u03b8]. Since LELBO \u2264log \u03c0\u03b8 \u2264LEUBO, it follows that JSPG(\u03b8) \u2264J group(\u03b8). Maximizing this tractable bound therefore serves as a valid proxy for optimizing the true objective. 3.2 A Tractable Evidence Upper Bound To effectively penalize negatively-rewarded samples by minimizing their log-likelihood, we require a tractable EUBO, which we derive in the following theorem based on the R\u00e9nyi variational bound. Theorem 1 (Evidence Upper Bound for Masked Diffusion). Assume the forward denoising process has T steps with a monotonic schedule \u03b1t. For any \u03b2 \u22651 and a sequence x1:n, we have: LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1 \" \u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u00b7 1(zt+1,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt+1) # + C(T), (6) 4 where C(T) := 1(\u03b2 < n) \u00b7 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) h q(z1:T | x)\u2212ni is a constant independent of \u03b8. Here, \u03b2 \u22651 is a hyperparameter that controls the tightness of the bound, with values closer to 1 yielding a tighter bound. The expectation is taken over the timestep t \u223cU[0, 1] and the noised latent zt \u223cqt|0(\u00b7 | x). Corollary 1. Taking the limit of T \u2192\u221e, we have: \u2207\u03b8LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = \u2207\u03b8 \u0010 \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) + C(T) \u0011 = \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8), where \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log Et,zt h w(t) \u00b7 1(zt,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt) i . (7) In practice, we estimate \u02dcLEUBO using Monte Carlo sampling and plug it in Equation 5 in place of LEUBO. The proof and theoretical analysis are provided in Appendix B. Remark. A key structural difference from LELBO is that the logarithm in LEUBO (Equation (6)) appears outside the expectation. Therefore, in practice, due to Jensen\u2019s inequality, applying the concave logarithm to a Monte", "in Equation 5 in place of LEUBO. The proof and theoretical analysis are provided in Appendix B. Remark. A key structural difference from LELBO is that the logarithm in LEUBO (Equation (6)) appears outside the expectation. Therefore, in practice, due to Jensen\u2019s inequality, applying the concave logarithm to a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation\u2019s argument yields a biased estimate of the true EUBO. While it is possible to derive a looser but unbiased bound using inequalities like log(x) \u2264x \u22121, we found this approach empirically worse by widening the gap to the true log-likelihood, as shown in Table 10. We therefore retain the tighter, albeit slightly biased, formulation. 3.3 Practical Considerations Block-Wise Masking Strategy for Monte Carlo Estimation. In practice, we approximate LELBO and \u02dcLEUBO in Equation (5) via Monte Carlo sampling: for each xj, we randomly sample m timesteps {t\u03c4}m \u03c4=1 and generate the corresponding partially masked samples {zj t\u03c4 }m \u03c4=1 \u223cq(\u00b7 | xj). One straightforward approach as used in Yang et al. (2025) would be to apply random masking to clean sequences. However, recent dLLMs like LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) employ a block-wise semi-autoregressive unmasking strategy during generation and achieve state-of-the-art performance over random unmasking. As a result, the policy rollout process actually encounters a much narrower and more structured set of partially masked sequences than with fully random masking. To better align data distributions during policy rollout and optimization, we adopt a block-wise masking strategy rather than random masking. As depicted in Figure 2, the sequence is divided into several blocks, and a random block is selected, with all preceding blocks left clean and all following blocks fully masked. Within the chosen block, tokens are randomly masked. Additionally, following D1 (Zhao et al., 2025), we lightly perturb the prompt and clean blocks by randomly masking tokens with a small probability pmask = 0.15 to enhance stability and generalization. Altogether, our block-wise masking strategy improves the stability of the objective\u2019s estimation and the efficiency of policy optimization. While similar block-wise masking approaches have been explored in concurrent work for supervised fine-tuning or block diffusion models (Sun et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b), our focus is on RL for full-attention masked dLLMs. As shown in Figure 6, our models trained with block-wise masking generalize well to various inference strategies. Mixture of Upper and Lower Bound for Negative Advantage Traces. Monte Carlo estimation of Equation (6) leads to a biased estimation to \u02dcLEUBO and potentially requires a substantial number of samples to get reliable approximations, resulting in high computational costs and instability during training. To address these challenges, we use a mixture of \u02dcLEUBO and LELBO as a more practical log-likelihood approximation for negative advantage traces: \u02dcLMix(x | c; \u03b8) := \u03c9 \u00b7 \u02dcLEUBO(x | c; \u03b8) + (1 \u2212\u03c9) \u00b7 LELBO(x | c; \u03b8) (8) where 0 \u2264\u03c9 \u22641 is a blend coefficient. Intuitively, the upper bound \u02dcLEUBO sharpens the model decisions by applying a \u03b2-power adjustment to the original model output, acting as a strong correction signal for negative advantage traces. In contrast, the lower bound", "(1 \u2212\u03c9) \u00b7 LELBO(x | c; \u03b8) (8) where 0 \u2264\u03c9 \u22641 is a blend coefficient. Intuitively, the upper bound \u02dcLEUBO sharpens the model decisions by applying a \u03b2-power adjustment to the original model output, acting as a strong correction signal for negative advantage traces. In contrast, the lower bound LELBO is easier and more stable to estimate with a small number of Monte Carlo samples, but it tends to introduce larger, systematic bias relative to the true log-likelihood. In particular, as a conservative approximation, LELBO alone is insufficient for effectively penalizing negative advantage traces, thus limiting its efficacy. Therefore, combining them allows us to harness the strengths of each, resulting in a more effective log-likelihood estimation in 5 practice. In the following proposition, we formalize the advantages of using the mixture by deriving the gradient of the mixture loss and analyzing the variance of the gradient. Proposition 1 (Optimal Mixture Strictly Reduces Variance). Fix a coordinate k and let \u03c1\u03b2 := w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c)/E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) i , where w(t, zt) := w(t)1(zt = m). Then, the gradient of mixture objective (8) is given by g\u03c9,k = ((1 \u2212\u03c9)w(t, zt) + \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2) \u2202\u03b8k log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt, c). (9) If Var((\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w(t, zt))\u2202\u03b8k log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt, c)) > 0, then Var[g\u03c9,k] is a strictly convex quadratic in \u03c9 and thus admits a unique minimizer \u03c9\u22c6 k. Moreover, Var[g\u03c9\u22c6 k,k] < min \b Var[g0,k], Var[g1,k] , A proof for the above proposition is provided in Section C.1. A few remarks are in order: \u2022 Confidence-aware weighting: The mixture gradient in Equation (9) realizes a confidence-aware weighting: uncertain tokens with small \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c), indicating a low recovery chance, have a smaller weight, while confident tokens with large \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) are upweighted. The sharpness is controlled by parameter \u03b2 and the blend by \u03c9. Furthermore, the convex interpolation of the confidence-aware coefficient of the upper bound with the lower bound ensures clipping tiny gradients to a minimum value and thus prevents vanishing gradients. \u2022 Lower variance and more stable training: According to Proposition 1, the gradient of the optimal mixture, i.e., g\u03c9\u22c6 k,k, has strictly smaller coordinate-wise variance than the gradient of either the lower bound (g0,k) or the upper bound (g1,k)1. In our experiments, we fix \u03b2 and \u03c9 as hyperparameters for simplicity. These values can also be adaptively adjusted during training to better match the evolving training dynamics and data distribution. Thus, the mixture approach offers theoretical advantages over using either the upper or lower bound alone, as supported by our experimental results in Section 4. Further discussions of the mixture approach and empirical evidence of reduced gradient variance are provided in Appendix C.2 and Figure 7, and Appendix C.3 presents a toy example illustrating the distinct behaviors of the lower and upper bounds. 4 Experiments In this section, we present experimental results highlighting the superior performance of SPG across various benchmarks. Further, we provide detailed analysis and ablations of SPG to assess the contribution of each", "and Appendix C.3 presents a toy example illustrating the distinct behaviors of the lower and upper bounds. 4 Experiments In this section, we present experimental results highlighting the superior performance of SPG across various benchmarks. Further, we provide detailed analysis and ablations of SPG to assess the contribution of each component, examine the influence of key hyperparameters, and evaluate the robustness of our approach under different inference strategies. 4.1 Experimental Setup and Main Results Experimental Setup. We conduct RL fine-tuning with SPG following the experimental settings in D1 (Zhao et al., 2025) and WD1 (Tang et al., 2025). We employ LLaDA-8B-Instruct (Nie et al., 2025), a state-of-the-art open-sourced dLLM without post-training, as the base model, and experiment on four benchmarks: two for mathematical reasoning (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023)) and two for logical reasoning (Countdown (Pan et al., 2025) and Sudoku (Arel, 2025)). We follow the same train-test splitting, reward functions, and evaluation protocol as D1 and WD1, except for Sudoku. For Sudoku, to avoid train-test leakage, we take the training set from D1 and split the data by Sudoku answers, ensuring that the test set contains entirely new puzzle solutions. This guarantees that the model cannot solve test puzzles merely by memorizing possible answers. All experiments are conducted in the zero-shot setting, except for Sudoku, where 3-shot generation is used for both training and evaluation2. For all models, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a rank of r = 128 and scaling factor \u03b1 = 64. For SPG, we report results using both 1Proposition 1 extends directly to a single, coordinate-independent optimizer \u03c9\u22c6obtained by minimizing the sum of coordinate-wise variances. 2We use 3-shot generation for Sudoku because zero-shot is too difficult for this task, resulting in very few meaningful RL rollouts. Few-shot examples used in our experiments are provided in Section D.3. 6 Table 1 Model performance on four reasoning benchmarks. The best results are bolded and the second best are underlined. SPG consistently outperforms all other methods. We denote the absolute gain of test accuracy to the previous state-of-the-art in green.

We report mean and standard deviation over a rolling window of 50 steps. \u02dcLEUBO (i.e., SPG w/ EUBO) and \u02dcLMix (i.e., SPG w/ Mixture) for negative advantage traces. We select the value of \u03b2 in the EUBO from {1.0, 1.5, 2.0} based on the best average test accuracy across all generation lengths, and fix the mixture coefficient \u03c9 at 0.5. Further experimental details are in Section D.1 and Section D.2. Baselines. We compare our method with several recent RL algorithms for dLLMs, including D1 (Zhao et al., 2025), WD1 (Tang et al., 2025), and UniGRPO (Yang et al., 2025). For D1 and WD1, we reproduce results using the official codebases and instructions, and for fair comparison, we omit the additional SFT stage in D1 across all models. For UniGRPO, since the code is not publicly available and the original work focuses on vision-language multimodal models, we reimplement the algorithm within our setup. For consistency, we set the number of inner gradient updates \u00b5 to 4 for all models, following GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). We also evaluate LLaDA-1.5 (Zhu et al., 2025) under our settings, which fine-tune LLaDA-8B-Instruct using VRPO, a preference optimization approach on 350K preference pairs. Generation and Evaluation Setup. For both RL rollouts and evaluation, we use the semi-autoregressive confidence- based decoding strategy, following LLaDA, D1 and WD1. We apply the same generation setup as D1, with the denoising timestep set to half the total sequence length. The sequence is divided into blocks of 32 tokens, and in diffusion step, we unmask the 2 tokens with the highest confidence (measured by the probability of the sampled token) within the current incomplete block. During RL rollout, to encourage diverse outputs, we use a generation length of 256 and a sampling temperature of 0.9 across all benchmarks, except for sudoku, where the temperature is set to 0.3 as in D1. During evaluation, the sampling temperature is set to 0.0. We evaluate the models every 100 steps, reporting results from the checkpoint that achieves the highest average test accuracy across generation lengths of 128, 256, and 512. Results. We provide the performance of SPG on each benchmark in comparison to the base model and other baselines in Table 1. Both SPG w/ EUBO and SPG w/ Mixture consistently achieve significant improvements over the baselines across all tasks and generation lengths, with the Mixture approach that combines ELBO and EUBO for negative advantage traces yielding the best performance. In particular, at a generation length of 256, SPG w/ Mixture improves the test accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art", "Mixture consistently achieve significant improvements over the baselines across all tasks and generation lengths, with the Mixture approach that combines ELBO and EUBO for negative advantage traces yielding the best performance.

Unless otherwise noted, we report average test accuracy across generation lengths 128, 256, and 512 for the ablation studies, with detailed results for each generation length provided in Section E.2. In Section E.2, we also investigate alternative log-likelihood estimation methods for positive advantage traces in place of ELBO, as detailed in Table 11, and study the diversity of model generations by evaluating the pass@K performance of each model in Table 12. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Steps 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Reward SPG w/ ELBO SPG w/ EUBO SPG w/ Mixture Figure 4 Reward dynamics of different log- likelihood estimation methods for negative ad- vantage traces on Sudoku.

SPG w/ Mixture leads to both fast convergence and high rewards. Ablations on Algorithm Components. We first study the impact of different log-likelihood estimation methods for negative advantage traces in Table 2. Specifically, we compare our approach using \u02dcLEUBO or \u02dcLMix with those using LELBO (SPG w/ ELBO) or omitting the negative advantage loss entirely (SPG wo/ neg). Removing the negative advantage loss results in a substantial performance drop, highlighting the importance of negative advantage penalties to RL. Additionally, both Mixture and EUBO methods outperform ELBO (except for EUBO in MATH500), showcasing the benefits of evidence upper bound regularization for negative rewards. We provide complete results for each generation length in Table 6. The effect of log-likelihood estimation methods is further illustrated by the reward dynamics of each model in Figure 4, taking Sudoku as an example. SPG w/ ELBO converges rapidly during training but plateaus early, as minimizing the lower bound does not necessarily minimize the true log-likelihood for negative advantage traces. In contrast, SPG w/ EUBO achieves higher final rewards but converges more slowly and less stably. Combining both, SPG w/ Mixture attains fast, stable convergence and high rewards, leading to an effective balance. This aligns with our discussions in Section 3.3. We also conduct ablations on the masking strategies in Monte Carlo estimation of LELBO, \u02dcLEUBO, and \u02dcLMix. As shown in Table 3, the block-wise masking strategy outperforms random masking, demonstrating the importance of aligning input distributions between policy rollout and optimization. We provide complete results for each generation length in Table 7. Ablations on Key Hyperparameters \u03b2 and \u03c9. We first examine the effect of \u03b2, a crucial hyperparameter in evidence upper bound estimation, in panels (a)-(d) of Figure 5. In general, a relatively small value of \u03b2 (i.e., close to 1.0) leads to a tighter bound and thus better performance.

We set generation length to 256 and report the average accuracy across four benchmarks. SPG consistently outperforms all baselines by a large margin across different inference strategies. on most tasks, indicating its robustness. For our main results in Table 1, we fix \u03c9 = 0.5 and select the optimal \u03b2 \u22651, resulting in \u03b2 = 1.0 for Sudoku and \u03b2 = 1.5 for the other three benchmarks, except for Countdown with SPG w/ EUBO where \u03b2 = 2.0. Besides, since the ELBO corresponds to the case of \u03b2 = 0 theoretically and EUBO corresponds to \u03b2 \u22651, we also investigate intermediate values 0 < \u03b2 < 1, which may serve as an implicit mixture of lower and upper bounds. However, it is unstable in Sudoku and underperform SPG w/ Mixture on most benchmarks. We also experiment on the effect of the mixture coefficient \u03c9, keeping \u03b2 fixed at its optimal value determined for \u03c9 = 0.5 as mentioned before. As illustrated in panels (e)-(f) of Figure 5, combining lower and upper bounds with \u03c9 \u2208(0, 1) leads to better performance than leveraging either bound solely, resulting in an inverted U-shaped curve. This observation is consistent with our analysis in Proposition 1 and Section 3.3. We provide complete ablation results of \u03b2 and \u03c9 for each generation length in Table 8 and Table 9. Ablations on Inference Strategies. In the above experiments, we adopt a consistent state-of-the-art inference setup during both RL rollout and evaluation, i.e., confidence-based, block-wise semi-autoregressive generation with a block size of 32. The same configuration and block size are also used in our block-wise masking strategy. This raises the question of whether our approach generalizes well to alternative inference strategies. To assess this, we evaluate the base model and all RL fine-tuned models using various inference strategies, as shown in Figure 6. Despite being trained under confidence-based semi-AR decoding, SPG consistently outperforms all baselines by a substantial margin across all inference strategies, demonstrating its robustness and strong generalizability. Complete results for each benchmark individually are provided in Table 13. 5 Related Work Diffusion Language Models. Building on the remarkable success of diffusion models for image generation in continuous domains (Song et al., 2020; Ho et al., 2020), researchers have explored their extension to discrete data such as text. Initial attempts focused on training continuous diffusion models in the text embedding space (Li et al., 2022; Gong et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2025a), while they face challenges in optimization and generalization due to the discrete nature of text data. Masked", "data such as text. Initial attempts focused on training continuous diffusion models in the text embedding space (Li et al., 2022; Gong et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2025a), while they face challenges in optimization and generalization due to the discrete nature of text data. Masked diffusion models (Lou et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Campbell et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024) address this by defining the diffusion process directly in the discrete token space, using random masking as the forward process, and have achieved strong empirical results. Block Diffusion (Arriola 9 et al., 2025) further advances this direction by combining the strengths of autoregressive models, such as the capability to generate variable-length outputs and using KV cache to accelerate inference, with the benefits of diffusion language models like parallel decoding and flexible, any-order generation within blocks. Recently, large-scale diffusion language models trained with masked diffusion objectives have demonstrated performance competitive with similarly sized autoregressive models (Nie et al., 2025; Gong et al., 2024). More recent works (Wu et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025a; Sahoo et al., 2025a,b) have introduced caching and parallel decoding algorithms that greatly enhance the inference efficiency of dLLMs. Reinforcement Learning for LLMs and Reasoning. The seminal works apply reinforcement learning to large language models (LLMs) to align them with human preferences via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022). More recently, reinforcement learning has proven highly effective at enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs during the post-training stage, where rewards can be provided by a process reward model (Lightman et al., 2023) or verifiable reward signals. Algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) constrain policy updates to a trust region, reducing variance and promoting stable learning by preventing excessive shifts from the reference policy (Schulman et al., 2015, 2017). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) introduces group-relative rewards, enabling efficient training without the need for an additional value (critic) model. GRPO and its variants have demonstrated strong empirical performance in state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), particularly on mathematical reasoning tasks, where incorporating long reasoning traces with self-reflection and verification steps yields significant improvements. Recent works (Liu et al., 2025b; Zheng et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Cohen et al., 2025) further improve RL algorithms for LLMs by reducing the bias introduced by the GRPO objective, enhancing sample efficiency, and introducing additional regularization. Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Language Models. Numerous studies have explored RL-based fine-tuning algorithms for diffusion models with continuous objectives (Fan et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023; Clark et al., 2023). While RL algorithms have achieved notable success to LLMs and continuous diffusion models, their applications to diffusion language models in the discrete space remain underexplored. DRAKES (Wang et al., 2024) leverages reward backpropagation along the denoising trajectory, but is computationally intensive for large scale models as the gradients are propagated through each denoising step. Alternatively, methods like D1", "LLMs and continuous diffusion models, their applications to diffusion language models in the discrete space remain underexplored. DRAKES (Wang et al., 2024) leverages reward backpropagation along the denoising trajectory, but is computationally intensive for large scale models as the gradients are propagated through each denoising step. Alternatively, methods like D1 (Zhao et al., 2025) and UniGRPO Yang et al. (2025) utilize the GRPO framework, approximating the log-likelihood through either a one-step unmasking (as in D1) or Monte Carlo estimation using the ELBO (as in UniGRPO). VRPO (Zhu et al., 2025) adapts DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) to fine-tune dLLMs by applying MC estimation of the ELBO. WD1 (Tang et al., 2025) starts from the GRPO formulation and the same log-likelihood estimation as in D1, while avoiding direct estimation of the old and reference policy log-likelihoods by integrating them into a weighted policy optimization objective. Despite these advances, a principled analysis of RL algorithms for dLLMs, especially the challenging log-likelihood estimation, is missing. This results in substantial bias in the optimization objective and suboptimal performance. 6 Conclusion We propose SPG, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion large language models. SPG addresses the intractable log-likelihood in dLLMs by maximizing a tractable lower bound on positive reward sequences and minimizing an upper bound on negative ones, resulting in a more robust and less biased policy gradient. Additionally, we propose a block-wise masking strategy for Monte Carlo estimation to enhance optimization stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on four mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SPG, achieving significant improvement over baselines and the state-of-the-art performance. 10 References Arel.

(2024) for more details. Notation. We denote scalars by lowercase letters (x), vectors by bold lowercase (x), and sequences by x1:n. A superscript (e.g., xj) denotes an item\u2019s index within a group. We define the set of the first k integers as [k] := {1, . . . , k} and the k-dimensional probability simplex as \u2206k\u22121. Distributions include the categorical Cat(\u00b7 | p) and the uniform U[a, b]. Throughout the paper, we use the following primary indices: i \u2208[n] for position, j \u2208[g] for a sequence in a group, and t \u2208[0, 1] for the continuous diffusion timestep. We start from a discrete time version of the diffusion models with finite t \u2208[T]. Assume a one-hot categorical variable x \u2208{e1, . . . , ek} \u2282\u2206k\u22121. Further assume we gradually corrupt x into an absorbing state m (i.e., e[mask] ) with transition matrix Qt at time t. Then: q(zt | x) = Cat(zt | Qtx) = Cat(zt | tY \u03c4=1 Q\u03c4x). Here, zt is also a one-hot categorical random variable in \u2206k\u22121. In practice, one", "\u2282\u2206k\u22121. Further assume we gradually corrupt x into an absorbing state m (i.e., e[mask] ) with transition matrix Qt at time t. Then: q(zt | x) = Cat(zt | Qtx) = Cat(zt | tY \u03c4=1 Q\u03c4x). Here, zt is also a one-hot categorical random variable in \u2206k\u22121. In practice, one could choose Qt such that: q(zt | x) = Cat(zt | \u03b1tx + (1 \u2212\u03b1t)m). Here, \u03b11 = 1, \u03b1T = 0, \u03b1\u2032 t < 0. Normally, the goal is to construct the lower bound of the evidence (ELBO) and maximize it. For this particular case, consider the discretized Markov chain with T latent variables z1, z2, . . . , zT , where zT = m and z1 = x. We use the shorthand z = z1:T and write LELBO(x; \u03b8) = Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 log p\u03b8(x, z) q(z | x) \u0015 =Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 log p\u03b8(x | z1) | {z } =0 + T \u22121 X t=1 log p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) + log p\u03b8(zT ) q(zT | x) | {z } =0 \u0015 = T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt,zt+1\u223cq \u0014 log p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) \u0015 = T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x)Ezt\u223cq(\u00b7|zt+1,x) \u0014 log p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) \u0015 . (10) Here, log p\u03b8(x, z1) = 0 because we assume z1 = x, and p\u03b8(zT ) = q(zT | x) because we assume zT = m. A common method to parameterize p\u03b8 is via predicting x with model \u03c0\u03b8 in q: p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) = q (zt | zt+1, x = \u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7 | zt+1)) . Now, given that zt+1 is either m or x (assuming m \u0338= x). Then the KL term in equation 10 decomposes into the following. log p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 0 zt = zt+1 = x, 0 zt = m, zt+1 = x, (Impossible) log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt+1) zt = x, zt+1 = m, 0 zt = zt+1 = m. (11) 14 Moreover, q(zt = x | zt+1 = m, x) = \u03b1t\u2212\u03b1t+1 1\u2212\u03b1t+1 , and note that \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt) = 1 when zt = x, so we have: LELBO(x; \u03b8) = T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014\u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt+1)1(zt+1 = m) \u0015 = T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014\u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt+1) \u0015 . (If zt+1 = x, then log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt+1) = 0) (12) Taking the above limit as T \u2192\u221e, we have: LELBO(x; \u03b8) = Z 1 t=0 Ezt\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 \u03b1\u2032 t \u03b1t \u22121 log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt) \u0015 . (13) Generalization to Sequence The above is for a single categorical variable x. In practice as in language modeling, it becomes a sequence of categorical variables x1:n. Then we write LELBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = Ez1:n\u223cq(\u00b7|x1:n) \u0014 log p\u03b8(x1:n, z1:n) q(z1:n | x1:n) \u0015 = E{zi\u223cq(\u00b7|xi)}n i=1 \u0014 n X i=1 log p\u03b8(xi, z1:n) q(zi | xi) \u0015 (Independence of q(\u00b7 | xi)) = n X i=1 E{zi\u2032\u223cq(\u00b7|xi\u2032)}n i\u2032=1 \u0014 log p\u03b8(xi, z1:n)", "a sequence of categorical variables x1:n. Then we write LELBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = Ez1:n\u223cq(\u00b7|x1:n) \u0014 log p\u03b8(x1:n, z1:n) q(z1:n | x1:n) \u0015 = E{zi\u223cq(\u00b7|xi)}n i=1 \u0014 n X i=1 log p\u03b8(xi, z1:n) q(zi | xi) \u0015 (Independence of q(\u00b7 | xi)) = n X i=1 E{zi\u2032\u223cq(\u00b7|xi\u2032)}n i\u2032=1 \u0014 log p\u03b8(xi, z1:n) q(zi | xi) \u0015 = n X i=1 LELBO(xi; \u03b8). (14) The key distinction from the single-token formulation (mentioned beforehand) is that the reverse process p\u03b8 is conditioned on all z1:n instead of a single token\u2019s zi. B Evidence Upper Bound for dLLMs In this section, we provide the derivation of the evidence upper bound. Following the above section, we start from the discrete time version of the diffusion models. Lemma 1 (R\u00e9nyi Variational Bound; R\u00e9nyi (1961); Van Erven and Harremos (2014)). Fix an observation x. Let q(\u00b7 | x) be any distribution on Z such that p(\u00b7 | x) \u226aq(\u00b7 | x), denoting that p(\u00b7 | x) is absolutely continuous with respect to q(\u00b7 | z). Then, the following holds for any \u03b2 \u22651: Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 log p(x, z) q(z | x) \u0015 \u2264log p(x) \u22641 \u03b2 log Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \"\u0012 p(x, z) q(z | x) \u0013\u03b2# . (15) In view of the above lemma, we derive an evidence upper bound for masked diffusion models in the following theorem. Theorem 1 (Evidence Upper Bound for Masked Diffusion). Assume the forward denoising process has T steps with a monotonic schedule \u03b1t. For any \u03b2 \u22651 and a sequence of categorical variables x1:n, we have: log \u03c0\u03b8(x1:n) \u2264LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8), (16) where LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) := 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1 \" \u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u00b7 1(zt+1,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt+1) # + C(T), (17) and C(T) = ( 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) h q(z1:T | x)\u2212ni , 1 \u2264\u03b2 < n 0, \u03b2 \u2265n is a constant independent of \u03b8. 15 Proof. We first consider the case with a single categorical variable x. On the account of Lemma 1 and following a similar argument as in equation 10, for any \u03b2 \u22651, we can write log \u03c0\u03b8(x) \u22641 \u03b2 log Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \"\u0012p\u03b8(x, z) q(z | x) \u0013\u03b2# = 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 (18) Note that the sequence z1:T has a form {x, . . . , x, m, . . . , m}. Define the transition event: At := {zt = x, zt+1 = m} (19) Then, by the law of total expectations, equation 18 can be expressed as: 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt | zt+1) q(zt | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 log T \u22121 X t=1 P(At)Ez\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \"T \u22121 Y s=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zs | zs+1) q(zs | zs+1, x) \u0013\u03b2 At # = 1 \u03b2 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 1(zt+1 = m)q(zt = x | zt+1 = m, x) \u0012 p\u03b8(zt = x | zt+1 = m) q(zt = x | zt+1 = m, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015", "Y s=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zs | zs+1) q(zs | zs+1, x) \u0013\u03b2 At # = 1 \u03b2 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 1(zt+1 = m)q(zt = x | zt+1 = m, x) \u0012 p\u03b8(zt = x | zt+1 = m) q(zt = x | zt+1 = m, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 1(zt+1 = m)\u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(x | zt+1) \u0015 (20) The penultimate line is due to the fact that conditioned on the event At, the ratio p\u03b8(zs|zs+1) q(zs|zs+1,x) is equal to one for any s \u0338= t. The last line uses the formula for q. The indicator 1(zt = m) appears in the final expression because the terms in the bound are only non-trivial when the model must make a prediction from a corrupted state. Now we generalize the above to a sequence of categorical variables x = x1:n. Similar as Equation (18), we have log \u03c0\u03b8(x1:n) \u22641 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 n Y i=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 Denote \u02dcC(T) := 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) h q(z1:T | x)\u2212ni . The upper bound in the RHS can be further derived as 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 n Y i=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 q(z1:T | x)\u2212n n Y i=1 X yi 1:T q(yi 1:T | x)1(yi 1:T = z1:T ) T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(yi t,i | yi t+1 q(yi t,i | yi t+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 \u22641 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 q(z1:T | x)\u2212n n Y i=1 X yi 1:T q(yi 1:T | x) T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(yi t,i | yi t+1 q(yi t,i | yi t+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) h q(z1:T | x)\u2212ni \u00b7 \u0012 n Y i=1 X yi 1:T q(yi 1:T | x) T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(yi t,i | yi t+1 q(yi t,i | yi t+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0013! = 1 \u03b2 log n Y i=1 Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 + 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) h q(z1:T | x)\u2212ni = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 + \u02dcC(T) (21) 16 Here, yi 1:T are copies of z1:T enforced to agree with z1:T using the indicator 1(yi 1:T = z1:T ). C(T) is a constant independent of \u03b8, and the first term in Equation (21) can be derived similar to the single variable case in Equation (20): 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \" \u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u00b7 1(zt+1,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt+1) # Additionally, for \u03b2 \u2265n, we can obtain a tighter bound using H\u00f6lder\u2019s inequality: 1", "\u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \" \u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u00b7 1(zt+1,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt+1) # Additionally, for \u03b2 \u2265n, we can obtain a tighter bound using H\u00f6lder\u2019s inequality: 1 \u03b2 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 n Y i=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013\u03b2\u0015 = 1 n\u03b2 n X i=1 log Ez1:T \u223cq(\u00b7|x) \u0014 T \u22121 Y t=1 \u0012 p\u03b8(zt,i | zt+1) q(zt,i | zt+1, x) \u0013n\u03b2\u0015 = 1 n\u03b2 n X i=1 log T \u22121 X t=1 Ezt+1\u223cq(\u00b7|x) \" \u03b1t \u2212\u03b1t+1 1 \u2212\u03b1t+1 \u00b7 1(zt+1,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0n\u03b2 \u03b8 (xi | zt+1) # (22) Denote \u02dc\u03b2 := n\u03b2. Then the upper bound log \u03c0\u03b8(x1:n) \u2264LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) holds with the constant term C(T) being zero and the hyperparameter \u02dc\u03b2 \u2265n. Combining these two cases, we have C(T) = ( \u02dcC(T), 1 \u2264\u03b2 < n 0, \u03b2 \u2265n . Furthermore, we can derive the continuous time version by omitting the constant term that does not affect the gradient with respect to \u03b8, and taking the limit of T \u2192\u221esimilar as the derivations for LELBO, as shown in Corollary 1: Corollary 1. Taking the limit of T \u2192\u221e, we have: \u2207\u03b8LEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = \u2207\u03b8 \u0010 \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) + C(T) \u0011 = \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8), where \u02dcLEUBO(x1:n; \u03b8) = 1 \u03b2 n X i=1 log Et,zt h w(t) \u00b7 1(zt,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt) i . (23) One caveat of the above \u02dcLEUBO is that the log is outside of the expectation, which in general makes Monte Carlo sample estimates biased. One could certainly further loosen the bound using the inequality log x \u2264x \u22121: LEUBO(x) \u22641 \u03b2 n X i=1 Et\u223cU[0,1],zt\u223cq \" w(t) \u00b7 1(zt,i = m) \u00b7 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt) # \u2212n \u03b2 (24) But in practice we found this results in much worse performance, as demonstrated in Table 10, potentially due to the much larger gap between EUBO and likelihood. C Additional Analysis on Upper and Lower Bounds C.1 Proof of Proposition 1 Proposition 1 (Optimal Mixture Strictly Reduces Variance). Fix a coordinate k and let \u03c1\u03b2 := w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c)/E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) i , 17 where w(t, zt) := w(t)1(zt = m). Then, the gradient of mixture objective (8) is given by g\u03c9,k = ((1 \u2212\u03c9)w(t, zt) + \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2) \u2202\u03b8k log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt, c). (25) If Var((\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w(t, zt))\u2202\u03b8k log \u03c0\u03b8(x | zt, c)) > 0, then Var[g\u03c9,k] is a strictly convex quadratic in \u03c9 and thus admits a unique minimizer \u03c9\u22c6 k. Moreover, Var[g\u03c9\u22c6 k,k] < min \b Var[g0,k], Var[g1,k] , Proof. We first derive the formulas for the gradient of each objective. Consider a specific example xi. The gradient of the LELBO and \u02dcLELBO are given by: \u2207\u03b8LELBO = E [w(t, zt)\u2207log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c)] (26) \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO = E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c)\u2207log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c) i E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi", "gradient of each objective. Consider a specific example xi. The gradient of the LELBO and \u02dcLELBO are given by: \u2207\u03b8LELBO = E [w(t, zt)\u2207log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c)] (26) \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO = E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c)\u2207log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c) i E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) i (27) Then the gradient of the mixture objective \u02dcLMix is given by: \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLMix = E h\u0010 (1 \u2212\u03c9)w(t, zt) + \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2 \u0011 \u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c) i (28) We further compute the per-parameter (per-dimension) variance of the gradient of \u02dcLMix and consider the optimal mixture coefficient \u03c9 to minimize the variance. For simplicity, we use the following short-hand notation: sk := \u2202\u03b8k log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c) We denote the k-th coordinate of the gradient \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLMix by g\u03c9,k. Then, the coordinate-wise variance of the gradient is given by Var \u0002 g\u03c9,k \u0003 = E h\u0000(1 \u2212\u03c9) w + \u03c9 \u03c1\u03b2 \u00012 s2 k i \u2212 \u0010 E \u0002\u0000(1 \u2212\u03c9) w + \u03c9 \u03c1\u03b2 \u0001 sk \u0003\u00112 = Var(wsk) + 2\u03c9 Cov(wsk, (\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w)sk) + \u03c92 Var((\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w)sk) where we used the shorthand w \u2261w(t, zt). The above expression is quadratic in \u03c9 and we find the optimal \u03c9 by setting the derivative of variance to zero: \u2202 \u2202\u03c9 Var \u0002 g\u03c9,k \u0003 = 2 Cov \u0000w sk, (\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w) sk \u0001 + 2\u03c9 Var \u0000(\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w) sk \u0001 = 0 \u21d2\u03c9\u22c6 k = \u2212Cov \u0000w sk, (\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w) sk \u0001 Var \u0000(\u03c1\u03b2 \u2212w) sk \u0001 . The above yields a per-coordinate optimal \u03c9\u22c6 k.

Consider the ratio of the coefficient of score function \u2207\u03b8 log \u03c0\u03b8(xi | zt, c) in the gradient in the case of the mixture objective (i.e., \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLMix in Equation (28)) over using only the lower bound (i.e., \u2207\u03b8LELBO in Equation (26)): wMix wELBO = (1 \u2212\u03c9)w(t, zt) + \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2 w(t, zt) = (1 \u2212\u03c9) + \u03c9 \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) i Treating the expectation over all samples E h w(t, zt)\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) i as a constant (since it is averaged), the second term in the above ratio is strictly increasing in \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c). This realizes a confidence-aware weighting: uncertain tokens with small \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c), i.e., those with a low recovery chance, have a smaller weight, while confident tokens with large \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) are upweighted, with sharpness being controlled by parameter \u03b2 and the blend by \u03c9. Comparing Mixture with the Upper Bound. We compute the ratio of coefficient of score function in the gradient of upper bound (i.e., \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO in Equation (27)) over the mixture gradient: wEUBO wMix = \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2 (1 \u2212\u03c9)w(t, zt) + \u03c9\u03c1\u03b2 Considering the above ratio, when \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(xi | zt, c) is very small, the coefficient of score function in \u2207\u03b8 \u02dcLEUBO, wEUBO, becomes very small, preventing updates to the parameters. However, the mixing approach maintains per-sample weights by preventing that from collapsing to (near) zero. In other words, for each sample, the mixture coefficient computes a convex interpolation that simultaneously floors very small EUBO weights to a minimum value and applies an uncertainty-aware capping to large EUBO weights. Empirical Evidence of Reduced Gradient Variance. As a practical indicator of gradient variance, we plot the gradient norm of each model trained with different log-likelihood estimation methods for negative advantage traces in Figure 7. When using the mixture objective, the model has consistently smaller and more stable gradient norm throughout training, aligning well with our theoretical analysis. 19 C.3 Toy Example for Upper and Lower Bounds. In this section, we provide a toy example highlighting the contrasting behaviors and landscapes of the upper and lower bounds, further demonstrating the necessity to select the appropriate bound for", "stable gradient norm throughout training, aligning well with our theoretical analysis. 19 C.3 Toy Example for Upper and Lower Bounds. In this section, we provide a toy example highlighting the contrasting behaviors and landscapes of the upper and lower bounds, further demonstrating the necessity to select the appropriate bound for optimization based on the optimization direction. Consider a simple case where the sequence length is 2 and the vocabulary size is 2, i.e., x = [x1, x2] and V = {A, B}. Then, We can calculate LELBO and \u02dcLEUBO in closed form: LELBO(x = AA) = 1 2 h log \u03c0\u03b8(x1 = A | MA) + log \u03c0\u03b8(x1 = A | MM) (29) + log \u03c0\u03b8(x2 = A | AM) + log \u03c0\u03b8(x2 = A | MM) i (30) \u02dcLEUBO(x = AA) = 1 \u03b2 log \u0010\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(x1 = A | MA) + \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(x1 = A | MM) 2 \u0011 (31) + 1 \u03b2 log \u0010\u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(x2 = A | AM) + \u03c0\u03b2 \u03b8(x2 = A | MM) 2 \u0011 (32) For simplicity, denote a := \u03c0\u03b8(x1 = A | MA) and b := \u03c0\u03b8(x1 = A | MM), and consider the of the likelihood of the first token x1. We have LELBO(x1) = 1 2(log a + log b) (33) \u02dcLEUBO(x1) = 1 \u03b2 log \u0010a\u03b2 + b\u03b2 2 \u0011 (34) Take the partial gradient with respect to a and b respectively, \u2202LELBO(x1) \u2202a = 1 2a; \u2202LELBO(x1) \u2202b = 1 2b (35) \u2202\u02dcLEUBO(x1) \u2202a = a\u03b2\u22121 a\u03b2 + b\u03b2 ; \u2202\u02dcLEUBO(x1) \u2202b = b\u03b2\u22121 a\u03b2 + b\u03b2 (36) Therefore, for \u02dcLEUBO, the gradient direction is dominated by the larger one between a and b, while for LELBO, the gradient direction is dominated by the smaller one. Such property is illustrated in the landscapes of \u2212LELBO and \u2212\u02dcLEUBO for a, b \u2208(0, 1) in Figure 8. When x = AA has negative advantage, the corresponding LELBO and \u02dcLEUBO are minimized. For LELBO, the model benefits more from further decreasing the smaller one between probabilities a and b. In the extreme case, LELBO = \u2212\u221e when either a or b equals to zero, leaving the other term not sufficiently decreased. Instead, when using \u02dcLEUBO for negative advantage traces, the larger one between a and b is preferentially minimized, leading to a more balanced optimization that stably decreases the log-likelihood. Similarly, when x = AA has positive advantage, the corresponding LELBO and \u02dcLEUBO are maximized. Using LELBO enables effectively increasing the smaller likelihood, while \u02dcLEUBO focuses on the larger one, leading to a less efficient optimization. D Additional Experimental Details D.1 Datasets and Reward Functions We follow the setting in D1 (Zhao et al., 2025) and WD1 (Tang et al., 2025), using the same reward functions and train-test splitting, except for Sudoku. The rewards are designed to encourage both correctness and proper formatting, with varying levels of granularity tailored for each task. For completeness, we provide details as follows. 20 Figure 8 Landscapes of \u2212LELBO and \u2212\u02dcLEUBO for 0 < a, b < 1. \u2212\u02dcLEUBO is flatter among low value regions while", "The rewards are designed to encourage both correctness and proper formatting, with varying levels of granularity tailored for each task.

GSM8K. We utilize the train split of the GSM8K dataset3 for RL training, and evaluate model performance on the test split. We follow the Unsloth reward setup4, utilizing five equally-weighted additive components: \u2022 XML Structure Reward: +0.125 per correct formatting tag; small penalties for extra contents after the closing tag. \u2022 Soft Format Reward: +0.5 for outputs matching the pattern: <reasoning>...</reasoning><answer>...</answer> \u2022 Strict Format Reward: +0.5 for exact formatting with correct line breaks. \u2022 Integer Answer Reward: +0.5 if the answer is a valid integer. \u2022 Correctness Reward: +2.0 of the answer matches the ground truth. MATH500. We utilize the train split of the MATH dataset5 for RL training, and evaluate model performance on the test split. We use a format reward and a correctness reward: \u2022 Format Reward: We award 1.00 if <answer></answer> tags are present with \\boxed inside them; 0.75 if answer tags are present without \\boxed; 0.50 if answer tags are not present but \\boxed is present; 0.25 if neither the answer tags nor \\boxed is present. \u2022 Correctness Reward: We award 2.00 if the answer in \\boxed{} matches the ground truth. Countdown. We utilize the train split of the Countdown dataset6 for RL training, restricting to instances that use only three numbers. We evaluate on the same set of 256 synthetically generated countdown questions with 3 numbers as in D1 (Zhao et al., 2025). The reward covers three cases: +1.0 if the expression reaches the target using the exact numbers; +0.1 if the numbers are correct but does not reach the target; +0.0 otherwise. Sudoku. We experiment on the 4\u00d74 Sudoku dataset7 generated by Arel (2025). The original training split contains 1M unique Sudoku puzzles covering all 288 4\u00d74 Soduku solutions. To avoid train-test leakage and potential cheating by memorizing all the solutions, we randomly select 200 solutions and include all puzzles corresponding to these solutions into the new training set, resulting in 694,006 training puzzles. We then randomly select 2 or 3 puzzles corresponding to the left 88 solutions to construct the test set, which has 256 Soduku puzzles in total. 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k 4https://unsloth.ai/blog/r1-reasoning 5https://huggingface.co/datasets/ankner/math-500 6https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiayi-Pan/Countdown-Tasks-3to4 7https://github.com/Black-Phoenix/4x4-Sudoku-Dataset 21 We observe that the zero-shot setting is too difficult for the base LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, which has test accuracy below 7% with a generation length of 256 and struggles to correctly interpret the questions, leading to very few meaningful RL rollouts. Therefore, we instead use 3-shot for all the Sudoku experiments. We ensure that the solutions presented in the 3-shot samples do not appear in test set solutions, and the puzzles do not appear in both train and test set. The detailed few-shot samples are provided in Section D.3. D.2 Hyperparameter Settings and Implementation Details", "3-shot for all the Sudoku experiments. We ensure that the solutions presented in the 3-shot samples do not appear in test set solutions, and the puzzles do not appear in both train and test set. The detailed few-shot samples are provided in Section D.3. D.2 Hyperparameter Settings and Implementation Details We follow D1 (Zhao et al., 2025) for most hyperparameter settings. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a rank of r = 128 and scaling factor \u03b1 = 64. The training was conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100-80G or NVIDIA H100-80G GPU, with the following hyperparameters: batch size of 6 per GPU, and gradient accumulation steps of 2. We set the number of inner gradient update \u00b5 as 4 for all models. We use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.99, weight decay of 0.1, learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22126, and gradient clipping at 0.2. We utilize Flash Attention 2 (Dao, 2023)and 4-bit quantization. For RL rollout, we use sequence length of 256 tokens, and 128 diffusion steps. We employ confidence-based semi- autoregressive generation with block size 32, and set the temperature as 0.9 (except for Sudoku where temperature is set as 0.3 following D1). We set number of completions per prompt g as 6, and number of Monte Carlo estimation samples m as 2 due to computational constraint. Since the rollout stage dominates the training time, the average time per gradient update step for SPG is similar to that of the other baselines. We train 6000 steps (i.e., number of gradient updates) for GSM8K and Countdown, 4000 steps for MATH500, and 2500 steps for Sudoku. For all RL models, we run evaluation every 100 steps with generation sequence length 128, 256, 512, and report the result of the checkpoint with the highest average accuracy over the three generation lengths, except for the ablations on inference strategies in Table 13, where we only evaluate on generation length 256.

Note that the reported numbers of each method for \u201cSemi-AR, Block=32, Confidence\u201d is in general slightly higher than the results in Table 1 under the same inference setting. This is because in Table 13, we select best checkpoint specifically for generation length 256 to maintain consistency with other inference settings, while in Table 1, we choose the checkpoint with the highest average accuracy across generation lengths 128, 256, and 512. Ablations on the Looser Upper Bound. As mentioned in Section 3.2 and Section B, a looser but unbiased bound can be derived using inequalities like log(x) \u2264x \u22121, i.e., \u02dcLLoose (Equation (24)). However, as shown in Table 10, this looser bound performs worse empirically than the tighter upper bound \u02dcLEUBO we used, possibly due to a larger discrepancy from the true log-likelihood.

In all previous experiments, we apply greedy sampling by setting temperature as 0.0 following D1 and LLaDA. However, beyond accuracy, it is essential for models to generate a diverse set of outputs that can cover the correct solution and allow for explorations. In this section, we investigate the models\u2019 ability to generate diverse outputs using a higher temperature, and evaluate their Pass@K performance on MATH500 and Countdown, as shown in Table 12. Specifically, we set temperature to 0.9 and generation length to 256, conduct evaluations", "the correct solution and allow for explorations. In this section, we investigate the models\u2019 ability to generate diverse outputs using a higher temperature, and evaluate their Pass@K performance on MATH500 and Countdown, as shown in Table 12. Specifically, we set temperature to 0.9 and generation length to 256, conduct evaluations every 26 100 steps, and report results from the checkpoint with the highest accuracy. For comparison, we also include results from greedy sampling, denoted as Pass@1Greedy. As expected, increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in Pass@1 performance across all models, aligning with observations from previous work. For K>1, the Pass@K scores improve for all models as K increases from 1 to 4. SPG achieves the best performance across all settings, with SPG w/ Mixture reaching 55.6% Pass@4 accuracy on MATH500 and 76.6% on Countdown, demonstrating the ability of SPG to generate diverse outputs that can recover the correct solution.

Model: LLaDA-8B-Instruct Question: Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them? Model: LLaDA-8B-Instruct Answer: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost pattern of the glass. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price. Therefore, the cost of every second glass is 0.6 \u00d7 5 = 3 dollars. We can break down the cost as follows: \u2022 The first glass costs $5. \u2022 The second glass costs $3. \u2022 The third glass costs $5. \u2022 The fourth glass costs $3. \u2022 And so on... We can see that the cost alternates between $5 and $3. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need pair them up. The first of each pair costs $5, and the second of each pair costs $3. Therefore, the cost of each pair is 5 + 3 = 8 dollars. Since there are 8 pairs of glasses (16 glasses divided into pairs), the total cost is 8 \u00d7 8 = 64 dollars. </reasoning> <answer> 64 </answer> Question: Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each.

Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left? Model: LLaDA-8B-Instruct Answer: First, let\u2019s determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has. She has two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. She also has three makeup sets with six colors each, 3 \u00d7 6 = 18. So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has is: 8 + 18 = 26. Next, her sister steals one of the palettes, which she loses completely. Therefore, the number of colors left from the remaining palettes is: 8 \u22124 = 4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has six colors, so half of that is: 6 2 = 3. Thus, the number of colors left from the one makeup set is: 6 \u22123 = 3. Adding, the total number of eyes left is: 4 + 3 = 11. </reasoning> <answer> 11 </answer> Model: D1 Question: Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment.

Model: D1 Answer: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost pattern of the glass. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price. Therefore, the cost of every second glass is 5 \u00d7 0.6 = 3 dollars. We can break down the cost into two parts: 1. The cost of the first 8 glasses, each costing $5. 29 2. The cost of the next 8 glasses, each costing $3. First, let\u2019s calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses: 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 dollars. Next, let\u2019s calculate the cost of the next 8 glasses: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 dollars. Now, we add these two amounts together: 40 + 24 = 64 dollars. Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for them. </reasoning> <answer> 64 </answer> Question: Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each.

One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them? Model: WD1 Answer: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost of both the full price and the discounted price glasses. First, let\u2019s calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses, which are sold at the full price of $5 each: 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 dollars. Next, let\u2019s calculate the cost of the next 8 glasses, which are sold at 60% of the full price. Since 60% of $5 is: 0.6 \u00d7 5 = 3 dollars. So, the cost for the next 8 glasses is: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 dollars. Now, we add the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the next 8 glasses: 40 + 24 = 64 dollars.

Model: UniGRPO Answer: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost of both the regular glasses and the discounted glasses. A regular glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of that price, which is 5 \u00d7 0.6 = 3. Since Kylar will buy 16 glasses, he will have 8 regular glasses and 8 discounted glasses. The cost of 8 regular glasses is 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 dollars. The cost of 8 discounted glasses is 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 dollars. Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is 40 + 24 = 64 dollars. </reasoning> <answer> 64 </answer> Question: Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left? Model: UniGRPO Answer: First, let\u2019s determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has. She has two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she has 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. She also has three makeup sets with six colors each, so she has 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. Adding these together gives her initially 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors. Next, her sister steals one of the palettes, so she now has 8 \u22124 = 14 colors from the palettes. She then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since she used one makeup set, containing six colors, she used 6 2 = 3 colors from that set. Therefore, she has 18 \u22123 = 15 colors left from the makeup sets. Finally, adding the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, Amy has 14 + 15 = 29 eyeshadow colors left. </reasoning> <answer> 29 </answer> Model: SPG w/ EUBO Question: Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment.

Model: SPG w/ EUBO Answer: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost structure of the glasses. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. Therefore, the cost of each second glass is 5.0 \u00d7 0.6 = 3.0 dollars. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which means he will have 8 pairs of glasses. Each pair consists of one first glass and one second glass. The cost of one pair is: 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0 dollars. Since there are 8 pairs, the", "5.0 \u00d7 0.6 = 3.0 dollars. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which means he will have 8 pairs of glasses. Each pair consists of one first glass and one second glass.

We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel\u2013Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs\u2019 self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are con- strained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies. \u2217Equal Contribution Corresponding Author Date: Oct 11, 2025 Contact: qgchen@ir.hit.edu.cn, car@ir.hit.edu.cn, lbqin@csu.edu.cn 1. Introduction In recent years, diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have emerged as a novel generative paradigm, attracting increasing research attention [14, 25]. Representative works such as LLaDA [17] and Dream [27] adopt a two-stage mask-denoising training strategy combined with parallel decoding for masked token prediction, effectively mitigating the \u201creversal curse\u201d in traditional autoregressive large language models (ALLMs). Mercury [12] and Fast-DLLM [23] further demonstrate the parallel efficiency of DLLMs, achieving an impressive generation speed in code tasks. Meanwhile, the rapid development of the Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) [9, 3, 4] has spurred increasing research on applying DLLMs to extended reasoning tasks [22, 21]. Zhao et al.

Applying DLLMs to reasoning scenarios reveals an inherent contradiction between parallel processing and sequential reasoning, leading to high entropy, superficial parallel decoding, and limited Long CoT capabilities. [19] employ diffusion-augmented SFT and GRPO to further improve reasoning [8]. Moreover, Trado [22] exploits overlooked information in sampling trajectories, achieving substantial gains. As shown in Figure 1 (a), DLLMs generate text in parallel, producing a few non-sequential words in a single diffusion step. In sequential reasoning scenarios (Figure 1 (b)), the generation of stepi requires the completion of stepi\u22121, leading to lower entropy [5, 1]. In contrast, Figure 1 (c) shows DLLMs to parallel-decode by generating stepi+1 before stepi, resulting in high entropy. Nevertheless, these parallel and sequential processes are inherently contradictory: parallelism involves simultaneous processing, while sequential reasoning requires ordered steps. To address this, we introduce the Parallel\u2013Sequential Contradiction (PSC), which explores the underlying mechanisms and practical implications of diffusion-based reasoning. To investigate this issue systematically, as shown in Figure 1 (d, e), we focus on two central research questions: (1) Do DLLMs truly perform parallel reasoning that avoids PSC? (2) What challenges do DLLMs meet in Long CoT based on PSC? To address the first question, we analyze the decoding behavior of DLLMs in both simple and complex reasoning scenarios. Our findings show that DLLMs fail to achieve genuine parallel reasoning due to the PSC. They perform superficial parallel computation when outputs can be directly produced, but revert to an autoregressive mode under higher reasoning demands. This reliance on autoregression affects computational efficiency, which nearly doubles the computational cost with low confidence remasking. Furthermore, while autoregressive prompting is effective in ALLMs, it conflicts with DLLMs\u2019 parallel decoding design, amplifying the PSC of DLLMs. In contrast, strategies that reduce contradiction, such as conditional prompting or prompts that encourage parallel generation, effectively enhance prompting performance. To understand the second question, we examine the core capabilities of Long CoT in DLLMs. Our analysis reveals that, when faced with PSC, DLLMs often demonstrate limited self-reflection, shallow reasoning depth, and constrained exploratory behavior. Furthermore, we introduce three scaling dimensions for inference 2 time, specifically designed for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential scaling. Our findings show that both diffusion and sequential scaling are significantly constrained by PSC, while the parallel scaling law remains unaffected due to its vertical relationship with PSC. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: \u2022 Identification of Parallel-Sequential Contradictions: To our knowledge, we first identify the Parallel- Sequential Contradiction (PSC) in DLLMs for Long CoT. We demonstrate that PSC leads to superficial parallel reasoning and reduced efficiency, requiring twice the decoding steps. \u2022 Systematic Exploration of DLLM Reasoning Limitation: We conduct a systematic evaluation of DLLM reasoning, identifying the degradation of three core Long", "identify the Parallel- Sequential Contradiction (PSC) in DLLMs for Long CoT.

Our methods include parallel-encouraging prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, which substantially alleviate the constraints imposed by PSC. 2. Parallel-Sequential Contradiction 2.1. Parallel Masked Diffusion Language Models In Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs), inference reconstructs missing spans by predicting masked tokens conditioned on a partially masked input. Its goal is modelling the conditional likelihood p\u03b8(xi 0|xl) for masked positions: \u2212El,x0,xl [\ufe03 L l L \u2211\ufe01 i=1 1[xi l \u2208M] log p\u03b8(xi 0|xl) ]\ufe03 , (1) where L denotes the total number of tokens; l is the number of masked tokens, uniformly sampled from {1, 2, . . . , L}; x0 is the complete original sequence. xl is the partially masked sequence obtained by replacing those l positions in x0 with mask tokens, which serves as the conditional input. The indicator 1[xi l \u2208M] equals 1 if position i is masked and 0 otherwise. 2.2. Sequential Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) allows LLMs to tackle complex problems by generating a sequence of reasoning steps. This method solves a problem P by following an ordered series of steps S1, S2, . . . , Sn, leading to the final answer A. Formally, it can be defined as: p\u03b8(A|P) = n+1 \u220f\ufe01 t=1 p\u03b8(St|P, S<t). (2) Here, Sn+1 = A, meaning the final answer is treated as the last step of the reasoning sequence. When generating each step St, the model computes the conditional probability based on the problem P and all previously generated steps S<t. 2.3. Parallel-Sequential Contradiction For tasks with high parallelism, downstream states typically yield predictable, high-probability outcomes, resulting in low predictive entropy. In these cases, optimizing the conditional probability p\u03b8(Sk | S1) is efficient, making non-autoregressive or semi-parallel generation methods advantageous.

To determine the number of bushels of wheat that Charlotte owns, we will start by finding out how many bushels of wheat Evelyn possesses. Step 1 : Evelyn possesses 310 bushels of wheat (given). Step 2: Since Charlotte possesses 15 times as many bushels as Evelyn , we need to multiply Evelyn 's bushels by 15. 310 times 15 = 4650 Therefore, Charlotte owns 4650 bushels of wheat. To solve the equation $x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0$, we start by examining the quadratic expression: $$x^2 - 2x + 1$$ First, we check if it can be factored directly. The quadratic expression $x^2 - 2x + 1$ might be a perfect square trinomial. To verify this, we use the method of completing the square or checking the discriminant. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 - 2bx + c = 0$ is given by $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. For our equation: $$a = 1, \\quad b = -2, \\quad c = 1$$ The discriminant $\\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 4 - 4 = 0$. Since the discriminant is zero\u2026. Figure 2: Diffusion order analysis with d1 [28] and Trado [22], where later decoding orders are indicated by shallower colors. with strong sequential dependencies exhibit high entropy when predicting distant future states in parallel. This uncertainty leads to significant predictive loss. To reduce this loss, the model is encouraged to break down the generation process into a sequence of low-entropy, step-by-step predictions. As a result, parallel generation conflicts with the model\u2019s objective of identifying a low-loss, high-probability sequential path. The formal proof is provided in Appendix A. 3. Do DLLMs truely perform parallel reasoning that avoids PSC? 3.1. Parallel-Sequential Contradictions cause superficial parallel reasoning. To examine whether DLLMs can genuinely perform parallel reasoning, we analyze their decoding behavior in both simple and complex scenarios. We have two key observations: Parallel-Sequential Contradictions cause superficial parallel reasoning in simple scenarios. As shown in Figure 2 (a, b), DLLMs demonstrate parallel reasoning in simple cases where the model can direct output results without reasoning. For instance, when solving \"x2 + 2x + 1 = 0\", the model may simultaneously generate the Quadratic Formula \"\u2206= b2 \u22124ac\" and the final solution \"x = \u22121\" within a few diffusion steps. Following this, DLLMs complete the remaining reasoning steps in parallel, demonstrating the ability to leverage diffusion-based decoding to arrive at direct solutions without relying heavily on sequential reasoning. To further explore this, we analyze the distribution of answers generated in the initial diffusion steps. As shown in Figure 2 (e), over 47% of answers are produced within the first 30% of diffusion steps. This suggests that in simple scenarios, DLLMs are capable of performing parallel reasoning, even though the underlying thought process, such as", "the distribution of answers generated in the initial diffusion steps. As shown in Figure 2 (e), over 47% of answers are produced within the first 30% of diffusion steps. This suggests that in simple scenarios, DLLMs are capable of performing parallel reasoning, even though the underlying thought process, such as applying the Quadratic Formula before deriving the result, is inherently sequential. For complex reasoning, DLLMs converge toward autoregressive-like behavior to avoid PSC. To examine DLLM behavior in complex reasoning tasks, we validate PSC where the model cannot directly output the correct answer. Figure 2 (c, d) shows that DLLMs increasingly resemble autoregressive models. For example, when addressing tasks beyond direct generation, the model defaults to an autoregressive process. This suggests difficulty in sustaining parallel reasoning, which shifts to step-by-step processing. Figure 2 (f) 4 (a) The impact of diffusion/decoding steps and generated token length.

These findings indicate that DLLMs face inherent PSC challenges in balancing parallel generation with sequential reasoning, ultimately converging toward autoregressive-like processing in complex scenarios. 3.2. Diffusion-Step Dilemma: Sacrificing Efficiency Under PSC To investigate the reasoning efficiency of current DLLMs, we systematically categorize questions in BigGSM [3] into different sampling lengths and diffusion steps (with low-confidence remasking). We evaluate two representative DLLMs under exponentially increasing diffusion steps and max token lengths (ranging from 1 to 1024). See Appendix B for more details. When complex reasoning, DLLMs require significantly more diffusion steps than ALLMs. As shown in Figure 3 (a), achieving comparable length and accuracy to ALLMs demands over 25% more diffusion or decoding steps with remasking. In extreme cases, DLLMs require up to twice the token length in diffusion steps to match the performance and output length of autoregressive models when generating over 256 tokens. It indicates that effective reasoning entails roughly double the diffusion steps relative", "over 25% more diffusion or decoding steps with remasking. In extreme cases, DLLMs require up to twice the token length in diffusion steps to match the performance and output length of autoregressive models when generating over 256 tokens. It indicates that effective reasoning entails roughly double the diffusion steps relative to the answer length, underscoring a notable efficiency challenge in reasoning tasks. In reasoning scenarios, a large number of diffusion steps for autoregressive reasoning is unavoidable for acceptable accuracy. Each generated token requires a sufficient number of diffusion iterations to allow the model to reason effectively and produce high-quality outputs. As illustrated in Figure 3 (b), performance sharply declines when diffusion steps fall below the target token length. For example, generating 80 tokens with a maximum length of 128 but only 64 diffusion steps results in over a 10% accuracy drop; with 32 steps, accuracy decreases by about 40%. This demonstrates that inadequate diffusion severely impairs reasoning, as the model lacks enough refinement iterations. Thus, diffusion steps should at least match the planned token length to maintain reasoning quality. Nonetheless, excessive diffusion can significantly reduce efficiency. 3.3. Rethinking the prompting strategies in DLLMs from PSC perspective In general, traditional autoregressive inference methods are typically categorized into two types: pipeline- guided approaches and condition-following approaches (see Appendix D for further details). In this section, we will begin by reviewing the theoretical foundations and representative implementations of these two categories. We will then examine their practical limitations and challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a parallel-encouraging prompting to improve DLLM effectiveness. 5 Model Name BigGSM (Acc.) GSM8K (Acc.) Math-500 (Acc.)

Sequential Reasoning Prompting will enlarge PSC\u2019s negative impact for DLLMs. Sequential prompting strategies, which facilitate sequential reasoning, have been shown to significantly improve the performance of ALLMs on complex tasks. However, as indicated in purple rows of Table 1, we observed a notable decline in performance as tasks required an increasing number of reasoning steps. We attribute this decline to the fact that sequential reasoning prompts exacerbate the negative impact of PSC, thereby impairing the reasoning performance in DLLMs. Constraint-guided Reasoning Prompting enhances model performance by preventing the introduction of additional PSC. By incorporating explicit constraints into the reasoning process, constraint-guided prompting effectively narrows the model\u2019s search space, thereby preventing the emergence of additional PSC during the reasoning process in DLLMs. This focused approach results in more accurate and reliable solutions. As shown blue rows of in Table 1, methods based on this principle, such as Complex-CoT [6] and MARP [3], demonstrate superior reasoning capabilities in DLLMs compared to traditional sequential prompting methods. 6 Parallel-encouraging Prompting reduces the sequential feature so that it further improves performance. Parallel-encouraging prompting refers to the technique of presenting multiple related tasks or questions simultaneously. This approach reduces the impact of PSC and minimizes the sequential features in the prompting process. By encouraging the model to make connections across these tasks, as illustrated in green rows of Table 1, it effectively fosters DLLMs\u2019 performance, leading to more efficient reasoning and information integration. Leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of DLLMs, this method has the potential to significantly enhance performance, particularly in complex reasoning tasks, by promoting more comprehensive and coherent solutions. Takeaways 1. Due to PSC, DLLMs engage in superficial parallel reasoning and exhibit autoregressive behavior in complex scenarios, which compromises their reasoning efficiency. 2. Sequential prompts prove ineffective for DLLMs, requiring PSC-free or -redcued approaches like constraint-guided and parallel-encouraging prompts to guide their operation. 4. What challenges do DLLMs meet in Long CoT based on PSC? Despite impressive empirical results, DLLMs\u2019 genuine reasoning abilities and scalability under Parallel- Sequential Contradictions remain open questions. We systematically evaluate Long CoT to assess these fundamental capabilities and scaling strategies. 4.1. DLLMs do not have sufficient basic capabilities to support Long CoT. Long CoT is the primary innovation in recent reasoning large", "empirical results, DLLMs\u2019 genuine reasoning abilities and scalability under Parallel- Sequential Contradictions remain open questions. We systematically evaluate Long CoT to assess these fundamental capabilities and scaling strategies. 4.1. DLLMs do not have sufficient basic capabilities to support Long CoT. Long CoT is the primary innovation in recent reasoning large language models, leveraging inference-time scaling for self-exploration, self-reflection, and deep reasoning [4]. Evaluation details are in Appendix E. Traditional reflection strategies are Ineffective for DLLMs. Long CoT models always employ a self- reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. To assess its efficacy, we examine two LLM paradigms: (1) Prompting Reflection and (2) Autoregressive Forcing Reflection As shown in Figure 4 (a, b), reflection paradigms yield no significant differences from vanilla reasoning chains in semantic similarity, informative- ness, or token-level entropy. Though the reflection process increases entropy and reduces informativeness, it maintains over 0.95 semantic similarity to original reasoning chains. These findings suggest the reflection mechanism offers only limited surface-level optimization. Figure 4 (c) further reveals a substantial token repetition ratio compared to the original path, resulting in approximately 10% reflection-to-error responses. Limited Efficacy of traditional exploration strategies for novel reasoning path generation. Exploration, a fundamental competency for complex reasoning, involves a model\u2019s ability to generate diverse and innovative solutions. To assess this potential in DLLMs, we designed experiments utilizing two strategies: (1) Prompting Exploration and (2) Autoregressive Forcing Exploration. Figure 5 (a, b) reveal that current exploration strategies offer several improvements in the novel semantic of generated reasoning processes. However, these improvements remain superficial, evidenced by a high similarity (> 0.84) between explored paths and original results. Furthermore, as depicted in Figure 5 (c), while the new path and explore-to-correct ratios are limited (\u223c5%), they nonetheless indicate a positive, albeit constrained, effect. DLLMs possess limited reasoning boundaries and, consequently, exhibit restricted deep reasoning abilities. To examine the limitations of DLLMs on deep reasoning, we evaluate their capacity to sustain reasoning across sufficient depths. Figure 6 (a) demonstrates that error steps are all less than 2, which suggests that current DLLMs are unable to consistently sustain deep reasoning performance.

[3], we define the 90% correctness step count as the models\u2019 completely feasible reasoning boundary (CFRB), and the 10% correctness step count as the completely infeasible reasoning boundary (CIRB). As shown in Figure 6 (b), current DLLMs display similar CFRB values but lower CIRB values, indicating narrower feasible reasoning ranges. 4.2. Current DLLMs have three-directional but limited Inference-Time Scaling Given their denoising characteristics, we investigate a fundamental question: Is there also Inference- Time Scaling Law in DLLM under such contradictions? We examine this through three complementary perspectives: Parallel Scaling, Diffusion Scaling, and Sequential Scaling. These experiments determine whether DLLMs follow inference-time scaling laws and provide practical insights for optimizing reasoning performance. Implementation details can be seen in Appendix F. 4.2.1. Parallel Scaling Law holds Despite PSC For DLLMs, a key question is whether their unique diffusion generation mechanism supports efficient parallel sampling and whether parallel sampling can effectively enhance reasoning performance. 8 Qwen-7B-Instruct Dream-7B-Instruct LLaMA3-8B-Instruct LLaDA-8B-Instruct (a) The first incorrect step position across 4 models on BigGSM.

Parallel Scaling Size (log scale) Figure 8: Performance analysis under Parallel Scaling. Higher temperatures do not always yield more diverse and effective parallel sampling. The decoding temperature controls generation randomness, with higher values typically increasing output diversity in ALLM reasoning. We adjust the temperature during generation (0.1 to 1.0) to evaluate its impact on parallel sampling. Model accuracy improves steadily with increasing Pass@k values across all temperature settings before plateauing. As shown in Figure 8 (a), moderate temperatures (e.g., T = 0.5) achieve optimal performance, while both lower and higher temperatures yield diminished performance gains. This indicates that moderate temperature settings provide the optimal balance between generation diversity and output reliability. DLLM reasoning accuracy improves with increased parallel samples, following inference-time scaling patterns. As shown in Figure 8 (b), when k increases from 1 to 32, accuracy demonstrates nearly linear improvement on a logarithmic scale. This indicates that DLLMs effectively utilize parallel sampling to enhance reasoning performance, as diverse outputs increase the probability of generating correct solutions. This pattern aligns with inference-time scaling laws observed in other advanced language models, where performance scales with computational effort during inference. 9 Accuracy (%) 30 35 40 45 50 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 Accuracy (%) Diffusion Steps (c) Diffusion and Sequential Scaling Performance on LLaDA-Instruct-8B.

Diffusion Step Accuracy (%) Figure 9: Diffusion Scaling analysis of reasoning accuracy across difficulty levels on BigGSM. 4.2.2. Diffusion Scaling Law is Broken and Constrained by PSC Diffusion Scaling of DLLMs ensures performance gains, with diffusion time positively correlated. Model accuracy increases monotonically with the number of diffusion steps. We are the first to formalize Diffusion Scaling in DLLMs, proposing a positive correlation between model performance and diffusion iterations. To validate this claim, we benchmark two representative DLLMs, DREAM [27] and LLaDA [16], under an exponential schedule of diffusion steps (1\u20131024). By tracking accuracy at each step, we observe how DLLMs address reasoning tasks of varying complexity across the diffusion process. As shown in Figure 9 (a), performance consistently improves with deeper diffusion; however, the rate of improvement depends on task difficulty: simpler problems gain substantially, while tasks beyond the model\u2019s capacity yield only limited benefits. Diffusion Scaling is effective and exhibits an upper bound, beyond which an over-diffusion phenomenon emerges due to PSC. Consistent with classical scaling laws, the benefits of diffusion scaling are inherently capped. As shown in Figure 9 (a), increasing diffusion steps improves performance from 32 to 512 steps, after which gains plateau. More importantly, excessive diffusion reduces accuracy: Figure 9 (b) shows a drop from 44.92% to 44.43%. This decline illustrates over-diffusion, where extended denoising introduces excessive corrections that disrupt reasoning chains, akin to overfitting caused by training without early stopping. Early stopping can effectively mitigate over-diffusion. To address over-diffusion, we propose a Diffusion Early Stopping (DES) strategy that halts the process when generated tokens stabilize. The implementation comprises three components: (1) Overlap Ratio Calculation: computed as the proportion of identical tokens between consecutive steps. (2) Convergence Detection: potential convergence occurs when the overlap ratio meets or exceeds a predefined threshold. (3) Activation Condition: early stopping triggers only after three consecutive steps satisfy the threshold, preventing false positives from transient fluctuations. As shown in Figure 9 (b), we observe that beyond 256 steps, early stopping outperforms standard diffusion, with accuracy improving from 44.26% to 46.89% at 1024 steps. Early stopping captures convergence states and terminates upon stabilization, while preventing performance degradation from excessive diffusion. 4.2.3. Sequential Scaling Law is also Broken and Constrained by PSC The inherent limitations of sequential scaling for DLLMs. While sequential scaling has shown promise in enhancing reasoning capabilities, it remains constrained by the inherent characteristics of DLLMs. As 10 shown in Figure 9 (d), the performance improvements are at first increasing but eventually converge. This limitation arises from the fact that sequential scaling relies on the model\u2019s ability to maintain context over extended reasoning chains, a challenge for current DLLMs. Sequential Scaling also meets over-thinking challenges. Similar to diffusion scaling, as shown in Figure 9 (d), sequential scaling faces its own set of over-thinking challenges. As the model attempts to extend its reasoning across longer contexts, it may encounter diminishing returns or even performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in tasks that require intricate reasoning over extended text, where the model\u2019s ability to track and", "sequential scaling faces its own set of over-thinking challenges. As the model attempts to extend its reasoning across longer contexts, it may encounter diminishing returns or even performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in tasks that require intricate reasoning over extended text, where the model\u2019s ability to track and integrate information can become strained. Diffusion Scaling can naturally yield Sequential Scaling benefits. As shown in Figure 9 (e), diffusion scaling alleviates the limitations of sequential scaling. We identify three stages in DLLMs during diffusion: (1) sequential scaling, (2) compression, and (3) convergence. In the first stage, increasing diffusion steps leads to stable performance but longer solutions, indicating that DLLMs explore suitable lengths for reasoning. In the second stage, the model compresses its reasoning by eliminating redundancy, generating more efficient solutions. In the third stage, the model converges on an optimal strategy, achieving high performance while reducing computational cost. Takeaways 1. DLLMs are deficient in three basic Long CoT capabilities, hindering their effectiveness. 2. DLLM can be optimized via parallel, diffusion, and sequential scaling. Diffusion scaling inherently encompasses the benefits of sequential scaling. 3. The performance of both diffusion and sequential scaling is ultimately upper-bounded by a parallel- sequential contradiction. But Parallel scaling law remains the most effective strategy, although it is also the most computationally expensive. 5. Related work The application of diffusion models to text generation has emerged as an alternative to autoregressive methods. Early work by D3PM [2] proposed discrete denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and Diffusion-BERT [10] demonstrated scalability to BERT-style architectures. SEDD [15] achieved performance comparable to GPT-2. Recent progress has broadened the scope of Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) [25, 23, 8]. LLaDA [16] and Dream [27] scaled to billion-parameter models with notable inference gains. The D2F strategy [21] further enhanced inference by enabling block-level autoregression and parallel decoding, maintaining a balance between speed and accuracy. This direction aligns with the growing interest in applying DLLMs to extended reasoning [22, 28]. Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT) [26] combines diffusion with chain-of-thought reasoning. Building on this, Zhao et al. [28] and Tang et al. [19] applied diffusion- augmented SFT and GRPO to strengthen reasoning. Similarly, Trado [22] exploits overlooked sampling signals, yielding further reasoning gains. However, while DLLMs exhibit notable parallel decoding in text generation and consistently strong step- by-step reasoning, these features appear conceptually opposed: parallelism implies simultaneous processing, whereas sequential reasoning demands ordered progression. This apparent Parallel\u2013Sequential Contradiction (PSC) suggests that both the underlying mechanisms and the practical effectiveness of DLLMs\u2019 diffusion-based reasoning remain insufficiently understood. 11 6. Conclusion In this work, we formalize the Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC) to explain why DLLMs, though built for parallel decoding, revert to autoregression as reasoning difficulty rises. Empirically, DLLMs exploit parallelism only when tokens are locally decidable; otherwise, they fall back to sequential computation, reducing efficiency. Further, we first define three-dimensional scaling: parallel, diffusion, and sequential scaling, and show that PSC restricts the latter two while parallel scaling holds. We mitigate PSC through parallel-focused prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, improving both accuracy and throughput. Future work should align training and", "sequential computation, reducing efficiency.

We rigorously show, via information theory and optimization, that the intrinsic statistical property of a generative task, namely its sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions, fundamentally determines its optimal (lowest-loss) generation strategy. Concretely, we axiomatize two classes of tasks: serial tasks (step-by-step reasoning) exhibiting cascading sensitivity to initial conditions, and parallel tasks exhibiting partial invariance, and we prove that serial tasks induce significantly higher conditional entropy for \u201cskip- step\u201d parallel predictions Sk | S1 than parallel tasks, forcing any loss-minimizing learner to converge to an autoregressive strategy. A.1. Problem Setup and Notation Let all step states Si take values in a metric space (\u2126, d). Specifically, the true data distribution pS \u03b8 of a task is considered serial if, for any given s1 \u2208\u2126, the mapping from s\u2032 1 to a subsequent state s\u2032 k is highly divergent within a sufficiently small neighborhood N(s1, \u03f5) = {s\u2032 1|d(s1, s\u2032 1) < \u03f5}. Conversely, a task\u2019s true data distribution pP \u03b8 is considered parallel if, for any given s1 \u2208\u2126, there exists at least one subsequent state Sk (where k>1) that is insensitive to perturbations within its neighborhood N(s1, \u03f5). Formally, this leads to the following definitions for the two tasks. Definition 1 (Serial tasks: cascading sensitivity). A data-generating distribution pS \u03b8 is serial if for any s1 \u2208\u2126 and any k > 1, that satisfies: lim \u03b5\u21920 Es\u2032 1\u223cU(N(s1,\u03b5)) [\ufe00 pS \u03b8(Sk = sk | S1 = s\u2032 1) ]\ufe00= 0, (3) where sk is the reference outcome drawn from the true conditional pS \u03b8(Sk | S1 = s1), and U(N(s1, \u03b5)) the uniform distribution over this neighborhood. Equivalently, arbitrarily small perturbations of S1 almost surely drive future states away from the reference trajectory at step k, capturing sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Definition 2 (Parallel tasks: partial invariance). A data-generating distribution pP \u03b8 is parallel if there exists some k > 1 and a constant C \u2208(0, 1] such that for any s1 \u2208\u2126, that satisfies: lim \u03b5\u21920 Es\u2032 1\u223cU(N(s1,\u03b5)) [\ufe00 pP \u03b8 (Sk = sk | S1 = s\u2032 1) ]\ufe00= C \u2208(0, 1], (4) where sk is the reference outcome drawn from pP \u03b8 (Sk | S1 = s1). Thus, a structurally stable downstream state persists with significant probability despite infinitesimal perturbations of the initial condition. A.2. Learning problem Let p\u03b8 be a parametric generative model trained by minimizing cross-entropy with respect to the true data distribution \u02c6p, i.e., L(p\u03b8, \u02c6p) = Ex\u223c\u02c6p[\u2212log p\u03b8(x)] = H( \u02c6p) + DKL( \u02c6p\u2225p\u03b8), (5) so minimizing cross-entropy is equivalent to minimizing DKL( \u02c6p\u2225p\u03b8) and to maximum likelihood. For any conditional subproblem, the optimum satisfies p\u2217 \u03b8(Sk | S1) = \u02c6p(Sk | S1), and the minimal expected negative log-likelihood equals the conditional entropy, L\u2217= Es1\u223c\u02c6p(S1) [\ufe01 H (\ufe00\u02c6p(Sk | S1 = s1) )\ufe00]\ufe01 , where H(Y | X) \u2261\u2212 \u2211\ufe01 x\u2208X,y\u2208Y p(x, y) log p(x, y) p(x) .

(6) 15 Autoregression and chain rule. A step-by-step reaosning strategy factorizes a joint distribution as a product of conditionals via the chain rule, thereby replacing a high-entropy \u201cskip\u201d conditional p\u03b8(Sk | S1) by a sequence of typically lower-entropy one-step conditionals p\u03b8(St+1 | St, . . .). It is the standard rationale behind likelihood-based training of ALLMs under teacher forcing. A.3. Discretization To compare entropies on a general metric space, consider a finite measurable partition \u03a0\u03b5 of \u2126with mesh size at most \u03b5, and define the discretization and quantization map \u03d5\u03b5 : \u2126\u2192[m\u03b5] that assigns each s \u2208\u2126to its cell index, where m\u03b5 = |\u03a0\u03b5|. Let \u02dcS(\u03b5) i = \u03d5\u03b5(Si) and write p(\u03b5) \u03b8 (\u00b7) for the induced discrete laws; we analyze H( \u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u02dcs1), which is well-defined, and relate back to the original problem by taking \u03b5 \u21920. Two standard facts underpin the analysis: (i) for a fixed finite support, entropy is maximized by the uniform distribution; (ii) the Shannon entropy is bounded below by the min-entropy \u2212log pmax, and admits tighter lower bounds in terms of the binary entropy function Hb and the support size. Lemma 1 (Pointwise probability caps). Fix k > 1 and s1 \u2208\u2126. Under Definition 1, for any \u03b4 > 0 there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that for all \u03b5 < \u03b50, max s\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) p(\u03b5) \u03b8,S (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k = sk | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s\u2032 1) )\ufe00\u2264\u03b4, (7) where s\u2032 1 \u223cN\u2032(s1) \u21d4\u03b5(s1) \u0338= \u03b5(s\u2032 1) \u2227\u03b5(s\u2032 1) \u2208m\u03b5. Under Definition 2, there exist C > 0 and \u03b50 > 0 such that for all \u03b5 < \u03b50, max s\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k = sk | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s\u2032 1) )\ufe00\u2265C. (8) Proof sketch. By Definition 1, for serial tasks, the conditional probability of a reference outcome, averaged over shrinking neighborhoods of s\u2032 1, vanishes. This forces any mass that could be concentrated on a particular cell containing sk to diminish as the mesh refines. In contrast, for parallel tasks, Definition 2 guarantees a persistent mass C \u2208(0, 1] associated with a stable outcome across neighborhoods, which uniformly lower-bounds the maximum conditional atom in \u03b5. A.4. Main proposition and quantitative bounds Proposition 1 (Skip-step parallel predictions on serial vs. parallel tasks). For any k > 1, the optimal expected skip-prediction loss on serial-task data strictly exceeds that on parallel-task data: L\u2217 S (\ufe00 p\u03b8(Sk | S1 = s\u2032 1) )\ufe00> L\u2217 P (\ufe00 p\u03b8(Sk | S1 = s\u2032 1) )\ufe00 , (9) equivalently, Es\u2032 1\u223cU(N(s1,\u03b5)) [\ufe00 HS (\ufe00 Sk | S1 = s\u2032 1 )\ufe00]\ufe00> Es\u2032 1\u223cU(N(s1,\u03b5)) [\ufe00 HP (\ufe00 Sk | S1 = s\u2032 1 )\ufe00]\ufe00 , (10) In the discrete case, this reduces to showing Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HS (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00> Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HP (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00 (11) with a strictly positive gap", "[\ufe00 HP (\ufe00 Sk | S1 = s\u2032 1 )\ufe00]\ufe00 , (10) In the discrete case, this reduces to showing Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HS (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00> Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HP (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00 (11) with a strictly positive gap that can be quantified through discretization and classical entropy bounds. 16 Proof. It suffices to compare the conditional entropies pointwise and then take expectations. Fix s1 and a partition \u03a0\u03b5. We first define the maximum of generation probability of serial tasks: pS max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) := max s\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) p(\u03b5) \u03b8,S (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k = sk | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s\u2032 1) )\ufe00 (12) and analogously pP max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) under p(\u03b5) \u03b8,P. By the lemma, pS max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) \u21920 as \u03b5 \u21920, while for parallel tasks one has pP max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) \u2265C for all sufficiently small \u03b5. For any discrete distribution over m\u03b5 points with maximal atom pmax, Fano\u2019s inequality implies H \u2264Hb(pmax) + (1 \u2212pmax) log(m\u03b5 \u22121), (13) where Hb is the binary entropy. Thus, for parallel tasks, HP (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s\u2032 1) )\ufe00\u2264Hb (\ufe00 pP max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) )\ufe00+ (\ufe00 1 \u2212pP max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) )\ufe00 log(m\u03b5 \u22121), (14) and since pP max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) \u2265C > 0, the entropy is uniformly bounded away from the maximal value log(m\u03b5) by a constant determined by C. For serial tasks, since pS max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) \u21920, we have error probability pe \u21920. Now, we should apply the contrapositive of Fano\u2019s inequality. Specifically, given the Fano\u2019s inequality: H \u2264Hb(pe) + pe log(m\u03b5 \u22121), (15) it follows that H \u21920 \u21d2pe \u21920. Conversely, pe \u21921 implies H \u2192Hmax. In this sense, the condition is satisfied: HP (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s\u2032 1) )\ufe00\u2192log(m\u03b5 \u22121), if pS max(\u03b5; s\u2032 1) \u21920, (16) which reflects the extreme dispersion dictated by sensitivity. Therefore, it satisfies: Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HS (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00\u2212Es\u2032 1\u223cN\u2032(s1) [\ufe00 HP (\ufe00\u02dcS(\u03b5) k | \u02dcS(\u03b5) 1 = \u03d5\u03b5(s1) )\ufe00]\ufe00\u2192strictly positive. (17) Q.E.D. \u25a1 A.5. Consequences for optimal strategy Because the minimum achievable expected NLL equals the conditional entropy, the high conditional entropy of skip-step predictions in serial tasks implies a high irreducible loss for any p\u03b8(Sk | S1) objective. A loss-minimizing learner therefore prefers factorizing the prediction into a chain of low-entropy one-step conditionals, i.e., an autoregressive strategy, which aligns with the chain rule factorization and standard maximum-likelihood training. By contrast, in parallel tasks, the existence of a stable high-probability outcome for some downstream state Sk produces a low-entropy, high-confidence conditional, so optimizing p\u03b8(Sk | S1) can be preferable and can support non-autoregressive or partially parallel generation plans. Takeaway. Task-intrinsic sensitivity versus invariance dictates the shape of the optimal conditional distri- butions; via the cross-entropy/KL equivalence, this in turn selects the generation procedure that globally minimizes expected loss, with serial tasks forcing autoregression and parallel tasks permitting advantageous skip-step or parallel predictions. 17 (a) Decoding order in no-reasoning tasks of LLaDA.

B. Diffusion-Step Evaluation Details In this section, we provide additional technical details on the methodology used to evaluate the impact of diffusion steps and sampling lengths in Diffusion-based Language Models (DLLMs). We specifically focus on how these parameters influence the efficiency and accuracy of the models when tackling complex reasoning tasks. For our analysis, we utilize the BigGSM dataset [3], which includes a diverse range of complex reasoning tasks designed to test current models\u2019 ability to perform long-form reasoning. In particular, we assess the performance of two representative DLLMs on these tasks and compare them against a standard ALLM. We systematically vary both the number of diffusion steps and the sampling lengths to evaluate their combined effects on the reasoning efficiency of DLLMs. The number of diffusion steps tested ranges from", "we assess the performance of two representative DLLMs on these tasks and compare them against a standard ALLM. We systematically vary both the number of diffusion steps and the sampling lengths to evaluate their combined effects on the reasoning efficiency of DLLMs. The number of diffusion steps tested ranges from 1 to 1024, while the maximum token lengths vary from 1 to 1024 tokens, with low-confidence remasking. In each experiment, the number of diffusion steps is set equal to the maximum token length. This range allows us to assess the model\u2019s performance under different levels of token generation and diffusion refinement. For ALLMs, we adjust the maximum token length between 1 and 1024 and the temperature between 0.2 and 0.7, aiming to achieve comparable performance to that of the DLLMs. For each setting, we track the following metrics: \u2022 Accuracy: The percentage of correct answers generated by the model. \u2022 Model Output Length: The number of tokens generated by the model before reaching the stopping token (calculated using the GPT-4O tokenizer). When the maximum token length is less than or equal to 512, the model output length typically constitutes 50% to 80% of the maximum token length. Specifically, when generating a maximum token length of 512, achieving optimal performance requires 512 diffusion steps combined with low-confidence remasking strategies. We utilize this remasking approach to ensure the best performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that the efficiency of DLLMs in reasoning tasks is strongly influenced by the balance between diffusion steps and sampling lengths. While a higher number of diffusion steps generally improves reasoning accuracy, it increases computational requirements. Thus, while sufficient diffusion steps are essential for effective reasoning, an excessive number can significantly reduce processing efficiency. 18 C. Early-Stop Strategy The early stopping mechanism is based on the dynamic stability of tokens, which monitors the variation of the newly updated tokens during the diffusion process to judge whether the generation has converged. We calculate the overlap ratio between the current step\u2019s selected tokens (current_tokens) and the previous step\u2019s tokens (prev_tokens) in each diffusion step. When the overlap ratio of the selected tokens remains stable over three consecutive steps and exceeds a threshold \u03b8 = 0.99, early stopping is triggered. The overlap ratio is calculated as: overlap_ratio = 1 N N \u2211\ufe01 j=1 I(current_tokensj = prev_tokensj), (18) where N is the number of tokens updated in the current step, and I is the indicator function. This mechanism is controlled by the parameter early_stop_threshold = 0.99, which controls the sensitivity.The higher the threshold, the more stable the token sequence needs to be before triggering early stopping. The parameter settings use a block-based diffusion strategy: the total generation length of 512 tokens is divided into blocks of length block_length = 32. Temperature = 0.7 helps balance exploration and ex- ploitation. We choose low_confidence strategy, which updates tokens with low confidence. This combination ensures the quality of the generated text while improving efficiency by using fewer diffusion steps, which typically converge to a value smaller than the maximum 512 steps. D.

This combination ensures the quality of the generated text while improving efficiency by using fewer diffusion steps, which typically converge to a value smaller than the maximum 512 steps. D. Prompting Experiment Details D.1. Experimental Setup In this study, we employ the following models: Dream-7B-Instruct [27], LLaDA-8B-Instruct [17], LLaDA- v1.5 [30], and LLaDOU-Math [11]. To optimize performance, we experiment with a temperature range of [0, 1], choose top-p=0.95 and block-length=32, and select the maximum token length from the set {128, 256, 512}, as well as the diffusion step from {128, 256, 512}. For each model, we use the default decoding settings. Additionally, we apply low-confidence remasking to explore the scaling behavior. All experiments conduct on a single A100 or A800 80G GPU. D.2. Sequential Reasoning Prompting These methods were originally designed primarily for Autoregressive Large Language Models (ALLMs) and have played a key role in optimizing their reasoning capabilities: \u2022 Least-to-Most [29]: In autoregressive models, this method systematically breaks down complex problems into multiple simpler sub-problems, guiding the model to reason step by step rather than attempting to solve the entire complex problem at once. This effectively reduces the complexity of single-step generation and enhances the model\u2019s ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. \u2022 Zero-CoT [13]: This strategy uses a simple natural language instruction (e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d) to activate the inherent sequential reasoning ability of autoregressive models, enabling them to generate logically coherent reasoning chains without the need for examples. This not only lowers the barrier to prompt design but also significantly improves the zero-shot reasoning performance, enhancing both the efficiency and generality of reasoning. 19 \u2022 Plan-and-Solve [20]: By clearly dividing the reasoning process into a planning phase and a detailed execution phase, this strategy helps autoregressive models first construct a solution framework and then fill in specific content. This enhances the structural integrity and global consistency of the solution, proving particularly effective for tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning and long-range dependency modeling. Together, these strategies strengthen the sequential reasoning ability of autoregressive models, guiding them through prompt design to generate continuous and logically sound reasoning paths in a more systematic and reliable manner. However, we found that these strategies are not suitable for DLLMs. D.3. Constraint-guided Reasoning Prompting Complex-CoT: The original version of Complex-CoT [6] leverages a few-shot reasoning technique to prompt LLMs into performing more sophisticated reasoning processes. This approach enhances the model\u2019s ability to handle tasks that require a series of logical inferences or multi-step reasoning, thereby improving the overall performance on complex questions. Specifically, by providing a few-shot example that demonstrates how to perform intricate reasoning, the model learns to apply similar patterns to new, unseen problems. In contrast, the Constrained-Guided Version of Complex-CoT introduces a crucial modification to meet specific requirements. Rather than using few-shot examples, we reframe the prompting method as instruction- based, zero-shot constraints created by human experts. These constraints guide the model\u2019s reasoning process without the need for training on a set of example problems. To implement", "Version of Complex-CoT introduces a crucial modification to meet specific requirements. Rather than using few-shot examples, we reframe the prompting method as instruction- based, zero-shot constraints created by human experts. These constraints guide the model\u2019s reasoning process without the need for training on a set of example problems. To implement this approach, the following prompting structure is used to ensure that the model approaches each question with the necessary depth and detail: Complex-CoT (Constrained-Guided Version) You should think about the following question as thoroughly and in as much detail as possible. Question: {question} MARP: The original MARP [3] employs an instruction-based, in-context-learning approach to guide LLMs in structuring and constraining each step of the reasoning process. This method decomposes complex problems into manageable components by promoting multi-step reasoning, while ensuring each step is focused and achievable. By constraining reasoning at each stage, MARP prevents overgeneralization and ensures logical, organized outputs. To meet the requirements of the Constrained-Guided Version, we modify MARP in two ways: first, by organizing reasoning into discrete steps, and second, by enabling parallel processing within each step. This approach allows the model to perform multiple operations simultaneously without compromising clarity or precision. The key concept is to balance step-by-step reasoning with parallel processing, enhancing task efficiency. Each reasoning step involves multiple basic operations, ensuring clarity and minimizing computational overhead. The following prompt structure is used to guide the model\u2019s reasoning process: 20 MARP (Constrained-Guided Version) Reason step by step, but process operations in parallel. \u2022 At each step, you may perform multiple simple operations (up to 5). \u2022 Each operation must remain basic and not involve excessive complexity. \u2022 If you choose to perform more operations in a single step, then each operation must be correspond- ingly smaller in scope. Question: {question} D.4. Parallel-encouraging Prompting This parallel-encouraging strategy is essential for reducing PSC in reasoning. To adapt MARP for DLLM, we enable the model to process multiple operations concurrently, avoiding the bottleneck of sequential processing, where each step depends on the completion of the previous one. This parallel processing speeds up reasoning and enhances scalability. At the same time, operational complexity constraints ensure the reasoning process remains clear and manageable. This method balances parallel execution with simplicity, allowing for effective multi-step reasoning without overwhelming the model with overly complex tasks. Moreover, the model adjusts operation complexity dynamically. When tasked with more operations in a given step, each operation must be simpler, preventing cognitive overload and helping the model stay focused on individual tasks. Ultimately, this approach enables the model to execute parallel reasoning efficiently while maintaining clarity and precision. The detailed prompting for implementation is as follows: Diff-MARP Reasoning in parallel. In each step, do as many basic operations as you can, up to 5. Any single operation cannot be too complex. If you use more operations in a step, the maximum allowed size for any operation decreases. Question: {question} E. DLLM\u2019s Limited Capabilities of Long CoT Reasoning E.1. Long Chain-of-Thought Capabilities Following Chen et al. [4], the Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning capabilities comprise three linked components: deep", "be too complex. If you use more operations in a step, the maximum allowed size for any operation decreases. Question: {question} E. DLLM\u2019s Limited Capabilities of Long CoT Reasoning E.1. Long Chain-of-Thought Capabilities Following Chen et al. [4], the Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning capabilities comprise three linked components: deep reasoning, exploration, and reflection. Deep Reasoning. Given si as the i-th reasoning step, Deep reasoning models the conditional probability p\u03b8(s0, s1, . . . , sK|s0), facilitating multi-step logical inference through iterative refinement. The associated reverse process can be characterized by a factorization: p\u03b8(s0, s1, . . . , sK|s0) = K \u220f\ufe01 i=0 p\u03b8(si+1|si). (19) Exploration. Exploration stems from the probabilistic nature of the reverse process. At each exploration step sj, multiple samples sk j can be drawn from the conditional distribution p\u03b8(sj|si, i < j), enabling the 21 model to explore diverse plausible continuations or solutions. This is formalized as: sk j \u223cp\u03b8(sj|si, i < j), k = 1, . . . , K, (20) where K controls the breadth of exploration. This sampling diversity enhances robustness by covering multiple reasoning paths and mitigating premature convergence to suboptimal outputs. Reflection. We view reflection as a self-correction mechanism arising from iterative conditioning on latent states. At each reverse step, the model revises its belief about the target sequence using the immediately previous state and, via the accumulated latent trajectory, all prior estimates. Formally, this corresponds to implicit message passing: \u02c6sj \u223cp\u03b8(sj|si, i \u2265j), (21) where \u02c6sj denotes the corrected state at step j, enabling iterative error correction and refinement. Together, these components yield a procedure that combines structured logics with stochastic exploration and continual self-correction, enabling effective reasoning on complex multi-step tasks. E.2. Stategies for Self-Reflection and Self-Exploration experiments on DLLMs To investigate whether DLLMs truly possess the fundamental capabilities for Long CoT Reasoning, we designed two sets of experiments: self-reflection and self-exploration,using two distinct prompting strategies to examine the basic abilities of DLLMs. Self-Reflection: (1)Prompting Reflection, structured reflection prompts are embedded within initial in- structions,requiring the model to perform logical self-checking during generation. (2)Autoregressive Forcing Reflection, correction prompts (e.g., \"Wait...there might be something wrong\") are replaced with the end-of- sequence (EOS) token as a post-generation intervention strategy. Self-Exploration: (1) Prompting Exploration, which embeds exploration prompts in initial instructions to activate multi-path reasoning. (2) Autoregressive Forcing Exploration, which replaces EOS token to \u201cLet\u2019s think in another way...\u201d to induce exploratory reasoning. E.3. Evaluation of Self-Reflection and Self-Exploration Capabilities In evaluating the self-reflection capabilities of the LLaDA-8B-Instruct [16] and Dream-7B-Instruct [27] models, the BigGSM dataset was utilized. During the generation process, we employed a temperature of 0.7 for self-reflection and 0.2 for self-exploration, coupled with top-p sampling set to 0.95. Additionally, diffusion steps were configured to 512, and the generation length was fixed at 512. For the investigation into the models\u2019 self-exploration capabilities, the experimental settings were identical, with the sole distinction being the substitution of the reflection strategy with an exploration strategy. Based on the setting of Qin et al. [18], we utilize the following reasoning metrics for deeper analysis: Semantic", "fixed at 512. For the investigation into the models\u2019 self-exploration capabilities, the experimental settings were identical, with the sole distinction being the substitution of the reflection strategy with an exploration strategy. Based on the setting of Qin et al. [18], we utilize the following reasoning metrics for deeper analysis: Semantic Alignment: The semantic alignment metrics [7] lies in the reasoning alignment vector, which spans from the N-step hypothesis h to the source s of length T: r-align(h \u2192s) = {\u03b11, \u03b12, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1N}, (22) where each alignment value can be calculated as: \u03b1i = r-align(hi \u2192s) = [\ufe01 1 + maxT j=1 cos(hi, sj) ]\ufe01 2 \u2208[0, 1]. (23) 22 Here, such an alignment value is the normalized cosine similarity between the reference step and the most similar sentence in a context, and explicitly measures the grounding of the step-wise reasoning with respect to the source text. The alignment vector r-align(h \u2192s) is estimated by matching the source text and the reasoning chain on the embeddings of the tokens and individual reasoning steps. A similar confidence alignment score is introduced in CTC to measure whether the information of the i-th source document token sj is supported by the hypothesis token hi, assessing whether the reasoning step hi supports the source context s. Repetition-word: To identify repeated, or paraphrased steps, we look at the repetition word scores [7] between all steps in the hypothesis chain: 1 \u2212max i=2...N max j=1...i\u22121 [\ufe03 (1/Mi) Mi \u2211\ufe01 l=1 rtoken align (hi,l \u2192hj) ]\ufe03 . For each pair of sentences, we look at the mean token alignment and find those sentences that maximize this alignment score. In other words, Repetition-Token will punish chains where there are at least two steps with high overlap in token embeddings. Informativeness: Measures how well information present in the source is used in the reasoning steps, we calculate informativeness [7]: (1/T) \u2211\ufe00T t=1 ralign(st \u2192h) + (1/N) \u2211\ufe00N i=1 ralign(hi \u2192s) 2 . Info-step gives a higher score to reasoning steps that are well-grounded with respect to the source, and identifies the degree of information from source that is covered by the generated hypothesis. A lower Info-Step score corresponds to the reasoning steps that are not related to the source sentences or have missed information provided in the context. Reasoning-Alignment : The most straightforward way to evaluate the correctness of the hypothesis chain is to compare the degree of the overlap between the hypothesis and the reference. One way of doing that is to measure the reasoning alignment [7] between them: 1 N N \u2211\ufe01 i=1 ralign(hi \u2192r). Token-Entropy : To calculate the token entropy, we will utilize the pipeline as follows: First, calculate the probability of each token p(ti), which is the frequency of token ti divided by the total number of tokens N: p(ti) = count(ti) N Next, calculate the information content I(ti) of each token, which reflects the uncertainty contribution of that token to the text: I(ti) = \u2212log(p(ti)) Finally, token-entropy is the weighted average of the information content of all tokens, given by: H =", "the total number of tokens N: p(ti) = count(ti) N Next, calculate the information content I(ti) of each token, which reflects the uncertainty contribution of that token to the text: I(ti) = \u2212log(p(ti)) Finally, token-entropy is the weighted average of the information content of all tokens, given by: H = \u2212 N \u2211\ufe01 i=1 p(ti) log(p(ti)) 23 where p(ti) is the probability of token ti, and log(p(ti)) is the corresponding logarithmic information content. Token-entropy reflects the overall uncertainty of the text. A higher value indicates that the text is more random and diverse, while a lower value suggests that the text is more focused and repetitive. Cosine similarity (Sim) Cosine similarity measures the degree of similarity between two vectors encoded by BGE [24] by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. For text embedding vectors, a value closer to 1 indicates greater semantic similarity. Let the two generated text vectors be A and B. The formula for calculating their cosine similarity is: cosine_similarity(A, B) = A \u00b7 B \u2225A\u2225\u00b7 \u2225B\u2225= \u2211\ufe00n i=1 AiBi \u221a\ufe01\u2211\ufe00n i=1 A2 i \u00b7 \u221a\ufe01\u2211\ufe00n i=1 B2 i (24) where A \u00b7 B is the dot product of vectors A and B. \u2225A\u2225and \u2225B\u2225are the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of vectors A and B. Ai and Bi represent the components of vectors A and B along the i-th dimension. Perplexity (PPL) of the Model Perplexity is a concept in information theory used to measure the uncertainty of a probabilistic model in predicting samples. In natural language processing, it is employed to evaluate how well a language model fits a set of test data. Given a sequence of N tokens W = w1, w2, . . . , wN, where the language model predicts the probability of this sequence P(W), the perplexity of the sequence is defined as: PPL(W) = P(W)\u22121 N = exp (\ufe02 \u22121 N log P(W) )\ufe02 . (25) Because of the sequence\u2019s independence assumption, we can compute P(W) as: P(W) = N \u220f\ufe01 i=1 P(wi|w1, . . . , wi\u22121). (26) Therefore, the commonly seen formula for perplexity is: PPL(W) = exp (\ufe03 \u22121 N N \u2211\ufe01 i=1 log P(wi|w1, . . . , wi\u22121) )\ufe03 , (27) where log P(W) is the log probability of the entire sequence. 1 N \u2211\ufe00N i=1 log P(wi|w1, . . . , wi\u22121) is the average log probability of the sequence under the model. exp is the exponential function, used to transform the log probability back to its original scale. Observation of the results for both DREAM [27] and LLaDA [16] models, under both self-reflection and self-exploration settings, the scores across all ROSCOE-SA evaluation metrics are highly similar. This indicates that current diffusion language models (DLLMs) have not yet genuinely acquired the deeper capabilities of self-reflection and self-exploration, as their outputs do not exhibit significant differences under varying strategic prompts. E.4. Evaluation of Deep-Reasoning Capability Following Chen et al. [3], we further investigate reasoning boundaries (RBs) in deep reasoning capabilities in mathematical reasoning.

When the model meets the question with fewer than 1 reasoning steps, accuracy surpasses 80%. Conversely, when reasoning steps exceed 3-4, accuracy falls below 10%. Moreover, we first randomly select 200 samples to generate examples and split steps from the DLLM-generated rationales based on ROSCOE [7]. Further, we also manually identify the first model\u2019s incorrect step position. F. Three-directional Inference-Time Scaling on DLLMs F.1. Parallel Scaling Experiment Details In the parallel scaling section, we utilize the dual-cache generation strategy from Fast-dLLM based on the diffusion language model LLaDA-8B-Instruct [16], and perform batch processing on the BigGSM [3] dataset. Key configurations include:diffusion_steps=256, gen_length=256, block_length=32, and a Dynamic Low-Confidence Remasking mechanism. We also employed the dual_cache generation strategy from Fast-dLLM [23] on the Dream-7B-Instruct [27] model for testing on the BigGSM reasoning dataset. The core configuration includes: diffusion_steps=256, gen_length=256, and block_length=32. The results are shown in Figure 11. It can be observed that the accuracy generally increases with higher k-values. At the initial attempts, the accuracy at Temperature 1.0 was relatively low. Although it showed significant improvement in the early stages, its later accuracy fell behind other temperatures. At Temperature 0.1, the accuracy growth was more stable initially, but eventually plateaued at around 60%, similar to Temperature 1.0. Overall, intermediate temperatures demonstrated better pass@k accuracy performance, achieving higher accuracy with more consistent and stable growth. 25 F.2.

Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Re- trieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are di- vided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge- graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node em- beddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level pre- cision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contribu- tions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re- ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections.

Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge [4, 5]. The objective is to retrieve the most relevant untrimmed video from a large, multilingual collection, even when the query language differs from the video\u2019s subtitles. Effective retrieval faces three key challenges: achieving robust multilin- gual semantics, efficiently processing lengthy videos rich in medical terminology, and bridging the gap between concise queries and comprehensive video content [6\u20138]. Existing retrieval strategies, however, fail to meet the specific demands of the mVCR task. Dual-encoder models [9\u201311] enable fast lookup through shared query\u2013video embeddings but cannot capture the extensive temporal structure of long videos [12]. Multilingual alignment techniques, whether via machine trans- lation [13] or unified embedding spaces [14], often provide insufficient coverage of the domain-specific terminology crucial to medical content. Sophisticated tem- poral models [15\u201317] are typically designed for monolingual data and, there- fore, miss essential cross-language semantics. Neural re-rankers based on cross- encoders [18, 6] or LLMs [19] deliver precise relevance scores but incur prohibitive computational costs when applied as first-stage filters for large corpora, limiting practical scalability. Consequently, no single approach simultaneously achieves efficient multilingual retrieval, fidelity to medical terminology [20], and tractable processing of long videos. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a multi-stage framework that delivers efficient and accurate mVCR.

Consequently, no single approach simultaneously achieves efficient multilingual retrieval, fidelity to medical terminology [20], and tractable processing of long videos. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a multi-stage framework that delivers efficient and accurate mVCR. Subtitles are segmented into semantic chunks, enriched with KG facts, and then organized using LaBSE [21] embed- dings into a hierarchical index for coarse-to-fine retrieval. An embedded query initiates a tree search that prunes irrelevant branches early to reduce search costs. Finally, only the top candidate chunks are re-ranked by a lightweight mul- tilingual LLM, yielding nuanced relevance scores without processing the entire corpus. The main contributions of this work are: (1) A modular architecture that combines semantic chunking, domain-specific KG enrichment, and multilingual embeddings to enable scalable search in long medical videos. (2) A dynamic tree-pruning strategy that balances efficiency and precision by narrowing the search space before LLM re-ranking. (3) State-of-the-art results on the mVCR test set, supported by ablation studies that isolate the impact of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and LLM re-ranking. 2 Related Work Early video retrieval struggled with semantic gaps due to its reliance on low- level features and metadata. Deep dual encoders [9\u201311] improved scalability via independent indexing of joint query-video embeddings. However, they often ne- glected fine-grained cross-modal interactions and struggled to represent long temporal sequences [12]. Transformers have further enhanced temporal reason- Hierarchical Indexing with KG Enrichment 3 ing, with models like CLIP4Clip [22] demonstrating the efficacy of frame ag- gregation. Subsequent refinements in temporal alignment using sliding windows or segment attention [15, 16] also showed promise. Nevertheless, these methods are predominantly monolingual and general-domain, making them unsuitable for domain-specific terminology and multilingual queries in mVCR. Multilingual retrieval initially relied on machine translation, but poor trans- lation quality limited performance, spurring direct alignment techniques that embed sentences into unified semantic spaces. Models like LaBSE [21] and other language-agnostic embeddings proved effective for multilingual sentence retrieval and on benchmarks like VATEX [14], which contains bilingual captions for short videos. Nonetheless, VATEX\u2019s short videos differ significantly from the long, pro- cedural, terminology-dense medical videos in mVCR. Adapting these techniques to specialized, lengthy, code-mixed content remains challenging. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer structured relational information to mitigate vocabulary discrepancies between queries and video content. Early strategies involved query expansion and path-based reasoning for enhanced recall [23]. VideoGraph [24] integrates KG entities with shot-level video features for open- domain search, while BioSyn [25] uses UMLS to link clinical terms by synthe- sizing synonyms, improving retrieval in noisy settings. Despite these advances, most KG-augmented approaches focus on text or short video clips. Effectively incorporating KG information into long, multilingual instructional videos while preserving temporal coherence remains unaddressed. Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advanced re-ranking by cap- turing nuanced query-document semantics [26, 27]. BERT-based cross-encoders [18, 6] substantially outperform traditional passage re-ranking methods.

Their computational expense remains a primary drawback, as cross-encoders scale quadratically with input length, making them unsuitable as first-stage filters for large collections of long videos. This compu- tational bottleneck significantly challenges the application of advanced semantic matching to long-form, multilingual video retrieval. 3 Methods Our multi-stage framework addresses the mVCR challenge of retrieving relevant videos when the query and subtitle languages differ. At its core, our pipeline enriches subtitles with KG facts and builds a hierarchical index for each video, enabling efficient coarse-to-fine retrieval. The system consists of two main phases: Hierarchical Index Construction (Section 3.2) and Retrieval & Ranking (Sections 3.3-3.4). This design effectively scales to long videos while bridging language gaps between queries and video content. 3.1 Task Formulation Let V = {v1, . . . , vN} denote a collection of N medical instructional videos. Each video vi is associated with a set of subtitles Si (in its original language Li) and 4 Y. Wang et al. a collection of relevant KG triples Ki. Let Q be the space of user queries, where a query Q \u2208Q may be expressed in any supported language LQ. The objective is to learn a retrieval function f : Q \u00d7 V \u2192Ranking that generates a ranked list of videos from V based on their relevance to a given query Q. Fig. 1. Overview of proposed multilingual video retrieval pipeline. 3.2 Hierarchical Index Construction For each video vi \u2208V, we construct an enriched hierarchical index Ti through three key steps: segmenting subtitles into semantic chunks, enhancing these chunks with relevant KG context, and organizing them into a hierarchical tree structure. Subtitle Loading and Semantic Chunking. Segmenting lengthy instruc- tional videos requires preserving semantic coherence. We begin by loading sub- title data Si = {\u21131, . . . , \u2113mi} for each video and performing basic text cleaning. To avoid disrupting the instructional flow of arbitrary divisions, our approach employs semantic chunking based on the similarity between adjacent subtitle lines. The LaBSE model, with its strong multilingual representation capabili- ties, provides embeddings for these subtitle lines: e(\u2113k) = LaBSE(\u2113k) \u2208Rd (1) Hierarchical Indexing with KG Enrichment 5 where e(\u2113k) represents the d-dimensional embedding for subtitle line \u2113k. Chunk boundaries are detected by identifying points where the cosine similarity between adjacent embeddings falls below an empirically tuned threshold \u03c4: cos(e(\u2113k), e(\u2113k+1)) < \u03c4 (2) This boundary detection yields a sequence of chunks c1 i , . . . , cMi i for video vi, each containing semantically coherent subtitle lines in the original language Li. KG Enrichment via Text Concatenation. To enhance semantic representa- tion with domain knowledge, each chunk cj i is enriched using the set of KG triples Ki relevant to its corresponding video vi.

These entities directly guide", "representa- tion with domain knowledge, each chunk cj i is enriched using the set of KG triples Ki relevant to its corresponding video vi. We identify medical entities in cj i using a multilingual Named Entity Recognizer, specifically an XLM-RoBERTa model fine-tuned for multilingual NER [28]. These entities directly guide the selection of relevant knowledge. Specifically, for each identified entity, we retrieve all triples from the video\u2019s pre-filtered set Ki where it appears as either the subject or the object. This enrichment occurs via straightforward text concatenation: key information from the retrieved triples, such as entity relationships and types, is converted into concise, factual statements and appended to the chunk\u2019s original text. The resulting enriched chunk, \u02dccj i, thus integrates relevant domain knowl- edge while preserving the original content structure. Tree Construction. The hierarchical organization of enriched chunks forms the foundation of our efficient retrieval approach. We encode each enriched chunk into a vector representation using LaBSE: uj i = LaBSE(\u02dccj i) (3) where uj i represents the enriched chunk in the shared multilingual semantic space. We implement a two-level clustering strategy to create a structure that captures both broad topics and specific details. First, K-means partitions the set of embeddings {uj i} for video vi into K coarse clusters that serve as first-level nodes representing major topics. Then, for each coarse cluster, we apply HAC to develop deeper tree levels that reveal finer-grained subtopics. Each node n in the resulting tree Ti stores a representative embedding en, calculated as the centroid of Cn, the set of embeddings corresponding to all chunks descended from node n: en = 1 |Cn| X u\u2208Cn u (4) This centroid en effectively summarizes the semantic content of node n. The completed hierarchical structure Ti, whose leaf nodes are the individual enriched chunks \u02dccj i, enables the efficient coarse-to-fine search. 3.3 Query Processing and Initial Retrieval After constructing hierarchical indices for all videos, our system processes in- coming user queries and performs efficient retrieval across these structured rep- 6 Y. Wang et al. resentations to identify relevant candidate chunks. Query Processing. Given a user query Q in language LQ, we encode it using the same LaBSE model employed during the indexing phase: q = LaBSE(Q) (5) This consistent encoding projects the query vector q and the chunk embeddings uj i into a shared multilingual semantic space, enabling comparisons based on con- ceptual similarity rather than exact lexical matching. Consequently, the system gains inherent robustness against linguistic variations, such as those introduced by translation. Dynamic Tree Search. Rather than exhaustively comparing the query against all chunks, we implement a coarse-to-fine search strategy that leverages the hier- archical index Ti of each video. The search commences by computing the cosine similarity between the query embedding q and the embeddings en of the first- level (K-means) cluster nodes. Using a predefined relevance threshold \u03b8, only top-level clusters whose similarity exceeds this threshold are retained, effectively pruning irrelevant branches early in the search. For each qualifying cluster, the search recursively descends its subtree (generated by HAC), applying the same pruning logic", "en of the first- level (K-means) cluster nodes. Using a predefined relevance threshold \u03b8, only top-level clusters whose similarity exceeds this threshold are retained, effectively pruning irrelevant branches early in the search. For each qualifying cluster, the search recursively descends its subtree (generated by HAC), applying the same pruning logic at each level to traverse only promising branches. This traversal continues until reaching leaf nodes (the enriched chunks \u02dccj i) via unpruned paths. The resulting candidate set comprises all leaf nodes reached through this process. Each candidate is recorded as a tuple (video id, chunk id, cos(q, uj i), \u02dccj i), with its cosine similarity serving as an initial relevance score. These candidates are then ranked to form a top-M list, Ctop, for subsequent re-ranking. This hierarchical search offers significant computational improvements over a brute-force scan. By dynamically pruning the search space, it ensures the expensive LLM re-ranker processes only a few top candidates, which is critical for balancing high precision with the scalability and low latency required for large video corpora. 3.4 LLM Re-ranking and Video Aggregation While embedding similarity provides efficient initial retrieval, achieving optimal ranking requires a deeper semantic understanding. In this final phase, we refine the ranking of candidate chunks using a multilingual LLM and then aggregate these scores to produce video-level results. Multilingual LLM Re-ranking. Embedding-based similarity captures broad semantic relationships but often misses nuanced relevance factors crucial for medical queries. To address this limitation, we implement LLM-based re-ranking that leverages multilingual understanding capabilities. For each candidate chunk \u02dccj i \u2208Ctop, we prompt the LLM with the original query Q (in language LQ) and the chunk\u2019s enriched text \u02dccj i (in its original language Li). The model then pro- duces a scalar relevance rating \u03c1(\u02dccj i) on a 1\u20133 scale (where 3 indicates highest Hierarchical Indexing with KG Enrichment 7 relevance), providing a fine-grained assessment that surpasses simple vector simi- larity. While the LLM\u2019s nuanced semantic understanding leads to highly effective scoring, this performance comes with a trade-off: the model\u2019s internal reasoning is largely opaque, limiting its interpretability. Video-level Aggregation and Ranking. The mVCR task requires video-level rankings rather than chunk-level results. We aggregate the chunk scores for each video vi using max pooling, which assigns each video the highest relevance score achieved by any of its evaluated chunks: Score(vi) = max \u02dccj i \u2208Ci top \u03c1(\u02dccj i) (6) where Ci top represents the set of top chunks belonging to video vi. This ap- proach prioritizes videos containing highly relevant content chunks, even if other portions are less pertinent. The final output ranks all videos {v1, . . . , vN} in de- scending order of Score(vi). 4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset and Evaluation The dataset features medical instructional videos crawled from YouTube, with textual content that includes original subtitles and generated captions in both Chinese and English.

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) [30] is calculated as: MRR = 1 |V | |V | X i=1 1 Ranki (7) 8 Y. Wang et al. where |V | represents the number of test queries, and Ranki is the position of the ground-truth video in the predicted list for the i-th query. The Overall score, serving as the main ranking criterion, is calculated by summing the four metrics: Overall = |M| X i=1 Valuei (8) where |M| = 4 is the number of evaluation metrics, and Valuei represents the value of the i-th metric. 4.2 Main Results Table 2.

Key competitors include GEN [32], which implemented a re- trieval framework based on approaches surveyed in recent literature. DSG-1 [33, 34] developed a two-stage retrieval-reranking pipeline that employed GPT-3.51 for video summary generation and RoBERTa [36] for initial retrieval, followed by a CCGS-VCR analyzer for re-ranking. The MQuA approach [35], from the 2024 challenge, leveraged the DeBERTa-v2-710M-Chinese [37] model combined with Multi-Level Video Moment Refinement (MVMR) and enhanced it with Multi- lingual Query Paraphrase Generation (MQPG) using Few-shot ChatGPT [38]. As shown in Table 2, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art perfor- mance across all evaluation metrics on the mVCR test set, achieving the highest scores in R@1 (0.3264), R@10 (0.4211), R@50 (0.5177), MRR (0.3407), and Overall (1.6059). Compared to GEN [32], our method demonstrates substantial improvements with absolute increases of 0.1953\u2191in R@1, 0.3137\u2191in R@10, 0.4199\u2191in R@50, 0.2265\u2191in MRR, and 1.1554\u2191in Overall score.

Hierarchical Indexing with KG Enrichment 9 Furthermore, our method outperforms the sun team\u2019s MQuA approach [35] with consistent gains of 0.0143\u2191in R@1, 0.0133\u2191in R@10, 0.0211\u2191in R@50, 0.0162\u2191 in MRR, and 0.0649\u2191in Overall score. These consistent improvements validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage retrieval framework. The performance gains are particularly significant for R@1 and MRR metrics, highlighting the superior precision of our approach in re- trieving the most relevant video as the top result for multilingual medical video retrieval tasks. 4.3 Ablation Study We conduct ablation experiments to evaluate the impact of each core compo- nent by systematically removing modules from our framework. Generally, all reported percentage changes represent relative decreases from the full system\u2019s performance. Removing domain-specific KG enrichment decreases the Overall score by 6.6% and R@1 by 7.6%. These results confirm KG enrichment\u2019s crucial role in enhancing semantic representations, particularly in bridging specialized medical terminology between queries and video content. When our hierarchical index is replaced with flat retrieval, performance de- grades further, with the Overall score dropping by an additional 2.7%. Notable declines appear in MRR (12.4%) and R@50 (8.4%), showing that flat indexing struggles with long-form videos even under relaxed retrieval criteria. The mag- nitude of this performance gap underscores the effectiveness of the hierarchical organization for efficient pruning and improved precision. Table 3. Impact of removing key components from the proposed framework on retrieval performance.

Per- formance metrics show the most significant deterioration here, with R@10 and MRR falling by 14.2% and 14.6% respectively. Such pronounced degradation relative to other ablations demonstrates that the LLM\u2019s nuanced understand- ing of query-video semantic relationships is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance in multilingual medical video retrieval. 5 Conclusion We have presented a solution to the mVCR challenge that addresses key limita- tions in retrieving multilingual medical videos. By integrating language-agnostic 10 Y. Wang et al. embeddings with domain knowledge and efficient hierarchical search, our frame- work achieves both computational scalability and multilingual precision. Exper- iments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and ablation studies confirm that each component makes complementary contributions to the effectiveness of multilingual video retrieval.

Hedderich Center for Information and Language Processing, LMU Munich Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) {rzhao, yihong, hedderich}@cis.lmu.de Abstract Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, par- ticularly in high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined final- answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves, i.e., the intermedi- ate steps that lead to the final answer, remain un- derexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT rea- soning, evaluating three key dimensions: per- formance, consistency, and faithfulness. We be- gin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong lan- guage preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchang- ing them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt lan- guage. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques \u2013 i.e., truncation and error injection \u2013 to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support future research.1 1 Introduction CoT prompting has emerged as a widely adopted technique for eliciting step-by-step thinking traces from LRMs (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023). These traces have been shown to substantially improve model performance on complex reasoning tasks, while also offering an in- terpretable window for understanding the model\u2019s internal decision-making process (Grattafiori et al., 2024; OpenAI et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025). *Equal contribution. 1https://github.com/mainlp/Multilingual-CoT-Evaluation While most research on CoT reasoning has fo- cused on English, the behavior of thinking traces in multilingual settings remains underexplored. A very recent line of studies has begun to examine LRM performance across languages, including sce- narios where models are explicitly instructed or \u201cforced\u201d to reason in a specific language (Yong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Qi et al., 2025). However, these efforts largely concentrate on final- answer accuracy, leaving open critical questions about the reasoning process itself, particularly: (1) How consistent are the thinking traces across lan- guages when answering semantically equivalent questions? and (2) To what extent are thinking traces faithful in languages other than English, especially the low-resource ones? To address these gaps, we conduct the first com- prehensive evaluation of multilingual CoT reason- ing across a diverse set of LRMs. Our study fo- cuses on three core dimensions: performance, con- sistency, and faithfulness. In \u00a74, we analyze lan- guage compliance, final-answer accuracy, and final- answer consistency when models are either explic- itly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a lan- guage aligned with the input. We find that LRMs exhibit strong language preferences during reason- ing, and that performance varies substantially de- pending on the thinking language. To better un- derstand", "accuracy, and final- answer consistency when models are either explic- itly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a lan- guage aligned with the input. We find that LRMs exhibit strong language preferences during reason- ing, and that performance varies substantially de- pending on the thinking language. To better un- derstand these disparities, \u00a75 introduces a novel method for interchanging thinking traces across languages. By substituting a thinking trace from one language into another, we assess whether rea- soning is semantically aligned and transferable. Our results show that thinking traces are often in- consistent across languages, with quality varying largely by language. Surprisingly, we also find that final-answer accuracy is influenced not only by the thinking trace itself but also by the prompt language and thinking language. In \u00a76, we evaluate the faithfulness of thinking traces. Extending prior monolingual work (Lanham et al., 2023), we apply arXiv:2510.09555v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 perturbation-based interventions \u2013 such as trunca- tion and error injection \u2013 and measure how these changes impact model predictions. We find that models rely on their thinking traces to varying de- grees across languages, suggesting that faithfulness is not uniformly preserved in multilingual contexts. Overall, we make the following contributions: (i) We present the first comprehensive evaluation of multilingual CoT reasoning, covering three core dimensions \u2013 performance, consistency, and faith- fulness. (ii) We propose a novel strategy: crosslin- gual thinking trace interchanging, to measure the semantic consistency of thinking traces across lan- guages. (iii) We find that consistency of thinking traces varies across languages, and even with iden- tical traces, accuracy is influenced by the language of the prompt. (iv) We show that languages other than English exhibit greater reliance on thinking traces, and that this reliance decreases as model scale increases. (v) We will release our code to facilitate future research on the evaluation of con- sistency and faithfulness in multilingual reasoning. 2 Related Work Faithfulness in CoT Reasoning CoT prompt- ing (Wei et al., 2022) has been shown to substan- tially improve the performance of LRMs across a variety of complex tasks (OpenAI et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025; DeepSeek- AI et al., 2025). Despite these gains, recent stud- ies have raised concerns about the faithfulness of the generated thinking traces, i.e., whether the model\u2019s stated CoT truly reflects its internal decision-making process (Lyu et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023; Tanneru et al., 2024; Arcuschin et al., 2025). One line of work evaluates faithfulness by introducing biases into the prompt, such as reordering multiple-choice options or injecting misleading arguments, and examin- ing whether the model\u2019s answer changes accord- ingly (Turpin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Chua et al., 2025). Another line of work manipulates the thinking trace itself, e.g., by truncating it or insert- ing errors, and observes how such changes affect the model\u2019s prediction (Lanham et al., 2023; Yee et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2025). These studies gen- erally reveal that models may produce a thinking trace that is disconnected from the actual decision path leading", "e.g., by truncating it or insert- ing errors, and observes how such changes affect the model\u2019s prediction (Lanham et al., 2023; Yee et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2025). These studies gen- erally reveal that models may produce a thinking trace that is disconnected from the actual decision path leading to the answer. Our work builds on this latter line by extending it to multilingual settings. We manipulate thinking traces across languages, addressing the gap that existing studies evaluate faithfulness almost exclusively in English. Evaluation of Multilingual Reasoning A grow- ing body of work has evaluated CoT reasoning across languages (Shi et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023; Ahuja et al., 2023), showing that CoT prompting improves performance on a variety of multilingual tasks. More recent studies explore how manipulating the thinking trace, such as increasing the generation budget at test time or enforcing language-specific reasoning, can further affect model performance (Yong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Qi et al., 2025). These works high- light that models often benefit from reasoning in high-resource languages like English or Chinese, or from being given more space to reason. However, existing multilingual reasoning evaluation studies almost exclusively focus on performance, overlook- ing whether models behave consistently across lan- guages \u2013 that is, whether they produce correct an- swers consistently and whether the thinking traces themselves are semantically equivalent across lan- guages. Such questions are especially important as LRMs are increasingly deployed in multilingual contexts (Ghosh et al., 2025). Our work moves be- yond performance to offer a systematic evaluation of multilingual CoT reasoning along two additional dimensions: consistency and faithfulness, provid- ing a complementary perspective on how reasoning behavior generalizes across languages. 3 Experimental Setup 3.1 Models We evaluate a wide range of open-source LRMs of different model sizes. We consider the distilled versions of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025): DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-{1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B} whose base models are from Qwen2.5 family (Qwen Team et al., 2025) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-{8B, 70B} whose base models are from Llama3 family (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Additionally, we con- sider two models from Qwen3 family (Yang et al., 2025): Qwen3-{8B, 32B}. 3.2 Dataset MMMLU Multilingual MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) is a large-scale benchmark of general knowledge across various domains, such as Human- ities and STEM, in a multiple-choice-question for- mat, covering 15 typologically different languages. MGSM Multilingual Grade School Math (Shi et al., 2023b) is a benchmark that contains 250 grade-school math problems from the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (originally in English) that are manually translated into 10 additional languages. 3.3 Controlling Thinking Languages Our motivation is that the language used for reason- ing should match the language of the question, as users are very likely to prefer inspecting the reason- ing process in the same language they use to pose the query. Accordingly, we consider two strategies for controlling the thinking language, i.e., the lan- guage used in the thinking trace (text generated be- tween the special tokens <think> and </think>), to ensure it aligns with the prompt language, i.e., the language", "in the same language they use to pose the query. Accordingly, we consider two strategies for controlling the thinking language, i.e., the lan- guage used in the thinking trace (text generated be- tween the special tokens <think> and </think>), to ensure it aligns with the prompt language, i.e., the language used in the original question. Explicit Instruction The first strategy appends an explicit instruction to the prompt, directly ask- ing the model to think in a particular language. For example, to elicit German reasoning, we insert the phrase \u201cBitte denken Sie immer auf Deutsch.\u201d [\u201cPlease always think in German.\u201d] into the prompt. While intuitive, this approach seems less reliable: models may still default to their preferred think- ing language, typically English, regardless of the instruction (Yong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). Prompt Hacking The second strategy uses prompt hacking, a more targeted method to steer the model\u2019s language use (Schulhoff et al., 2023; Benjamin et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2025). Here, a short prefix in the desired language (e.g., \u201cAuf Anfrage werde ich anfangen, auf Deutsch zu denken.\u201d [\u201cBy Request, I will begin to think in German\u201d] is inserted directly after the <think> token. The model is then expected to generate the remainder of the thinking trace, until the </think> token. This approach has been shown to be more effective than explicit instructions, often leading to language-consistent CoT generation that aligns with the prefix (Yong et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2025). 4 Language Compliance, Answer Accuracy, and Consistency In this section, we evaluate the multilingual reason- ing performance of LRMs under the two language control strategies introduced in \u00a73.3. Using the metrics defined in \u00a74.1, we assess each model\u2019s language compliance, final-answer accuracy, and crosslingual answer consistency. These results, pre- sented and discussed in \u00a74.2, allow us to examine the effectiveness of language control mechanisms and how the choice of thinking language influences model behavior. This multi-dimensional evalua- tion provides a foundation for our deeper analyses in later sections, particularly regarding reasoning consistency and faithfulness across languages. 4.1 Evaluation Metrics Language Compliance Rate This metric mea- sures the proportion of text within the thinking trace \u2013 i.e., between the special tokens <think> and </think> \u2013 that is generated in the intended target language (the prompt language). To com- pute this, we first split each thinking trace into individual sentences and then identify the language of each sentence using GlotLID (Kargaran et al., 2023). We then compute the overall proportion of reasoning content generated in the corresponding prompt language, following prior work (Yong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Qi et al., 2025).2 Final Answer Accuracy This metric evaluates the correctness of the model\u2019s final prediction: ACC(l) = 1 |D| P|D| i=1 1 \u0002 M(ql i) = ol i) \u0003 where D is the dataset, M(ql i) the model prediction, and ol i the gold answer for question i. We compute accuracy independently for each language l. Final Answer Consistency This metric quanti- fies the crosslingual consistency of model predic- tions. Given the same question posed in two", "i) \u0003 where D is the dataset, M(ql i) the model prediction, and ol i the gold answer for question i. We compute accuracy independently for each language l. Final Answer Consistency This metric quanti- fies the crosslingual consistency of model predic- tions. Given the same question posed in two lan- guages, we evaluate whether the model produces the same and correct answer in both languages: CO(l1, l2) = P|D| i=1 1[M(ql1 i )=ol1 i \u2227M(ql2 i )=ol2 i ] P|D| i=1 1[M(ql1 i )=ol1 i \u2228M(ql2 i )=ol2 i ] Consistency is widely used as a metric in knowl- edge probing, factual knowledge recall, and cul- tural awareness evaluation (Jiang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2025a; Zhao et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025a). 4.2 Results and Discussion Table 1 reports the accuracy and language compli- ance rates of the evaluated LRMs on MMMLU across languages.

Similar language pairs, such as German and English, show higher consistency. Each cell shows the final-answer consistency between the language on the x-axis and the language on the y-axis. Enforcing target-language reasoning improves compliance but may harm performance. When models are explicitly instructed to think in the same language as the prompt language, many fail to fol- low the instruction \u2013 especially in lower-resource languages such as Bengali (bn) and Yoruba (yo), which show low language compliance rates (less than 0.2 across all models).3 Prompt hacking, by contrast, substantially improves language compli- ance, leading to very high alignment between the prompt and thinking language. However, this im- proved compliance often comes at the cost of re- duced final-answer accuracy. For instance, while all models achieve remarkable compliance when forced to reason in Yoruba via prompt hacking, their accuracy drops substantially compared to ex- plicit instruction. This reveals a trade-off between language control and task performance, consistent with findings in prior work (Qi et al., 2025). Answer consistency reflects typological proxim- ity across languages. Under both prompt hack- ing and explicit instruction setup, we observe that models exhibit high answer consistency across ty- pologically similar languages. For instance, con- sistencies among Indo-European languages, e.g., English (en), German (de), and French (fr), tend 3Models typically default to English reasoning. See \u00a7A.1 for the English proportion in different thinking traces. to be high. To verify this, we compute average consistency for Indo-European language pairs ver- sus mixed pairs (i.e., one Indo-European and one non\u2013Indo-European), and find that the former is significantly higher (cf. Table 4 in \u00a7A.1.2). This suggests that models reason similarly in these re- lated languages. In R1-Llama-70B, though the scaling improves the answer accuracy (cf. Table 1), the answer consistency is lower than that of its counterpart R1-Qwen-32B (cf. Figure 1), possibly due to different underlying base models. Neverthe- less, the same trend holds: consistency is generally high among typologically similar languages. Performance disparities persist across language control strategies, reflecting data exposure dur- ing training. Models consistently perform better on high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, which", "(cf. Figure 1), possibly due to different underlying base models. Neverthe- less, the same trend holds: consistency is generally high among typologically similar languages. Performance disparities persist across language control strategies, reflecting data exposure dur- ing training. Models consistently perform better on high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, which are overrepresented in pretraining and instruction tuning. In contrast, low-resource languages like Swahili and Yoruba yield lower ac- curacy in both explicit instruction and prompt hack- ing setups. These persistent gaps raise one core research question: Why do models show different performance when the actual thinking languages vary, even with semantically equivalent prompts? We hypothesize that this effect stems from inconsis- tencies in the quality and semantics of the thinking traces across languages \u2013 which we explore in \u00a75. Summary. Our analysis reveals three key pat- terns. First, models do not follow explicit instruc- tions well, and while prompt hacking effectively enforces target-language reasoning, it often reduces accuracy. Second, consistency is high between sim- ilar languages. Finally, substantial performance gaps persist across languages regardless of control strategy, suggesting that inconsistencies in thinking trace quality may drive these gaps. 5 Consistency of Thinking Traces We hypothesize that the disparities in final-answer accuracy and consistency observed in \u00a74 stem pri- marily from the quality and semantic inconsistency of the generated thinking traces across languages. To investigate this, we introduce several novel sub- stitution methods to evaluate the consistency of thinking traces between languages (\u00a75.1). We fur- ther propose a new metric, substitution consistency, which quantifies how model predictions change be- fore and after thinking trace substitution (\u00a75.2). We then present and interpret our findings in \u00a75.3. 5.1 Thinking Trace Interchanging To better understand the disparities in thinking traces across languages, we consider three crosslin- gual substitution methods, each revealing different aspects of multilingual reasoning behavior. For the substitution, we reuse the thinking traces obtained for different languages in \u00a74 and ask the model to directly generate the final answer based on the prompts and substituted thinking traces. BaseSub In this setup, we interchange the think- ing traces between languages l1 and l2 that are generated under explicit instruction. Since mod- els often default to high-resource languages, even when instructed otherwise, many of these traces are in English regardless of the prompt language. This method allows us to understand why mod- els present different performance even though the thinking language remains roughly flexible, but the prompt language varies. HackSub Here, we interchange thinking traces generated under the prompt hacking setup. In this case, the thinking traces typically align with the prompt language due to the strong language control enforced by hacking prefixes. By interchanging these language-specific thinking traces between languages l1 and l2, we can examine how consistent the thinking traces are. TransSub We first translate the thinking traces obtained under the prompt hacking setup into En- glish using the Google Translate API.4 We then interchange the translated English traces between language pairs l1 and l2. This setup removes the confounding variable of thinking language by stan- dardizing all thinking traces to English. It provides", "translate the thinking traces obtained under the prompt hacking setup into En- glish using the Google Translate API.4 We then interchange the translated English traces between language pairs l1 and l2. This setup removes the confounding variable of thinking language by stan- dardizing all thinking traces to English. It provides a controlled environment to assess the quality of the generated thinking traces, independent of their original thinking languages. 5.2 Substitution Consistency Beyond the final-answer accuracy defined in \u00a74.1, we introduce substitution consistency to quantify how a model\u2019s predictions in language l change after its thinking trace is substituted with one from another language l\u2032. Formally, let Cl denote the set of indices of questions for which the model pro- duces a correct prediction in language l under the original thinking trace, and let Cl\u2032\u2192l denote the set of indices for which the model produces a correct prediction in l after the thinking trace from l\u2032 is substituted into l. We compute substitution consis- tency as the intersection-over-union (IoU) between these two sets: CO(l\u2032, l) = |Cl\u2229Cl\u2032\u2192l| |Cl\u222aCl\u2032\u2192l|. Intuitively, CO(l\u2032, l) measures how stable the model\u2019s correct predictions in l remain after replacing its thinking trace with one from l\u2032. Note that this metric is not symmetric \u2013 i.e., CO(l\u2032, l) \u0338= CO(l, l\u2032) \u2013 be- cause it specifically evaluates how the predictions in l change when thinking traces from another lan- guage are introduced. 5.3 Results and Discussion Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the final-answer accu- racy and substitution consistency, respectively, of R1-Qwen-14B under the three substitution strate- gies introduced in \u00a75.1 for MGSM, where thinking traces are interchanged across languages. Interchanging thinking traces substantially af- fects performance, revealing quality disparities across languages. We find that substituting think- ing traces from one language into another often leads to large performance shifts. Low-resource languages generally benefit from substitution with high-resource thinking traces, while high-resource languages tend to suffer performance degradation when traces from low-resource languages are in- jected. For example, under the HackSub strategy, the accuracy of Chinese (zh) drops to 0.40 when 4https://cloud.google.com/translate bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh .63 .58 .65 .64 .59 .64 .65 .64 .64 .62 .66 .83 .69 .84 .83 .74 .85 .84 .83 .83 .81 .85 .85 .72 .85 .84 .74 .85 .87 .85 .84 .83 .86 .85 .75 .85 .83 .77 .86 .86 .85 .84 .81 .85 .78 .67 .80 .78 .68 .79 .79 .79 .78 .74 .79 .74 .64 .77 .74 .68 .75 .75 .74 .74 .74 .75 .86 .77 .86 .84 .78 .87 .87 .85 .86 .85 .87 .29 .30 .32 .32 .32 .32 .33 .26 .28 .30 .34 .34 .34 .39 .38 .34 .37 .37 .34 .32 .36 .36 .81 .74 .83 .82 .76 .82 .84 .82 .81 .80 .82 .86 .73 .87 .85 .76 .87 .86 .86 .86 .84 .88 R1-Qwen-14B | MGSM | BaseSub bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te", ".32 .36 .36 .81 .74 .83 .82 .76 .82 .84 .82 .81 .80 .82 .86 .73 .87 .85 .76 .87 .86 .86 .86 .84 .88 R1-Qwen-14B | MGSM | BaseSub bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh .64 .56 .65 .64 .56 .64 .66 .64 .64 .63 .65 .83 .68 .84 .83 .71 .84 .84 .83 .81 .81 .85 .85 .70 .86 .83 .75 .86 .87 .85 .85 .81 .86 .84 .74 .84 .84 .77 .86 .86 .84 .84 .83 .86 .78 .68 .79 .77 .68 .78 .79 .78 .78 .76 .79 .75 .65 .76 .74 .68 .75 .75 .74 .74 .73 .76 .85 .77 .87 .85 .78 .87 .86 .84 .86 .83 .87 .31 .30 .33 .32 .30 .31 .32 .26 .28 .31 .34 .39 .32 .41 .40 .36 .40 .42 .37 .38 .39 .40 .81 .74 .81 .81 .76 .81 .83 .82 .81 .80 .82 .87 .74 .87 .84 .74 .87 .88 .87 .87 .83 .87 R1-Qwen-14B | MGSM | HackSub bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh .63 .55 .64 .64 .60 .64 .66 .64 .64 .65 .66 .82 .72 .84 .84 .76 .84 .84 .83 .84 .81 .85 .84 .73 .85 .84 .77 .87 .85 .85 .85 .82 .86 .86 .77 .86 .83 .79 .86 .86 .85 .85 .82 .86 .78 .70 .80 .76 .74 .79 .79 .78 .78 .74 .80 .74 .64 .73 .75 .69 .74 .75 .74 .74 .72 .75 .86 .76 .86 .84 .81 .86 .87 .86 .84 .82 .87 .34 .31 .35 .34 .30 .34 .34 .28 .30 .32 .34 .35 .33 .37 .36 .34 .36 .38 .34 .34 .35 .37 .82 .70 .82 .81 .75 .82 .82 .81 .82 .80 .82 .86 .72 .86 .84 .80 .87 .86 .86 .86 .84 .87 R1-Qwen-14B | MGSM | TransSub 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 2: Final-answer accuracy of R1-Qwen-14B model under three thinking trace substitutions: BaseSub, HackSub, and TransSub.

Each cell indicates the consistency between the original predictions in the language on the x-axis and the predictions after injecting thinking traces from the language on the y-axis. Higher consistency is observed when traces are substituted between similar languages. thinking traces from Telugu (te) are used. Con- versely, Telugu\u2019s accuracy rises to 0.87 when using traces from Chinese. This pattern is consistent across all three substitution strategies, suggesting that the quality of thinking traces varies dramati- cally across languages. Substitution consistency is high between typologically-similar or resource-rich language pairs. We find that interchanging thinking traces between typologically-similar languages \u2013 such as English and German \u2013 yields relatively high sub- stitution consistency.

Substitution consistency is high between typologically-similar or resource-rich language pairs. We find that interchanging thinking traces between typologically-similar languages \u2013 such as English and German \u2013 yields relatively high sub- stitution consistency. In contrast, substitution be- tween more distant language pairs (e.g., Bengali and French) results in lower consistency (e.g., 0.61 in BaseSub). We further verify this by comparing the substitution consistency among different lan- guage pairs in Table 10 in \u00a7A.2. We also observe that language pairs where both languages are high- resource \u2013 i.e., well-represented in the model\u2019s pre- training data \u2013 tend to exhibit higher consistency. These findings suggest that the semantic consis- tency of thinking traces is easier to preserve when languages share language/geographic similarity or strong pretraining exposure. Thinking traces alone do not fully determine final-answer accuracy. While thinking trace quality plays a major role in performance, it is not the only factor. We observe cases where mod- els perform better in high-resource languages even when using identical thinking traces from low- resource languages. For example, when Swahili traces are injected into English prompts, the model achieves 0.33 accuracy \u2013 higher than Swahili\u2019s own original accuracy of 0.26 in HackSub (cf. Figure 2). This indicates that the prompt language also influ- ences performance. Models sometimes leverage English thinking traces better, even when semantically equiva- lent. An interesting pattern emerges when com- paring HackSub and TransSub for Swahili accu- racy (cf. Figure 2). When Swahili or Telugu think- ing traces are first translated into English and then injected into other languages, the model usually achieves higher accuracy than when using the origi- nal Swahili or Telugu traces directly. This suggests that models are better at utilizing thinking traces expressed in English, even when the underlying semantics remain unchanged. This bias toward En- glish may stem from both pretraining exposure and instruction tuning in English-heavy corpora. Summary.

Semantic consistency of thinking traces across languages is also subopti- mal, indicating that models do not generate equally aligned reasoning in different languages. Lastly, our results highlight that final-answer accuracy is jointly influenced by the prompt language, thinking language, and the thinking trace. 6 Faithfulness of Thinking Traces In \u00a75, we observed that thinking traces generated by LRMs are not consistent and not of the same quality across languages. In this section, we go one step further to explore the question: Are thinking traces faithful across languages? That is, do the generated reasoning steps reflect the actual reason- ing process by which the model arrives at its final answer? Prior", "consistent and not of the same quality across languages. In this section, we go one step further to explore the question: Are thinking traces faithful across languages? That is, do the generated reasoning steps reflect the actual reason- ing process by which the model arrives at its final answer? Prior monolingual studies have shown that traces can be unfaithful (Lanham et al., 2023). However, whether this generalizes to other lan- guages remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we perturb the thinking traces and measure how these changes affect model predictions across languages. We describe the perturbation strategies in \u00a76.1 and present results and discussion in \u00a76.2. 6.1 Adding Perturbations to Thinking Traces Following Lanham et al. (2023), we adopt two perturbation strategies to evaluate whether the model\u2019s final answer depends on its thinking traces. The more a model\u2019s predictions are influenced by changes to the thinking trace, the more faithfully it appears to use those traces during inference. Trace Truncation In this setting, we truncate the thinking trace at different points and observe how the final answer changes. If the model\u2019s answer re- mains unchanged despite the removal of reasoning steps, this suggests that the original trace may have been post-hoc or ignored during inference. Con- cretely, for each generated trace, we segment the reasoning steps into three equal parts and perform targeted truncations: removing the first part, the middle part, or the last part. We then compare the model\u2019s predictions under each truncated trace to those obtained with the full thinking trace. This setup allows us to identify not only whether trunca- tion affects predictions but also which part exerts the greatest influence across languages. Error Injection In this setting, we introduce a small error into the last sentence of the thinking trace \u2013 by altering a number involved in the final computation step (e.g., changing it to another num- ber). This design specifically targets the final stage of reasoning, where the model is expected to derive or summarize the correct answer. The goal is to assess whether the model relies on the correctness of the concluding reasoning step. If the model\u2019s answer changes in response to this minimal per- turbation, it suggests that it is faithfully using its own reasoning. On the other hand, if the answer remains unchanged, despite the final reasoning step being incorrect, this may indicate that the model is ignoring its stated trace or relying on earlier steps, memorized patterns, or even contamination instead. 6.2 Results and Discussion Table 2 reports the change in final-answer accuracy for each language on the MGSM dataset under two perturbation strategies \u2013 last-part truncation and error injection \u2013 in the HackSub setting. Figure 4 further visualizes the effect of truncating the first, middle, and last segments of the thinking trace across models in the DeepSeek-R1 distilled series.

In contrast, many languages experience substantial accuracy drops, suggesting that models do rely on their thinking traces to varying extents. This is further supported by our matching ratio re- sults in Table 3, which measure how often the final predictions are influenced by the incorrect numbers injected into the trace.

Higher values suggest stronger reliance on the surface form of the reasoning. R1-Qwen-32B) compared with other languages. Truncating the final part is less disruptive than error injection, especially for R1 distilled mod- els. Across all languages, we find that truncating the final segment of the thinking trace has less im- pact than injecting an incorrect value, particularly for the R1 distilled series.5 This suggests that mod- els may perform latent-state reasoning (Zhu et al., 2025), where inference continues internally even after the visible thinking trace is truncated. How- ever, when a plausible but incorrect final value is injected, models often copy it directly, revealing that their outputs are sensitive to surface-level rea- soning conclusions. Model scale affects faithfulness behavior. As shown in Figure 4, model scale influences how dif- ferent parts of the thinking trace affect predictions. Smaller models are more reliant on the final portion of the trace, aligning with their higher matching ratios (cf. Table 3), suggesting a higher degree of surface-level faithfulness. Larger models, by con- trast, become less dependent on the final segments 5Interestingly, the Qwen3 models show the opposite trend. We hypothesize that this may be due to data contamination, as seen in Table 3, where these models rarely change their answers even when the final sentence is corrupted. and more sensitive to earlier reasoning steps. This may indicate either (1) reduced faithfulness due to memorization or contamination, or (2) stronger latent-state reasoning capabilities that allow the model to recover from truncated traces or correct surface-level trace errors. Summary. Our findings reveal that models vary in their faithfulness across languages and model scales. Languages other than English show stronger reliance on thinking traces. Truncating the final part of the trace is generally less disruptive than injecting incorrect information, especially for R1 distilled models, possibly suggesting latent-state reasoning. Larger models are less dependent on surface-level reasoning and more resilient to per- turbations, though this may reflect either increased reasoning ability or memorization. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multilingual CoT reasoning across a diverse", "for R1 distilled models, possibly suggesting latent-state reasoning. Larger models are less dependent on surface-level reasoning and more resilient to per- turbations, though this may reflect either increased reasoning ability or memorization. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multilingual CoT reasoning across a diverse set of LRMs. We examine three core dimen- sions, performance, consistency, and faithfulness, to provide a deeper understanding of how LRMs reason across languages. We show that LRMs exhibit strong language preferences in reasoning and that final-answer performance varies substan- tially across languages. Through our crosslingual thinking trace interchanging method, we show that thinking traces are often inconsistent across lan- guages, with their quality strongly associated with the thinking language. Finally, our perturbation- based tests reveal that models rely on the traces to varying degrees, suggesting that reasoning faith- fulness is uneven across languages. Our findings highlight the need for more robust and transparent evaluation of multilingual reasoning behavior. Limitations While our work provides the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, we acknowl- edge that several limitations remain. First, although we examine robustness through two perturbation strategies and show that robust- ness varies across languages, more sophisticated or adversarial perturbations (e.g., paraphrasing, dis- tractor reasoning) remain unexplored and could be incorporated in future work. Second, while we evaluate and analyze inconsis- tencies in multilingual reasoning, we do not pro- vide a mechanistic explanation for why these in- consistencies arise. Future research could apply mechanistic interpretability methods to investigate model internals to better understand the sources of multilingual inconsistency and faithfulness. Finally, due to resource constraints, our exper- iments are limited in the number of models and downstream tasks considered. Future work could extend our evaluation framework to a broader set of models, languages, and tasks.

In particular, accuracy drops are most pronounced in low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili, Telugu, Bengali), whereas high-resource languages (e.g., English, German, French, Chinese) show relatively stable performance across both con- trol strategies. A.1.2 Consistency of Final-answer Figures 5 and 6 show the consistency results on MMMLU and MGSM of LRMs. Across both tasks, the scaling trend remains stable: larger models ex- hibit higher consistency. However, we also observe that applying prompt hacking tends to affect the in- ternal language consistency of models, sometimes reducing alignment compared to explicit instruc- tions. A.1.3 Language Compliance Table 6 and Table 7 report sentence-level and token-level compliance statistics on MMMLU and MGSM. Overall, prompt hacking improves align- ment with the target language, with stronger effects for low-resource languages. Token-level compli- ance is consistently lower than sentence-level com- pliance, likely due to the difficulty of identifying language from individual tokens and the presence of borrowings or quoted words within sentences. Table 8 and Table 9 present the proportions of Chinese and English content in the reasoning traces across different models and prompt lan- guages. We observe that, under explicit instruction, models tend to default to English traces even when prompted in another language, with Chinese traces also appearing but less frequently. Prompt hack- ing can reduce this misalignment by shifting the distribution toward the target language. A.2 Complete Results for Interchanging Thinking traces Figure 7 shows the accuracy of R1-Qwen mod- els on MGSM with interchanged reasoning traces. Injecting traces from low-resource languages into high-resource prompts lowers performance, while high-resource traces can boost low-resource prompts. This confirms the strong influence of rea- soning trace quality on final accuracy. Figure 8 shows that consistency with original setup after substitution is generally higher between similar languages. HackSub follows the same trend as BaseSub but sometimes lowers cross-language con- sistency, especially for low-resource languages.

Indo-European languages generally achieve higher consistency, and the differences are sta- tistically significant. removing the final part leads to larger performance drops, highlighting the importance of the conclud- ing reasoning steps. B Details of Datasets B.1 Language Coverage Table 12 summarizes the language coverage of the two datasets used in our experiments: MMMLU and MGSM. B.2 Test Instances To reduce computational costs, we limit each dataset to a maximum of 250 test instances per language. For MMMLU, we randomly sample 250 examples from the full 14K test set. This sampling is applied consistently across all parallel language versions to ensure comparability. For MGSM, we use the official test set, which consists of 250 par- allel examples available across all supported", "250 test instances per language. For MMMLU, we randomly sample 250 examples from the full 14K test set. This sampling is applied consistently across all parallel language versions to ensure comparability. For MGSM, we use the official test set, which consists of 250 par- allel examples available across all supported lan- guages. B.3 Prompt Templates Table 9 provides an overview of the prompts de- signed for model instruction. However, we ob- served that, even when explicit prompts were pro- vided, the model frequently conducted its inter- mediate reasoning in a language different from that of the input prompt. To mitigate this incon- sistency, we appended the language-specific in- structions listed in Table 13 after the query and the <think> tag. This strategy effectively enforces the model to align its reasoning language with the prompt language. To avoid redundancy, we present prompt templates for the MGSM task in Table 9 only, while templates for MMMLU share the same structural format and are available in the released code. C Experimental Environment and Hyperparameters We set the maximum generation length to 8192 tokens for all models. We use the recommended configurations provided on HuggingFace for all models. Specifically, we set the temperature to 0.6 and top-p to 0.95 for distilled versions of DeepSeek R1. For Qwen3 models, we set the temperature to 0.6, top-p to 0.95, and top-k to 20. Experiments are primarily conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. For larger models, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, we use NVIDIA H200 GPUs for inference. To evaluate final-answer correctness, we adopt an exact matching strategy.

We flip this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To this end, we present WUGNEC- TIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs\u2019 inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most con- nectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs\u2019 overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a con- cessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https:// github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives 1 Introduction Discourse connectives such as but, moreover, al- though, because, etc., are central to producing and comprehending natural language. As such, the task of successfully predicting a discourse connec- tive, given two discourse arguments has been popu- lar throughout computational linguistics research (Zhou et al., 2010; Biran and McKeown, 2013; Pat- terson and Kehler, 2013), having made its way to the evaluation of large language models (Pandia et al., 2021; Beyer et al., 2021). For instance, the connective that links (1a) to (1b) linearly is likely to be because rather than although. (1) a. I prefer Dubai to New York. b. I hate snowy winters. Previous work: Using context + world knowledge to make predictions about discourse connectives. This work: Using context + knowledge of discourse connectives to infer about new entities in the world. Figure 1: Past work has largely focused on the predic- tion of connectives given some input context, usually requiring access to world knowledge. We reduce this reliance by using novel entities, and analyze whether LMs can rely on their knowledge of the connectives themselves to make inferences about the world. Prediction of the correct connective in the above example primarily requires consulting one\u2019s world knowledge\u2014that Dubai does not have snowy win- ters (while New York does), and therefore (1b) can be a reason for why the speaker prefers Dubai over New York. There has been a history of using such knowledge to predict discourse relations in the ab- sence of an explicit cue (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Biran and McK- eown, 2013; Li and Nenkova, 2014; Rutherford and Xue, 2014; Braud and Denis, 2015). This paper studies the inverse problem: what kind of inferences can one make about the enti- ties, given the discourse connective? If one were to instead consider (2), which replaces Dublin", "al., 2009; Biran and McK- eown, 2013; Li and Nenkova, 2014; Rutherford and Xue, 2014; Braud and Denis, 2015). This paper studies the inverse problem: what kind of inferences can one make about the enti- ties, given the discourse connective? If one were to instead consider (2), which replaces Dublin and New York with novel entities, X and Y, then de- pending on the connective used, one could draw different inferences about what X and Y could be. (2) a. I prefer X to Y. b. I hate snowy winters. arXiv:2510.09556v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 For instance, if we were to use because, then one could infer that X does not have snowy winters. On the other hand, if we use however, then this infer- ence is reversed\u2014that despite hating snowy win- ters the speaker prefers X (over Y). In this manner, discourse connectives can serve as cues to mean- ing/world knowledge (Elman, 2004). In many ways, modern LLMs have been re- garded as models that have finally \u201cgrasped\u201d lan- guage (Piantadosi, 2023; Futrell and Mahowald, 2025). Their use of discourse connectives in mod- ern AI-generated writing has similarly progressed far from older LMs (Ko and Li, 2020). But there is a difference between being able to use connectives correctly given known properties of concepts in- volved, v.s. fully understand their functional mean- ing and making correct inferences (Mahowald et al., 2024). We ask: to what extent do LMs make abstract inferences about novel entities as li- censed by connectives? Answering this question allows us to make fine-grained contributions to the broader goal of characterizing how well aspects of meaning\u2014in this case, attributes and relations of novel entities\u2014can be learned from language ex- posure (Gelman, 2004; Lupyan and Lewis, 2019). To answer this question, we propose WUGNEC- TIVES, a benchmark consisting of 740 utterances, each of which links novel entities to their attributes via the usage of specific discourse connectives. These utterances are embedded across 12 differ- ent prompt variations, amounting to 8,880 unique stimuli. Thus, while existing work focusing on discourse connectives effectively tests how world knowledge enables the prediction (or comprehen- sion) of discourse connectives, this work flips this premise, and instead investigates how specific con- nectives can inform the model about entities men- tioned in the arguments that the connectives oper- ates over. By removing the aspect of world knowl- edge that is likely entrenched in a language model (LM)\u2019s parameters, our investigation sheds light on whether LMs learn the abstract functional meaning of these connectives, in a manner that is indepen- dent of the content of the arguments they connect. WUGNECTIVES consists of stimuli for 41 unique connective-forms, spanning 7 different senses, across a total of 3 different stimuli types, each fo- cusing on different kinds of knowledge about novel entities\u2014e.g., instantiation/category membership, temporal relations, and general attributes of entities such as \u201cbeing an island nation\u201d. Using WUGNEC- TIVES, we evaluate 17 different open-source LMs at various parameter sizes, and training types (base, instruction tuning, and reasoning-based tuning). We find LMs to show a great deal of variation", "about novel entities\u2014e.g., instantiation/category membership, temporal relations, and general attributes of entities such as \u201cbeing an island nation\u201d. Using WUGNEC- TIVES, we evaluate 17 different open-source LMs at various parameter sizes, and training types (base, instruction tuning, and reasoning-based tuning). We find LMs to show a great deal of variation in their abilities to infer about entities from con- nective usage. LMs generally performed above chance on cases where connectives expressed tem- poral meaning between novel events, or provided causal evidence for an entity\u2019s attributes (or lack thereof), and in some limited cases, when they expressed instantiation relations between entities. However, they consistently obtained chance-level performance on connectives that expressed con- cession between arguments\u2014i.e., when a causal expectation raised on the basis of one argument is denied by the other. The systematicity of our results on such cases suggested that these classes of connectives (although, even though, despite that, etc.) pose a fundamental difficulty for LMs to rea- son about the semantic features of novel entities in context. Our results could not be explained by frequency of these connectives in internet corpora, suggesting a more nuanced, intractable reason at play. Finally, while we found no clear effect of scale or instruct-tuning, we did find reasoning- based tuning of LMs (\u00e1 la Guo et al., 2025) to be beneficial, achieving the best performance across all connective senses (though still struggling on concession). Taken together, our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigation into the func- tional meanings of language cues, complementing traditional analyses of usage. 2 Background By investigating LMs on their functional knowl- edge of discourse connectives to infer about the world, our work brings together two bodies of work in modern computational linguistics: Modeling Connectives Discourse connectives, e.g., \u201cbecause\u201d, \u201chowever\u201d, etc., are a class of words that mark the discourse (coherence) rela- tions between two arguments, often unambigu- ously (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009). The role of world knowledge contained in the arguments of a relation has been of particular significance in prior work on recognizing implicit discourse re- lations. While this was initially signified using cartesian products of words in arguments (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), there was widespread op- erationalization of this premise in several works since the introduction of the Penn Discourse Tree- bank (PDTB; Prasad et al., 2017)\u2014e.g., Pitler et al. (2009); Lin et al. (2009); Zhou et al. (2010); Bi- ran and McKeown (2013); Patterson and Kehler (2013); Li and Nenkova (2014); Rutherford and Xue (2014); Braud and Denis (2015). Braud and Denis (2016) first showed evidence of improved discourse relation classification when word repre- sentations were informed by connectives. Previous work evaluating language models\u2019 un- derstanding of discourse connectives has largely focused on their ability to categorize, or predict connectives in context (Nie et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Koto et al., 2021). A number of works, such as Pandia et al. (2021), CoherenceGym (Beyer et al., 2021), and Cong et al. (2023) have evaluated LMs\u2019 sensitivity to infelici- tous usage of connectives. A common theme among these works is that world knowledge about the", "Kim et al., 2020; Koto et al., 2021). A number of works, such as Pandia et al. (2021), CoherenceGym (Beyer et al., 2021), and Cong et al. (2023) have evaluated LMs\u2019 sensitivity to infelici- tous usage of connectives. A common theme among these works is that world knowledge about the arguments being linked together is a necessary prerequisite to models\u2019 suc- cess. Our work abstracts away from this assump- tion by testing how connectives cue the meanings of the arguments that they link. Learning about the world from Language (mod- els) LMs offer an interesting avenue to investi- gate questions about how language exposure can give rise to semantic knowledge\u2014a subject that has always received great theoretical interest (Lan- dau and Gleitman, 1985; Waxman and Markow, 1995; Elman, 2004; Gelman, 2004; Lupyan and Lewis, 2019). Grounded in this motivation, a num- ber of previous works have aimed to characterize the kinds of world knowledge that arises in LMs (Abdou et al., 2021; Misra et al., 2023; Ivanova et al., 2024, i.a.). While these works serve as cat- alogs of what kinds of world knowledge can be acquired from language exposure, the status of the cues that can give rise to them is less clear. Our work presents a step in this direction. By using connectives to link arguments involving \u201cnovel\u201d entities, we center our focus on treating their func- tion as the primary cue that LMs must rely on (in tandem with other parts of the input context) to reason about the entities\u2019 attributes and relations. 3 Designing WUGNECTIVES In this section we describe the design decisions for WUGNECTIVES\u2014in terms of how we opera- tionalize \u201cnovel information\u201d, type of inference, and choice of connectives, finally culminating in our description of the stimuli. Entity type Surface forms Bare plurals Wugs, Daxes, Feps, Geks, Blickets Events Wugfest, Daxday, Fepfestival, Gextravaganza, Blicketbash Locations Wugsville, Daxburgh, Fepopolis, Gektopia, Blicketland Table 1: Lists of nonce words used in our stimuli. Nonce words To operationalize \u2018novel informa- tion\u2019 we use nonce words as novel entities in ut- terances expressing a proposition from which the LM has to infer their attributes (e.g., is a leafy vegetable) or their relations to another novel en- tity (e.g., Wugs are Daxes). The usage of nonce words for reasoning has now become commonplace in computational linguistics research (Misra et al., 2023; Eisenschlos et al., 2023; Rodriguez et al., 2025), and has been a longstanding tradition in cognitive psychology to mimic a scenario where the learner has little, if any, knowledge of the enti- ty/property in question (Osherson et al., 1990; Gel- man et al., 2010). Following Misra et al. (2023), we use pairs of nonce words in our stimuli, primarily due to two reasons. First, a number of our chosen connectives (see below) describe relations between two entities, and therefore, to maintain uniformity we use two novel entities throughout. Second, us- ing two nonce words creates a notion of choice, and prevents the scenario where the LM simply uses co- occurrence information to make judgments about the only novel entity in question. Importantly,", "describe relations between two entities, and therefore, to maintain uniformity we use two novel entities throughout. Second, us- ing two nonce words creates a notion of choice, and prevents the scenario where the LM simply uses co- occurrence information to make judgments about the only novel entity in question. Importantly, we counterbalance our nonce words throughout, to en- sure that a systematic bias towards any one surface form leads to poor performance. Our novel entities range from events (for temporal connectives), to simple bare plurals (for instantiation, comparison, and contingency connectives) to locations (for com- parison and contingency connectives). See Table 1 for the full list of nonce words. Inference type The specific class of inferences we focus on are entailments, which means the cor- rect answer is true regardless of the properties of the entities tested, allowing us to evaluate on infer- ences regardless of the characteristics of the nonce words used. We use these entailments to opera- tionalize the notion of ground truth for all stimuli. Connectives and relation senses We select a subset of relations from PDTB (Prasad et al., 2017) to build our stimuli from the following level 2 senses: Expansion.Instantiation, Continge ncy.Cause, Comparison.Concession, and Temp oral.Asynchronous. A full list of the third-level senses and connectives can be found in Table 2. Stimuli Type Target Properties Sense Count Connectives Instantiation is a Expansion.Instantiation. Arg2-as-instance 100 for example, for instance, in particular, specifically, such as Preference are leafy vegetables, are mammals, are fruits, are string instruments, are insects, is an island, is a college town, is a coastal city, has mountains nearby, has an equatorial climate Contingency.Cause.Reason 160 as, because, for, since Contingency.Cause.Result 240 as a result, for example, for instance, so, therefore, thus Comparison.Concession.

Note: connectives that repeat are either poly-functional (e.g., while because is primarily a Contingency connective, it can also have Temporal senses), or have subtly different level 3 senses\u2014e.g., whether although appears in the clause with the preference (\u201cI prefer wugs to daxes\u201d) or a property (\u201cI hate leafy vegetables\u201d) changes its Comparison.Concession sense).

Stimuli Design Each individual stimulus consists of two parts: a premise and inference. The premise is a sentences which uses a discourse connective to specify the relation between two nonce words. The inference is either an explicit formulation of that entailed relation, it\u2019s logical opposite, i.e, a contra- diction. Models are prompted with each inference framed as a question, and must respond appropri- ately based on whether the inference is entailed or contradictory. We categorize these stimuli into three families based on the types of inferences they license: Temporal, Instantiation, and Preference. Instantiation: The connectives in these stim- uli describe the is-a relationship between two dis- course entities. Stimuli of this type follow the form of sentence (3), and systematically entail sentences in the form of (4). (3) I like wugs, for example, daxes are nice. (4) Daxes are wugs. We used five Expansion.Instantiation.Arg2- as-instance connectives in these stimuli. Preference: Here, connectives describe the rela- tionship between a speaker\u2019s preferred entity and a liked or disliked property. These inferences can either be causal or concessive, in which case the licensed inferences respectively arise because of or in spite of expectations raised by the premise. For the purposes of stimuli design, connectives in this category are most saliently organized by their level- 2 senses, Contingency.Cause (like because) and Comparison.Concession (like although).1 For example, both (5a) and (5b) entail (6). (5) a. Because I love leafy vegetables, I prefer wugs to daxes. b. Although I hate leafy vegetables, I prefer wugs to daxes. (6) Wugs are leafy vegetables. Additionally, the use of \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018hate\u2019 can be swapped to change the polarity of the entailment. That is, the first nonce2 will not have the property, as in (7a) and (7b), both of which entail (8).3 1However, there is variety among third-level senses. See Table 2 for more details. 2Inferences about the second entity\u2019s relation to the prop- erty, while occasionally salient, are indeterminate in their entailment status and were subject of much debate amongst the authors. We do not make any claims about whether or not these inferences are implicatures or entailments, and leave them out of our dataset. 3Notably, this being an entailment rather than an implica- (7) a. Because I hate leafy vegetables, I prefer wugs to daxes. b. Although I love leafy vegetables, I prefer wugs to daxes. (8) Wugs are not fluffy creatures. The prompted questions regarding inferences where the nonce does not have the given prop- erty (such as (8)) are identical in form to those where they property applies, but the correct answer changes from \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cNo.\u201d This is the general form of preference stimuli, though a", "not fluffy creatures. The prompted questions regarding inferences where the nonce does not have the given prop- erty (such as (8)) are identical in form to those where they property applies, but the correct answer changes from \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cNo.\u201d This is the general form of preference stimuli, though a few other vari- ations of these stimuli are present as well. The pref- erence part of the dataset contains both fronted and non-fronted connectives, where naturally possible. Additionally, the connective can occur in the clause with the preference rather than the property while still licensing the same inference (e.g. \u201cAlthough I prefer wugs to daxes, I hate leafy vegetables.\u201d, which still entails (8)). Overall, we use 20 unique connectives for these stimuli, with 10 each in Contingency.Cause and C omparison.Concession senses (Table 2). We use a total of 10 unique entity properties\u20145 mapped to bare plurals, and 5 mapped to locations. Temporal: Here, connectives describe the tem- poral order of events. We include connectives from both Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence (9a) and Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession (9b). (9) a. Wugfest happened even before Daxday took place. b. Daxday happened once Wugfest took place. Both sentences (9a) and (9b) entail (10). (10) Wugfest started before Daxday. More explicitly, Precedence connectives license inferences where the entity in Arg1 starts before that in Arg2, and Succession connectives license inferences where the entity in Arg2 starts before Arg1. This does not directly map to the first en- tity linearly, as fronting the connective changes the order of the underlying arguments while preserv- ing the licensed inference, as in (11), which still ture depends on the property being most saliently organized into a binary category. Consider the following grounded exam- ple with a gradable property: \u201cAlthough I love tall buildings, I prefer Austin to New York.

(11) Once Wugfest took place, Daxday happened. Additionally, we randomly vary the verbs used to say that each event came to pass between happened, took place, and occurred. These verbs are neutral with respect to a start time, and the increased va- riety ensures both naturalistic stimuli and helps isolate connective-based pragmatic reasoning from over-reliance on the surface form. Unlike Instantia- tion and Preference stimuli, the inferences in this family are prompted in open-ended questions (e.g., \u201cWhich event started first?\u201d). Accordingly, this cat- egory does not contain contradictory inferences, and the responses we measure from models are the names of the two given events. We use a total of 24 temporal connectives, 12 each in Temporal.As ynchronous.Precedence and Temporal.Asynch ronous.Succession. Prompt Templates We embed our premise and inference pairs in 12 different prompt templates per stimuli type. Our templates are formatted in terms of a narrative dialogue where a named speaker says the premise, which is then followed by a ques- tion that targets the inference, and an instruction to guide the model to possible answers (Yes/No for Instantiation and Preference, or the name of one of the", "templates are formatted in terms of a narrative dialogue where a named speaker says the premise, which is then followed by a ques- tion that targets the inference, and an instruction to guide the model to possible answers (Yes/No for Instantiation and Preference, or the name of one of the two events for Temporal). Variation in our prompts are paraphrases of the questions\u2014e.g., re- placing \u201cFrom this, which event started first?\u201d with \u201cFrom what Erica said, which of the two events be- gan first?\u201d (see table 3). A detailed list of prompt templates is shown in table 5 and table 6 in the Appendix. After applying our prompt templates, we end up with a total of 8,880 stimuli. 4 Experimental Setup Models We evaluate on three primary model families: Qwen-2.5 (Yang et al., 2025), OLMo- 2 (Walsh et al., 2025), and Llama 3.1 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), across multiple different scales (when possible) in terms of parameter counts. For Qwen- 2.5, we evaluate at 5 different scales ranging from 500M\u201414B parameters, for OLMo-2 we evaluate its 1B and 7B variants, and for Llama 3.1, we evalu- ate on its 8B variant. For each model we include its instruct tuned as well as non-instruct tuned (which we refer to as \u201cbase\u201d) versions. Additionally we also evaluate on a distilled version of the DeepSeek R1 model (Guo et al., 2025), where the authors Instantiation Comparison Concession (Arg1) Comparison Concession (Arg2) Contingency Cause (Reason) Contingency Cause (Result) Temporal (Precedence) Temporal (Succession) 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% Parameters (in Billion), log-scale Accuracy (95% CI) Training Type base instruct reasoning Model Family Llama-3.1-8B Qwen2.5 Qwen2.5-DS OLMo-2 Figure 2: Accuracy of LMs across connective senses.

We refer to this model as Qwen2.5-DS. In total, we test on 17 models: 10 Qwen-2.5 LMs, 4 OLMo-2 LMs, 2 Llama LMs, and 1 Qwen2.5-DS LM. Table 7 (appendix) shows metadata of each model. Answer Extraction For Qwen2.5-DS, we prompt the LM to generate its responses and include its answer in the standard \\boxed{} format. There were a cases where the LM did not do this\u2014for these, we used the pipeline described in \u00a7G to extract predictions. For base and instruct tuned models, we extracted the answer following recent work (Rodriguez et al., 2025): in the case of preference and instantiation stimuli, since we had a Yes/No question in our stim- uli, we extracted the probabilities of a variety of surface forms for Yes and No (i.e., case variation and space prefixing), and normalized them to get the relative probabilities of \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No\u2019. We then chose the form with the greatest probability as the model\u2019s response.", "question in our stim- uli, we extracted the probabilities of a variety of surface forms for Yes and No (i.e., case variation and space prefixing), and normalized them to get the relative probabilities of \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No\u2019. We then chose the form with the greatest probability as the model\u2019s response. We performed the same pro- cess for our temporal stimuli, but instead restricted to retrieve the probabilities of the pair of \u2018Event\u2019 nonce words (see Table 1) in our stimuli. Measurement We primarily report accuracy as our main performance metric, calculated as the proportion of time the correct response was pro- duced by the model using our extraction strategy described above. Across all levels of our analy- ses (overall, per-sense, per connective, etc.), we report 95% confidence intervals across different prompt templates to jointly characterize the effect of prompt variation. Since in all cases we eval- uate models on their choice between two possi- ble answers (Yes/No for Preference and Instantia- tion stimuli, and between two entities for Temporal stimuli), chance accuracy is 50%.4 5 Results and Analysis We analyze our results along two main threads. We start by focusing on model performance by con- nective sense, diving deeper into salient patterns of model behavior on specific connectives or a class of connectives. We then turn to analyses that focus on external artifacts such as model scale, factors involved in the models\u2019 training regimen such as in- struct tuning, or training models to perform reason- ing (in the sense of DeepSeek-R1), and an analysis of model performance vs. connective frequency. Our main results across all these variables, broken down by sense, is shown in Figure 2. 5.1 By Discourse Sense Only a few LMs captured entailments licensed by connectives across various senses. While LMs gen- erally had above-chance accuracies on Temporal, Contingency, and in some cases, Instantiatio n connectives, they consistently struggled on Con cession, suggesting a systematic lack of abstract understanding of this particular sense. Below we discuss more detailed results per sense: Instantiation Apart from a select few cases (i.e., Qwen-2.5 models at or above 7B parameters), most LMs were at chance performance on Instantiation connectives, with the Qwen2.5-DS model perform- ing the best (at 82% accuracy). Figure 3 shows results of models broken down by connective. We observe a notable amount of variation across in- stantiation connectives, with models particularly struggling on for instance (avg. accuracy of 53%) and for example (avg. accuracy of 63%). 4For temporal stimuli, we counterbalance the nonce words across all possible pairs such that a bias towards one will result in chance performance. 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% for example for instance in particular specifically such as Connective Accuracy Training Type base instruct reasoning Model Family Llama-3.1-8B Qwen2.5 Qwen2.5-DS OLMo-2 Figure 3: Mean accuracy (across prompts) of models by connective for the sense Expansion.Instantiation.

Concession All LMs in our experiments obtained chance-level performance on Concession connec- tives (Comparison.Concession). That is, they seem to fundamentally struggle to infer entailments in cases where the function of the connective is to cancel or deny a causal relation expressed in one of the arguments. We observe this for both types of concession senses (Arg1-a s-denier as well as Arg2-as-denier), suggest- ing a generally robust trend. Among various in- dividual connectives, LMs seemed to especially struggle at although and even though when they are fronted (e.g., \u201cAlthough I hate fluffy creatures, I prefer wugs to daxes.\u201d, where although is used in an Arg1-as-denier sense), oftentimes even ob- taining below-chance performance. See Figure 5 for a full breakdown. In fact, models appear to struggle with concession connectives so much so that this seems to transfer over to when they are used in a different sense. Evidence for this is shown in Figure 4, where we see that the performance of the top performing LMs on succession connectives is compellingly greater than that on the succession sense of \u201ceven though\u201d, a connective that also has a concession sense. This reinforces the finding of LMs\u2019 notable weakness on concession connectives. Contingency Models are generally better on con- tingency connectives than on the previous two, with 13/17 models being at least 5 percentage points above chance on both types of contingency con- nectives. At the same time, they are considerably far from perfect, with only the Qwen2.5-DS model showing accuracies above 75% for both senses. Temporal Models showed largely inconsistent behavior in their performance on Temporal con- nectives, especially when observing the changes between their performance in the Precedence vs. Precedence Succession Choose-first 92.5% 56.4% Choose-recent 7.5% 43.6% Table 4: Performance of positional-based heuristics. Choose-first linearly selects the first entity, and choose- recent selects the latest entity. Succession senses. A few exceptions to this trends were the Qwen2.5-DS model as well as larger vari- ants of the instruction tuned Qwen-2.5 and OLMo models. In all other cases, models showed the great- est variability in their performance relative to that on other closely related senses discussed before. One explanation for this variability can come from reasoning about shallow heuristics a system might potentially rely on in \u201csolving\u201d the inference problem in these stimuli. Here we shed light on two such heuristics, both heavily dependent on linear position of entities in the LMs\u2019 input: 1) Choose- First: select the first entity in the premise as the answer, and 2) Choose-Recent: select the most re- cent entity in the premise. These heuristics do not have the same impact on the two Temporal senses, as seen from their accuracies in Table 4, suggest- ing different levels of difficulty for the two types of stimuli. For Precedence stimuli, applying the Choose-first heuristic can result in perfect perfor- mance for almost all connectives. This is because, except for 2 connectives (before, and even before), none of the other 10 Precedence connectives can be fronted\u2014i.e., they always have to follow the same", "the two types of stimuli. For Precedence stimuli, applying the Choose-first heuristic can result in perfect perfor- mance for almost all connectives. This is because, except for 2 connectives (before, and even before), none of the other 10 Precedence connectives can be fronted\u2014i.e., they always have to follow the same linear order of {event1} <connective> {event2}, and so simply extracting {event1} can result in the appearance of sophisticated reason- ing. Since most Succession connectives can eas- ily be fronted, neither heuristic seems to have a non-trivial role to play. Overall, it is difficult to de- termine if these heuristics are borne out in the LMs we analyzed, unless we perform a causal analysis of their mechanisms (Geiger et al., 2021), which we leave for future work. 5.2 By external artifacts In general, frequency alone does not explain the variance in the model\u2019s performance, and there were no clear effects of scale or instruct tuning. Though preliminary, we did find reasoning-based tuning (i.e., the manner in which Qwen2.5-DS was tuned) to consistently show stronger performance, with the exception on Concession connectives as discussed in the previous subsection. Below we Q-2.5-14B Q-2.5-14B-I Q-2.5-3B-I Q-2.5-7B-I Q-2.5-14B-DS 40% 60% 80% 100% Rest of Succession Even though Condition Accuracy (95% CI) Figure 4: Accuracy of top five models on succession stimuli without even though compared with their perfor- mance on even though.

We make use of linear-mixed effects regression for our analysis of Scale, Instruction-Tuning, and Reasoning-based tuning, and report overall results here, while leav- ing particular details of the analysis in \u00a7F. Frequency of Connective While discourse con- nectives are generally quite frequent in corpora, to what extent does their frequency relate to LMs\u2019 be- havior in capturing their licensed inferences? To test this, we extract frequencies of our 41 unique connectives from Dolma corpus (Soldaini et al., 2024), and measure their correlation with LMs\u2019 performance per connective. We do not find a sig- nificant correlation between frequency and model performance (see Table 8 in the Appendix).5 Scale Overall, we do not find any notable, global effect of scale in our results. In many cases, larger models of the same family were no different than their smaller counterparts, a finding that was preva- lent especially for the OLMo and Llama fami- lies), while in other cases there were only selective instances of a clear effect of scale\u2014e.g., Qwen- 2.5 Instruct models on Precedence and Qwen-2.5 base models on Succession. Results from lin- ear mixed-effects regression analysis with an in- teraction term for number of parameters and sense as fixed effects, with random effects for model and prompt templates corroborated our findings (\u03b2params = 0.008, p = .10). Instruction Tuning Instruction-tuned models barely showed any improvements over their base 5As a caveat, it is intractable to track what sense of a connective was being used in a corpus as large as Dolma, and therefore these frequencies can be seen as the estimates for the upper-bound of those used in their actual,", "models barely showed any improvements over their base 5As a caveat, it is intractable to track what sense of a connective was being used in a corpus as large as Dolma, and therefore these frequencies can be seen as the estimates for the upper-bound of those used in their actual, precise senses. counterparts. There were scattered exceptions to this trend\u2014e.g., OLMo 2 1B on Contingency connectives, Qwen-2.5-500M on Precedence con- nectives (though the opposite effect was found in Succession), most Qwen-2.5 models and OLMo 2 7B on Succession connectives. However, due to the absence of a consistent pattern, it is not yet clear if instruction tuning shows any particular benefit in the context of making inferences from discourse connective usages. A linear mixed-effects regres- sion analysis using an interaction between sense and instruction tuning (coded as a binary fixed- effect\u20141 if present, 0 otherwise), to predict accu- racy, with random effects for prompt template and model yields results consistent with this conclusion (\u03b2instruct = \u22120.004, p = .826). Reasoning-based Tuning While we did not have as many cases of \u201cReasoning-based\u201d tuning (in the sense of DeepSeek-R1) as we did Instruction Tuning, we do find evidence\u2014preliminary though it might be\u2014of reasoning-based tuning improv- ing models\u2019 abilities to make novel entity infer- ences from discourse connectives. The Qwen2.5- DS model consistently outperformed its base and instruction tuning variants in all except the conces- sion class of connectives. A linear-mixed effects regression analysis on results from all three vari- ants of Qwen 2.5 14B (base, instruct, reasoning), with an interaction between training type and sense, and random effects of prompt template yielded cor- roborating evidence (\u03b2reasoning vs. base = 0.06, p < .001; \u03b2reasoning vs. instruct = 0.08, p < .001). 6 Conclusion We present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset that sheds light on LMs\u2019 ability to reason about their knowl- edge discourse connectives in order to make in- ferences about novel entities. In doing so, we complement a long-standing body of work that has primarily treated connectives\u2014rather than world knowledge\u2014as the main target of prediction. While we pursued a number of different analyses, our most salient conclusion was about all tested models\u2019 systematic failure on concession connec- tives. In addition, we failed to find any effect of connective frequency, scaling, or even instruction tuning on LMs\u2019 performance, though there was preliminary evidence in favor of reasoning-based tuning, opening up future analyses of the linguis- tic properties of \u201creasoning models\u201d (Guo et al., 2025). Overall, we advocate for more investigations into the functional meanings of even the most simplest of linguistic cues, to fully catalog how language exposure enables semantic learning. 7 Limitations There are a number of limitations to this work: Reliance on connective alone While our aim in this work is to isolate\u2014to the extent that we can\u2014the reliance of LMs to the connectives alone and make inferences about the \u201cworld\u201d, our stimuli are not fully devoid of non-connective meaning. That is, LMs must still have to critically rely on the meanings of other words in the context (e.g., \u2018love\u2019, \u2019hate\u2019, \u2019prefer\u2019 in the case", "that we can\u2014the reliance of LMs to the connectives alone and make inferences about the \u201cworld\u201d, our stimuli are not fully devoid of non-connective meaning. That is, LMs must still have to critically rely on the meanings of other words in the context (e.g., \u2018love\u2019, \u2019hate\u2019, \u2019prefer\u2019 in the case of preference stim- uli). Fully teasing apart non-connective meanings is nearly impossible, so we relied on the assump- tion that models can consistently reason over these. Gradability of properties Another key assump- tion we\u2019ve made in the preference stimuli is that the properties in question are non-gradable (to ar- gue that we\u2019ve captured entailments rather than implicatures\u2014which are much easily cancelable). While this might be true for certain properties (e.g., is an island, is a college town, it is up for debate if any property is truly binary. At the same time, there is active discussion about whether category membership and \u201cgoodness of exemplar\u201d/typicality (the metric people use to argue that a property is graded, e.g., a platypus is less \u201cmammal-like\u201d than bear) are separate attributes of categories (Hamp- ton, 2007), with category membership being more binary-like than typicality. How novel are our novel words? Since we are using surface forms whose subtokens exist in the LMs\u2019 vocabulary, it is difficult to truly deem the full word as a \u201cnovel\u201d word. One solution is to in- sert novel tokens, though using them requires one to fine-tune the model, which makes our analysis especially intractable, since we do not necessarily have contexts to train the model on. Furthermore, we have counterbalanced our nonce words in our stimuli such that any particular bias a model might have picked up on will result in chance level perfor- mance. We have additionally verified that models do not necessarily do this in the concession results, ruling out the possibility that they are failing due to a particular bias in their embedding space for these words. Caveats in model comparison A caveat to the takeaway that reasoning models like Qwen2.5-DS are better is that it is non-trivial to directly compare across the three classes (base, instruct, reasoning), since the Qwen2.5-DS is expected to produce a set of reasoning traces before generating its output whereas models in the other two classes are directly queried for answers. Larger models While we do not test larger mod- els, we have been careful in drawing conclusions in our work, sticking to the set of models tested here. Since WUGNECTIVES is model agnostic, we will open our benchmark to anyone who wishes to test a model on it. We consider 17 models, with the kinds of variance in properties we have, to be a reasonable number of models to test.

To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication. \u2217Equal Contribution Corresponding Author Date: Oct. 11, 2025 Project Website: https://yzweak.github.io/autopr.github.io Code Repository: https://github.com/LightChen2333/AutoPR Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/yzweak/AutoPR Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/yzweak/PRBench Contact: qgchen@ir.hit.edu.cn, zyan@ir.hit.edu.cn,car@ir.hit.edu.cn, lbqin@csu.edu.cn 1. Introduction Large-scale pretrained AI models have recently advanced automated reasoning in academic settings, fueling AI4Research applications and a marked rise in scholarly assistant [11, 12, 19, 62]. Therefore, as shown in Figure 1 (a), the number of accepted conference papers has increased sharply [55, 3]. With this surge, researchers cannot feasibly track all relevant papers across conferences [43, 20].

The details of citation trend analysis are shown in Appendix A. more efficiently, readers increasingly rely on social media and digital platforms to keep up with current developments [34, 31, 16]. Meanwhile, authors proactively promote their work to expand visibility, attract citations, and increase influence [14, 24, 42]. However, as shown in Figure 1 (b), without promotion (PR), both influence and citations decline [6, 54], yet producing high-quality promotion materials still depends on manual effort and substantial time and cost (see Figure 1 (c)) [18, 40]. Recently, intelligent agent systems, which make autonomous decisions and adapt actions, have shown promise in academic contexts [28, 22, 53]. By automating research-promotion tasks such as generating concise summaries, designing visual abstracts, and conducting targeted promotion, these agents can increase the visibility and impact of scholarly work while reducing human effort [38, 48, 58]. However, a systematic benchmark for automated academic promotion on social platforms is still lacking. Current research offers neither a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on end-to-end promotion tasks nor complete pipelines for transforming academic papers into effective multimodal promotion materials. To fill this research gap, as illustrated in Figure 1 (d), we first introduce a novel task, AutoPR, which automatically generates academic promotion content. To support evaluation, we construct the Academic Promotion Benchmark (PRBench), which links 512 peer-reviewed articles across disciplines with curated multimodal promotion materials. We systematically assess agent performance along three dimensions: (i) Fidelity: producing accurate, persuasive content with proper tone and length; (ii) Engagement: identifying and involving stakeholders such as academic peers, journalists, and policymakers; and (iii) Alignment: timing dissemination based on audience behavior and channel dynamics. Our analysis of current agent frameworks reveals persistent limitations in contextual understanding and targeting precision for these tasks. To overcome these challenges and provide an end-to-end pipeline, as shown in Figure 1 (e), we further present PRAgent, a three-stage framework for scholarly promotion: (1) Content Extraction applies hierarchical 2 Text Content (\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc7b) Visual Content (\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc7d) \u2026 Supplementary Materials (\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc7a) Research Document (\ud835\udd3b) Quality Fidelity: Engagement: Alignment: Automatic Promotion ? ? ?

(2) Multi-Agent Content Synthesis uses a collaborative agent system to refine extracted information into polished outputs, transforming structured materials into coherent promotion-ready content. (3) Platform-Specific Adaptation models platform-specific preferences, allowing PRAgent to adjust tone and tagging to maximize user engagement. We evaluate PRAgent on the PRBench against standard LLM pipelines, showing much optimized content accuracy, engagement, and platform alignment. In real-world application, it shows a 604% increase in total watch time and a 438% increase in likes on real social media. These findings demonstrate PRAgent\u2019s effectiveness and chart a path toward automated scholarly communication. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Novel AutoPR Task: We first formalize automatic academic PR (AutoPR) as a distinct research task with systematic evaluation metrics. We scope it as translating peer-reviewed research into tailored promotional materials, specifying inputs (manuscripts, figures, key findings) and outputs (press releases, social media posts, visual abstracts). \u2022 PRBench Dataset: We present PRBench, a publicly released dataset of 512 paired multimodal samples linking peer-reviewed papers to their manually created PR posts across three AI-related fields, enabling rigorous end-to-end study of scholarly promotion. \u2022 PRAgent Framework: We introduce PRAgent, a three-stage framework integrating Content Extraction, Multi-Agent Content Synthesis, and Platform-Specific Adaptation. Experiments on PRBench show PRAgent outperforms traditional LLM pipelines aross almost all LLMs. In real-world tests, it yields up to a 6x increase in total watch time, a 4x increase in likes. 2. Task: AutoPR Here, we provide formal definition for Automatic Promotion (AutoPR) task. As shown in Figure 2, the objective is to automatically generate promotional content from a research document, optimized for a specific audience and dissemination platform. Formally, a source research document D = (DT, DV, DS) consists of the full text content DT; a set of visual content DV = {(v1, c1), (v2, c2), . . . , (vn, cn)}, where each pair (vi, ci) consists of a visual (e.g., figure, table) and its corresponding caption; any supplementary materials DS. The dissemination target consists of two components: TP is the target dissemination platform (e.g., Twitter, RedNote) and TA is the intended audience (e.g., academic peers, general public). The task is to generate a promotional post P, which is a composition of text and visual elements tailored to the dissemination 3 target. The generation process can be modeled as: \u02c6P = argmax P Pr(P | D, TP, TA). (1)", "is the intended audience (e.g., academic peers, general public). The task is to generate a promotional post P, which is a composition of text and visual elements tailored to the dissemination 3 target. The generation process can be modeled as: \u02c6P = argmax P Pr(P | D, TP, TA). (1) The goal of this task is to find an optimal post \u02c6P by simultaneously maximizing multiple objectives. This is a multi-objective optimization problem, as the core objectives are often in tension with one another. We define the objective function \u20d7F(P) as: max \u02c6P \u20d7F(P) = max \u02c6P {\ufe00 \u03b11SFidelity( \u02c6P | D) + \u03b12SAlign( \u02c6P | TP) + \u03b13SEngage( \u02c6P | TA) }\ufe00 (2) where the SFidelity(P | D) measures the factual accuracy and completeness of the post P with respect to the source research document D; SAlign(P | TP) evaluates how well the style, tone, and format of the post P align with the norms and best practices of the target platform TP; SEngage(P | TA) assesses the potential engagement of the post P to capture the attention of and resonate with the target audience TA. \u03b1i is a non-negative weight that controls the trade-offs between these objectives. 3. Benchmark: PRBench This section introduces the Academic Promotion Benchmark (PRBench), a novel benchmark for evaluating intelligent agents on the task of automated academic promotion. In this section, we detail its construction, the evaluation protocol used, and the specific metrics derived from this protocol. 3.1. Benchmark Construction The dataset was constructed through a three-stage process to ensure data quality, relevance, and utility for evaluating promotional agents. Step 1: Data Collection We first collected a corpus of papers from the arXiv repository submitted between June 2024 and June 2025, focusing on computer science subfields such as Computation & Language, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In parallel, we retrieved related promotion posts for these articles from two major social media platforms: Twitter (X) and RedNote. Step 2: Data Pairing and Curation To ensure all posts were human-authored, we first estimated their proportion of AI-generated content and excluded those with high AI likelihood. Next, we uniformly sampled 512 parallel pairs drawn from diverse sources and accounts. Each pair links a formal scientific artifact with its corresponding public-facing promotional material. The curation process required manual verification to ensure that each social media post directly promoted the associated arXiv paper. Each final pair includes both the research manuscript (PDF and metadata) and the promotional post (text and images). Step 3: Human Annotation and Quality Control To construct a reliable gold-standard ground truth, we implemented two expert-driven processes, with the full protocol detailed in Appendix B. (1) Annotation for Fidelity Evaluation: For each source paper, Gemini 2.5 Pro first generated a draft checklist of key factual points. A human expert then refined this checklist through corrections, additions, and deletions. Subsequently, three additional experts independently assigned importance weights from 1 (least critical) to 5 (most critical) to each fact. This procedure ensured both completeness and accurate representation of the paper\u2019s core contributions. (2) Annotation for Engagement and Alignment Evaluation: A", "expert then refined this checklist through corrections, additions, and deletions. Subsequently, three additional experts independently assigned importance weights from 1 (least critical) to 5 (most critical) to each fact. This procedure ensured both completeness and accurate representation of the paper\u2019s core contributions. (2) Annotation for Engagement and Alignment Evaluation: A panel of three experts independently annotated 512 authentic human-authored promotional posts. Each post was rated on a 0\u20135 scale according to the multi-dimensional criteria specified in Section 3.2. Small discrepancies (\u22641) were resolved through averaging, while larger discrepancies were settled by consensus deliberation. The resulting scores provide the ground truth for comparing LLM and human assessments of content quality. 4 3.2. Evaluation Metrics To systematically evaluate the numerous subjective attributes of social media posts, we assess the intrinsic quality of the post itself using a scoring system, and evaluate external human interests via preference scores(see Appendix C for the specific evaluation prompts). Fidelity Evaluation. Inspired by Sun et al. [48], Wu et al. [56], the fidelity score is an average of two sub-metrics to measure factual accuracy and completeness: (1) Authorship and Title Accuracy, which assesses whether the post accurately and prominently presents the authorship and title. (2) Factual Checklist Score. For a post P and source research document D, we create a weighted factual checklist C = {(c1, w1), . . . , (cn, wn) | D}. This checklist includes both fine-grained scientific claims and fundamental attribution facts. The Factual Checklist Score is calculated as: SChecklist(P | D) = \u2211\ufe00n i=1 wi \u00b7 v(P | ci, D) \u2211\ufe00n i=1 wi , (3) where v(P | ci, D) is the verdict from the LLM judge, a numerical score between 0 and 1. Alignment Evaluation. Informed by the theory of platform affordances which highlights the need for platform-specific strategies [39], alignment evaluation measures how well the generated content conforms to the norms and expectations of specific social media platforms TP. The sample\u2019s intrinsic alignment quality score is defined as the average rating across three criteria: (1) Contextual Relevance assesses the extent to which style, tone, and language align with platform norms and audience expectations. (2) Visual\u2013Text Integration evaluates the effectiveness of coordination between textual and visual elements for the specific platform. These two metrics are constructed under the influence of P2P [48]. (3) Hashtag and Mention Strategy examines the use of platform-specific hashtags and mentions to enhance reach and discoverability. The subjective preference alignment quality score is derived from the Platform Interest, in which the post P is evaluated against a reference post Pre f . This comparison simulates audience preferences to determine which post is more effective for platform-specific promotion and engagement. Engagement Evaluation. Drawing from communication studies that define social media success through user engagement [5], this evaluation assesses the potential of the generated content to attract and interact with target audience TA. The sample\u2019s intrinsic engagement score is the average rating across four criteria: (1) Engagement Hook Strength evaluates the effectiveness of the opening in capturing attention and generating interest. (2) Logical Attractiveness assesses the clarity and coherence of the", "of the generated content to attract and interact with target audience TA. The sample\u2019s intrinsic engagement score is the average rating across four criteria: (1) Engagement Hook Strength evaluates the effectiveness of the opening in capturing attention and generating interest. (2) Logical Attractiveness assesses the clarity and coherence of the narrative in conveying the core message. (3) Visual Attractiveness scrutinizes the originality, aesthetic value, and informational contribution of visual elements. (4) Call-To-Action (CTA) Score measures the effectiveness of guiding the audience toward a desired next deeper action (e.g., reading the paper). The subjective preference engagement score is defined as the average win rate in pairwise comparisons under two perspectives: (1) Professional Interest evaluates the effectiveness in conveying scientific novelty and value to peers. (2) Broader Interest assesses clarity and appeal to a scientifically literate wider audience. 4. Methodology: PRAgent PRAgent is a multi-agent framework for the autonomous transformation of academic papers into platform- specific social media posts. As illustrated in Figure 3, the PRAgent workflow employs specialized agents across three stages: (1) Content Extraction and Structuring, (2) Multi-Agent Content Synthesis, and (3) Platform-Specific Adaptation and Orchestration. The detailed prompts for each agent are provided in Appendix D. 5 Step3: Platform-Specific Adaptation Step2: Multi-Agent Content Synthesis Logical Draft Agent Step 1: Content Extraction Textual Enriching Agent Visual-Text-Interleaved Combination Agent Visual Content Preparation Agent Textual Content Extraction Agent Summarize Pairing Parse LayoutSeg PDF2Img Paired Visual Analysis Agent Platform Adaptation Packaging and Output Figure 3: overview of PRAgent, including: (1) Content extraction for preparing multimodal research material; (2) Multi-agent synthesis to transform structured data from Stage 1 into refined drafts; (3) Platform-specific adaptation to finalize the draft for publication. 4.1. Stage 1: Content Extraction The initial stage converts unstructured PDF research documents (D) into structured, machine-readable formats via parallel textual and visual content pipelines. 4.1.1. Textual Content Extraction Agent Due to frequent LLM context limitations, a structure-aware summarization strategy is applied by the Textual Content Extraction Agent: (1) Structural Parsing: The document D is first converted into intermediate HTML via PyMuPDF. Non-textual elements are then removed, and paragraph content is extracted, yielding the raw text Draw T . (2) Hierarchical Summarization: It condenses the body text by adaptive hierarchical summarization. Content within the LLM\u2019s context window undergoes a single-pass summary. Longer texts are processed hierarchically by section: each chunk is independently summarized and recursively combined layer-by-layer. This method is formalized as: Dsum T = Summarize(Parse(Draw T )), (4) where Summarize and Parse denotes the structural parsing and hierarchical summarization process described above, respectively. 4.1.2. Visual Content Preparation Agent The Visual Content Preparation Agent manages the visual pipeline, identifying and pairing figures and tables with their captions. (1) Image Conversion (PDF2Img): First, we render each source PDF page into a high-resolution (250 DPI) PNG image. (2) Layout Segmentation (LayoutSeg): We utilize DocLayout- YOLO [59] to perform layout analysis on each page image. This model detects bounding boxes for visual components (e.g., figure, table) and their captions. Detected components are subsequently cropped and saved. (3) Component Pairing (Pair): Then, we utilize a nearest-neighbor algorithm to associate visual", "Layout Segmentation (LayoutSeg): We utilize DocLayout- YOLO [59] to perform layout analysis on each page image. This model detects bounding boxes for visual components (e.g., figure, table) and their captions. Detected components are subsequently cropped and saved. (3) Component Pairing (Pair): Then, we utilize a nearest-neighbor algorithm to associate visual 6 elements with their captions and descriptions based on vertical proximity and a distance threshold. It yields a set of paired visual units, expressed as: Vpaired = Pair(LayoutSeg(PDF2Img(D))), (5) where Vpaired = {(v1, c1), (v2, c2), . . . , (vn, cn)}, with vi being an extracted visual element and ci its corre- sponding caption and description. 4.2. Stage 2: Multi-Agent Content Synthesis The core of our framework is a collaborative multi-agent system that synthesizes and adapts content, transforming structured data from Stage 1 into polished drafts. This system comprises four distinct agents: Logical Draft Agent, Visual Analysis Agent, Textual Enriching Agent, and Visual-Text-Interleaved Combination Agent. 4.2.1. Logical Draft Agent The Logical Draft Agent initiates content generation, converting summarized academic text (Dsum T ) into a structured, factually accurate, and style-agnostic draft (Ddra f t T ). Its operation is defined as: \u02c6Ddra f t T = Mtext(Ddra f t T |\u03c0dra f t, Dsum T ), (6) where Mtext is a textual generation LLM and \u03c0dra f t is the drafting prompt that enforces a strict output schema based on key analytical modules: (1) The Research Question, (2) Core Contributions, (3) The Key Method, and (4) Key Results & Implications. This prompt ensures the output is dense with expert-level insights by precluding generic, conversational language. The output, Ddra f t T , serves as the definitive textual foundation for subsequent generation agents. 4.2.2. Visual Analysis Agent Operating in parallel, the Visual Analysis Agent is prompted as a multimodal expert responsible for interpreting visual elements extracted in Stage 1. For each paired visual unit (vi, ci) \u2208Vpaired, it uses a Multimodal LLM (Mvision) to produce a comprehensive analysis (Ai), formalized as: Vanaly = { (\ufe00 vi, ci, Mvision(Ai|\u03c0 f ig, vi, ci) )\ufe00| (vi, ci) \u2208Vpaired}, (7) where \u03c0 f ig prompts the agent to act as an expert academic analyst. The model receives the figure image (vi) in high resolution and the relevant description (ci) in low resolution, integrating both to explain the figure\u2019s content, main message, and its contribution to the paper\u2019s argument. 4.2.3. Textual Enriching Agent This agent adapts the structured logical draft (Ddra f t T ) into a purely textual social media post tailored for a specific platform. Guided by a platform-specific prompt \u03c0text(pid), where pid is the platform identifier (e.g., \"twitter\"). The agent\u2019s function is: \u02c6Tenrich = Mtext(Tenrich|\u03c0text(pid), Ddra f t T , Dsum T ), (8) These prompts are highly engineered to transform the analytical content of Ddra f t T into the target platform\u2019s native style, incorporating elements like hooks, calls-to-action, and appropriate hashtagging. 7 Model Name Fidelity Engagement Alignment Avg.

Boldface indicates the best result. \u201cAvg.\u201d reports the average score across all metrics. 4.2.4. Visual-Text-Interleaved Combination Agent This agent creates posts that seamlessly integrate text and images through a two-step process. First, an LLM (Mcomb) determines optimal visual engagement based on platform-specific prompt \u03c0rich(pid): \u02c6P = Mcomb(P|\u03c0rich(pid), \u02c6Tenrich, \u02c6Ddra f t T , Vanaly), (9) The prompt directs the LLM to rewrite the draft into a compelling story, inserting placeholders where the corresponding figure vi has the greatest attractiveness impact. 4.3. Stage 3: Platform-Specific Adaptation The final stage is managed by an Orchestration Agent, which refines the integrated draft \u02c6P for publication. (1) Platform Adaptation: The agent applies a platform-specific prompt to rewrite \u02c6P as \u02c6Ppid, aligning the content with the target platform\u2019s stylistic norms, including tone, formatting, emojis, and hashtags. This process accommodates both rich text (with images) and text-only formats, defaulting to the latter if no visual elements were extracted in Stage", "Adaptation: The agent applies a platform-specific prompt to rewrite \u02c6P as \u02c6Ppid, aligning the content with the target platform\u2019s stylistic norms, including tone, formatting, emojis, and hashtags. This process accommodates both rich text (with images) and text-only formats, defaulting to the latter if no visual elements were extracted in Stage 1. (2) Packaging and Output: For rich text posts, the agent replaces placeholders with Markdown image tags and bundles the final Markdown file alongside all referenced image assets, producing a publication-ready resource. 5.

Current LLMs are still struggling on PRBench. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of current LLMs in generating high-quality academic promotional content, we benchmarked a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, including both open-source and closed-source variants (implementation details see in Appendix F and Table 8). As shown in Table 1, current LLMs, even the SOTA model, GPT-5, still struggle on PRBench, with average scores ranging from 31.05 to 70.56 across all models. More importantly, general improvement strategies offer limited help (Appendix G). Fidelity Bottlenecks. Factual fidelity is a central challenge across all evaluated models, as shown by the moderate-to-low Factual Scores in Table 1. Even Qwen-2.5-VL-32B-Ins, one of the stronger models, scores only 59.87, missing over 40% of key facts. Figure 4 (a) highlights a common error: omission of the paper\u2019s core idea (e.g., \u201cMixed-Policy GRPO\u201d), which obscures its novelty.

For each model, we compare the performance of our PRAgent against the Direct Prompt baseline.For a complete list of results for all models on PRBench-Core, please see Table 5 in the Appendix. 92% of errors fall into Numerical/Method/Terminology categories, where essential details are omitted or misstated. Thus, while models grasp general topics, they consistently fail to preserve the precise scientific promotion content, creating a fidelity bottleneck. No-Genuine Engagement. Although models can mimic engagement elements, our analysis reveals a consistent gap between formulaic output and genuine, human-like interaction. In Figure 4 (b), the AI- generated post reduces to an announcement, whereas the human-authored post develops a narrative with a strong hook (\u201cRepresentation matters.\u201d), a familiar challenge (\u201cPeople in academia always tell me...\u201d), and a sense of discovery. Analysis of hook strategies shows that 42% of posts lack any engagement device. These results indicate that current models often miss basic heuristics and fail to reproduce the authentic voice and narrative depth needed for meaningful connection. Superficial Platform Alignment. Table 1 shows that current LLMs achieve only moderate alignment scores (e.g., the Hashtag metric), reflecting shallow understanding. Figure 4 (c) further illustrates their reliance on generic, high-frequency tags rather than platform-specific styles. The average Jaccard similarity between generated and human hashtags was only 0.03, demonstrating failure to capture niche keywords critical for targeted discovery. Thus, current LLMs mimic surface conventions but neglect the strategic functions needed to engage expert audiences. 5.3. PRAgent can improve automatic promotion quality. PRAgent markedly surpasses direct prompting baselines. Given the suboptimal performance of direct prompting identified in earlier sections, we proceed to assess the effectiveness of PRAgent. As shown in Table 2, the results indicate that PRAgent consistently exceeds the direct prompting baseline by at least 7.15% across nearly all models and metrics. Notably, on GPT-5-mini, improvements surpass 20%, highlighting the 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Average View Duration Likes Views 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Saves/Bookmarks 0 500 1000 1500 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Baseline PRAgent Views 1178 5059 (+329%) Total Watch Time 12555 88375 (+604%) Profile Visitors 28 189 (+575%) Likes 42 226 (+438%) Saves/Bookmarks 78 308 (+294%) Followers Gained 4 27 (+575%) Shares 39 190 (+387%)", "Saves/Bookmarks 0 500 1000 1500 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Baseline PRAgent Views 1178 5059 (+329%) Total Watch Time 12555 88375 (+604%) Profile Visitors 28 189 (+575%) Likes 42 226 (+438%) Saves/Bookmarks 78 308 (+294%) Followers Gained 4 27 (+575%) Shares 39 190 (+387%) PRAgent Baseline PRAgent Baseline PRAgent Baseline PRAgent Baseline Paper Index Paper Index Paper Index Paper Index Figure 5: PRAgent significantly outperforms a direct-prompt baseline in a 10-day real-world study on the social media platform RedNote, with both methods using GPT-5 as the backbone model. substantial advantage of PRAgent\u2019s structured, multi-agent framework. This approach effectively decomposes the complex task into sequential stages of content extraction, synthesis, and platform-specific adaptation, which collectively contribute to its superior performance, even surpassing human authors in preference studies (See analysis in Appendix H). Moreover, all stages in PRAgent are essential, as demonstrated by ablation studies (See analysis in Appendix I). PRAgent performs well on real-world social media. To validate PRAgent in a real-world setting, we ran a 10-day in-the-wild study on RedNote (see Appendix J for detailed settings). We selected 10 recent NLP and CV papers from arXiv (Aug. 2025) as promotional targets. Two new accounts were created: one posting PRAgent-generated content (experimental) and one using a direct-prompt baseline (control). Both accounts simultaneously posted one paper promotion per day. As shown in Figure 5 (left), PRAgent posts consistently achieved substantially higher combined engagement (likes, saves, and shares) per article than the baseline, with the largest margin for Paper 10. Furthermore, the daily engagement trend in Figure 5 (right) shows that the PRAgent account received far more total interactions. Specifically, relative to the baseline, interaction metrics improved by at least 294%. For the most extreme metrics, total watch time increased by 604% and profile visitors by 575%. For a qualitative comparison of generated content, please see the examples showcased in Appendix K. 6. Related work Artificial intelligence is reshaping science, giving rise to AI for Research (AI4Research) [12, 62]. Existing systems support literature discovery, hypothesis generation, and scientific writing [61]. With Large Language Models (LLMs), the emphasis has shifted toward generative tasks [35]. More recently, multi-agent systems coordinate specialized AI agents to emulate research teams [22, 53]. Yet, while visions of autonomous research pipelines exist, the promotion stage is often only nominally considered and rarely implemented [37]. Social media has become integral to scientific dissemination [49], driving the rise of altmetrics as complements to citations [8]. Despite positive correlations, translating online attention into scholarly impact remains uncertain [45]. Effective engagement often requires strong narratives [41]. Early automation efforts include poster generation [48, 58] and science journalism [30], but challenges persist: LLM-generated summaries, though rated fluent, sometimes reduce reader comprehension [26]. While AI4Research addresses many stages of science, Research Promotion and Dissemination remains 11 underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the AutoPR task, alongside PRBench for standardized evaluation and PRAgent for practical deployment, bridging the divide between publication and public engagement [41]. 7. Conclusion We introduced automatic academic promotion (AutoPR) as a new, tractable research task for automated scholarly", "and Dissemination remains 11 underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the AutoPR task, alongside PRBench for standardized evaluation and PRAgent for practical deployment, bridging the divide between publication and public engagement [41]. 7. Conclusion We introduced automatic academic promotion (AutoPR) as a new, tractable research task for automated scholarly promotion, released PRBench to enable rigorous measurement across Fidelity, Engagement, and Alignment, and proposed PRAgent, a modular agentic framework that automates content extraction, multi- agent synthesis, and platform-specific adaptation. Across PRBench and downstream social metrics, PRAgent substantially outperforms strong LLM and rule-based baselines, yielding up to a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% increase in likes, and at least a 2.9x rise in engagement. Ablations highlight the importance of platform modeling and targeted promotion, underscoring that effective academic PR requires more than generic summarization.

Citation Trend Analysis Details To analyze citation trends in papers influenced by promotion, we followed the methodology of Betz et al. [7, 6], Venkatesh and BK [50], randomly selecting 20 AI researchers across various fields and collecting their papers published between 2023 and 2025. Citation counts were recorded to assess changes in academic impact. To ensure data diversity and quality, the sample comprised journal articles, conference papers with comparable openreview scores, and preprints rated similarly by humans. In addition to citation data, we investigated each paper\u2019s initial public release date through internet searches, focusing on sources like arXiv. If no preprint was found, the official publication date was used. We defined promotion based on whether the paper received significant academic attention, such as media coverage or widespread discussion, within one month of its release. To maintain data reliability, we applied rigorous statistical analysis. We required at least 200 papers in each category (promoted and non-promoted) to avoid biases from small sample sizes. Despite efforts to minimize bias through random sampling and broad field coverage, selection bias could still occur, as researchers in some fields may receive more promotional resources than others. To address this, following King et al. [33] and Aiza et al. [2], we ensured representation across diverse academic fields, institutions, gender, and career stages. This helped increase data diversity and applicability. Moreover, we ensured an even distribution of promoted and non-promoted papers across fields, pairing papers from the same researcher within similar fields to maintain quality. B. Human Annotation Protocol To construct a reliable gold-standard for our benchmark, we implemented", "gender, and career stages. This helped increase data diversity and applicability. Moreover, we ensured an even distribution of promoted and non-promoted papers across fields, pairing papers from the same researcher within similar fields to maintain quality. B. Human Annotation Protocol To construct a reliable gold-standard for our benchmark, we implemented a meticulous human annotation protocol. This protocol was designed to ensure high-quality, consistent data. B.1. Annotation Procedure and Quality Control Our annotation process was structured to ensure the reliability and validity of the collected scores, following the quality assurance pipeline in similar data-centric works. Annotation Rubric To align human evaluation with the LLM judge\u2019s criteria, human annotators were provided with a detailed scoring rubric identical to the prompt used for the automated judge. This guide specified the criteria for each metric, with annotators assigning a score on a 0-to-5 scale. Annotator Allocation To mitigate subjective bias, each post was independently assessed by a panel of at least three annotators. This multi-annotator setup is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the final scores. Consensus and Quality Assurance We implemented a two-tier protocol to reconcile scores and ensure high inter-annotator agreement. For each item, if the discrepancy between the maximum and minimum score was 2 points or less, the arithmetic mean of the three scores was taken as the final value. If the discrepancy exceeded 2 points, the item was flagged for a deliberative reconciliation session. In this session, the involved annotators discussed their rationales to reach a consensus, after which a final score was determined. 17 B.2. Ethical Considerations Our annotation process was conducted in adherence to strict ethical guidelines to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of all participants. The research articles used in this study were sourced from public, open-access repositories such as arXiv, aligning with our commitment to ethical data use by utilizing materials that are freely available for academic research. We recruited annotators from university graduate programs, and all participants were required to have a strong background in the relevant scientific fields to ensure a high level of comprehension for the annotation task. Prior to their engagement, all annotators provided informed consent and were fully aware of the research objectives and their role in the project. Furthermore, all participants were compensated for their work at an hourly rate that is in excess of the local minimum wage, a rate designed to fairly reflect the expertise and cognitive effort required. To protect the privacy of the participants, all data related to the annotators was anonymized and stored securely. C. Evaluation Prompts for PRBench This section contains the detailed prompts provided to the LLM judge for the automated evaluation of promotional posts within the PRBench benchmark. Each prompt is designed to assess a specific metric of post quality, ensuring a structured and consistent evaluation process. Evaluation Prompt: Authorship and Title Accuracy Role: You are an expert evaluator of social media communications for academic research. Your task is to assess an academic promotional post from social media based on \"Author and Title Presentation.\" Task: Your evaluation must follow a structured, step-by-step process:", "and consistent evaluation process. Evaluation Prompt: Authorship and Title Accuracy Role: You are an expert evaluator of social media communications for academic research. Your task is to assess an academic promotional post from social media based on \"Author and Title Presentation.\" Task: Your evaluation must follow a structured, step-by-step process: 1. Independently score two criteria: 1. Author Attribution Clarity and 2. Title Presentation Effectiveness, using the detailed 1-5 scale rubrics below. 2. Calculate a Final Score by taking the average of the two individual scores. 3. Provide a Detailed Justification, explaining the reasoning for each score with specific evidence from the provided post. Criterion 1: Author Attribution Clarity \u2022 5 (Excellent): Attribution is immediate, direct, and complete. This can be achieved in one of two ways: \u2013 A) Direct Mention: The author\u2019s full name and/or social media handle is explicitly mentioned, with a direct link to the publication or author\u2019s profile. \u2013 B) Clear Team Attribution: The post uses collective phrasing (e.g., \"We are excited to share...\", \"Our new paper...\") and clearly tags the social media handles of the primary author(s) and key contributors prominently within the main text. A link to the publication is also included. \u2022 4 (Good): Attribution is clear but requires a minor step. For example, the post uses collective phrasing (\"we\") and tags authors, but a direct link to the paper is missing. Or, the post says \"Our new paper is out\" and provides a link, but specific author names/tags are not in the post itself, requiring a click-through to identify them. \u2022 3 (Adequate): The author is mentioned, but attribution is not prominent. This includes posts that use \"we\" and mention author names as plain text (without tagging/linking their accounts), or place names/tags in a less visible area. \u2022 2 (Weak): Attribution is vague or indirect. The post uses collective phrasing like \"we\" or \"researchers from our lab\" without providing any specific names, tags, or a direct link to the publication, making it difficult to identify authors without significant effort. \u2022 1 (Poor): Author attribution is completely missing, incorrect, or so ambiguous that it\u2019s impossible to identify the author. Criterion 2: Title Presentation Effectiveness \u2022 5 (Excellent): The post accurately summarizes the core topic or main finding of the research in engaging, accessible language suitable for a general audience (e.g., poses a question, uses a key statistic, or states a clear takeaway). It avoids jargon while maintaining scientific accuracy. \u2022 4 (Good): The post accurately presents the topic, but the language could be more engaging or is slightly too technical for a general audience. It\u2019s a faithful but not particularly compelling summary. \u2022 3 (Adequate): The post uses the exact, formal academic title of the paper as the primary description without any attempt to rephrase it for a social media context. The title is accurate but dry. 18 Evaluation Prompt: Authorship and Title Accuracy (Continued) \u2022 2 (Weak): The post alludes to the topic but does so in a way that is unclear, overly simplistic, or slightly misrepresents the focus of the research. \u2022 1 (Poor):", "for a social media context. The title is accurate but dry. 18 Evaluation Prompt: Authorship and Title Accuracy (Continued) \u2022 2 (Weak): The post alludes to the topic but does so in a way that is unclear, overly simplistic, or slightly misrepresents the focus of the research. \u2022 1 (Poor): The title is completely missing, inaccurate, or presented in a misleading/clickbait manner that significantly misrepresents the research. Figure 6: The evaluation prompt used by the LLM judge to score the Authorship and Title Accuracy metric. It provides a detailed, multi-criterion rubric to ensure a consistent and fine-grained assessment of how well a post attributes authorship and presents the research topic. Evaluation Prompt: Logical Attractiveness Role: You are a Content Strategist specializing in science communication. Your task is to review a social media post about an academic study and evaluate its \u2019Logical Attractiveness\u2019 specifically for a non-expert audience. Task: Your evaluation should consist of two parts: 1. An Overall Assessment that explains your reasoning. 2. A Score on a continuous scale from 0 to 5. First, analyze the post by identifying the following key components of a logical narrative structure: \u2022 Hook: Does the post start with an engaging question, a surprising fact, or a relatable problem to capture attention? \u2022 Context: Does it provide the necessary background or establish the \u2019problem\u2019 in a way that a non-expert can understand its importance? \u2022 Core Finding: Is the main result or key message of the academic study clearly and simply stated? \u2022 Significance/Impact: Does it explain the \u2019so what?\u2019\u2014the potential impact, application, or importance of the findings? \u2022 Cohesion: Are there smooth transitions connecting these components into a coherent story? Then, use the detailed rubric below to assign your score. You are encouraged to use intermediate scores (e.g., 2.5, 4.5) for a precise assessment. \u2022 5 (Excellent): \u2013 Structure: All key components (Hook, Context, Core Finding, Significance) are present and arranged in a highly logical and persuasive order. \u2022 \u2013 Clarity: The narrative is self-contained. A non-expert can effortlessly follow the story from the initial hook to the final impact without needing prior knowledge. \u2013 Cohesion: Transitions between different parts of the post are seamless, creating a single, compelling narrative. \u2022 4 (Good): \u2013 Structure: All key components are present, but the ordering could be slightly optimized for better impact. \u2013 Clarity: The information is clear, but a non-expert might need to pause momentarily to connect the ideas. \u2013 Cohesion: Transitions are effective but may feel slightly functional rather than seamless. \u2022 3 (Adequate): \u2013 Structure: One key component is missing (e.g., no clear context or significance) or the components are arranged in a way that requires re-reading. \u2013 Clarity: The core message is understandable, but the surrounding information is somewhat disjointed, making the overall story harder to piece together. \u2013 Cohesion: Lacks clear transitions, forcing the reader to infer the connections between statements. \u2022 2 (Lacking): \u2013 Structure: Multiple key components are missing, or the information is presented as a list of facts rather than a narrative. \u2013 Clarity: The purpose or main", "overall story harder to piece together. \u2013 Cohesion: Lacks clear transitions, forcing the reader to infer the connections between statements. \u2022 2 (Lacking): \u2013 Structure: Multiple key components are missing, or the information is presented as a list of facts rather than a narrative. \u2013 Clarity: The purpose or main finding of the research is unclear to a non-expert. Key terms might be undefined. \u2013 Cohesion: The flow is abrupt and fragmented. \u2022 1 (Poor): \u2013 Structure: The post lacks a discernible logical structure. Information appears randomly placed. \u2013 Clarity: The content is confusing, jargon-heavy, or internally contradictory, making it nearly impossible for a non-expert to understand. \u2013 Cohesion: There is no logical connection between sentences or ideas. Figure 7: The evaluation prompt for Logical Attractiveness metric. It assesses the narrative structure and cohesion of a post, focusing on how effectively it communicates the research story to a non-expert audience. 19 Evaluation Prompt: Contextual Relevance Role: You are an expert social media analyst. Your task is to review the following academic promotion post and evaluate its \u2019Contextual Relevance\u2019 for the specified platform: {platform_source}. Note that this platform will be either X (formerly Twitter) or RedNote. Task: Your review must include two parts: 1. Detailed Assessment: Provide a structured analysis of the post, adapting your evaluation to the norms of the specified {platform_source}. Specifically comment on: \u2022 Tone & Framing: How is the content framed? Is the tone appropriate for the platform (e.g., X\u2019s conversational style vs. RedNote\u2019s personal, storytelling style)? For RedNote, pay special attention to the title\u2019s effectiveness as a \"hook.\" \u2022 Format & Visuals: How well are the format and visuals optimized for the platform? (e.g., For X: conciseness, use of threads, and a single strong visual. For RedNote: high-quality cover image, aesthetic carousels, and scannable text with emojis). \u2022 Content & Value: How is the academic content presented? Is it distilled into a valuable, easy-to-digest insight for a general audience? Is jargon explained? \u2022 Engagement Strategy: Does it use platform-specific features to drive interaction? (e.g., For X: strategic hashtags, mentions, polls. For RedNote: topic tags (#) and encouraging \"Saves,\" \"Likes,\" and comments). 2. Overall Score: Based on your assessment, provide a score on a continuous scale from 0 to 5. Use the detailed rubric below, paying close attention to the examples specific to {platform_source}. You are encouraged to use intermediate scores (e.g., 2.5, 4.5). Justify your score by referencing your analysis. \u2022 5 (Excellent - Native to the Platform): The post feels perfectly designed for the platform. \u2013 On X: It is concise, conversational, and features a strong visual hook. It uses strategic hashtags/mentions and has a clear call-to-action, potentially using a thread for depth. \u2013 On RedNote: It has a magnetic title and a high-quality, aesthetic cover image. The tone is personal and story-driven. The content is presented as valuable useful stuffwith great formatting, encouraging saves and comments. \u2022 3 (Adequate - Adapted but not Native): The post shows adaptation but doesn\u2019t fully embrace the platform\u2019s culture. \u2013 On X: It might be too formal or slightly too", "The tone is personal and story-driven. The content is presented as valuable useful stuffwith great formatting, encouraging saves and comments. \u2022 3 (Adequate - Adapted but not Native): The post shows adaptation but doesn\u2019t fully embrace the platform\u2019s culture. \u2013 On X: It might be too formal or slightly too long (without using a thread). The visual may be generic or missing, and the engagement strategy is weak. It feels like a shrunken-down press release. \u2013 On RedNote: The title and cover image are functional but not compelling. The tone is more informational than personal. It looks like content designed for another platform and cross-posted. \u2022 1 (Poor - Disregards the Platform): The post is a clear copy-paste from a formal document and ignores all platform norms. \u2013 This applies to both platforms. The post is a dense block of unformatted, academic text. It lacks any relevant visuals, has no title hook (for RedNote), and uses no engagement features (hashtags, mentions, CTAs). Figure 8: The evaluation prompt used by the LLM judge to score the Contextual Relevance metric. This prompt is adaptive, instructing the judge to evaluate a post based on the specific cultural norms, formatting conventions, and engagement strategies of the target platform (either X or RedNote). Evaluation Prompt: Visual Attractiveness Role: As an expert social media content reviewer, analyze the provided academic promotion, focusing on \u2019Visual Attractiveness\u2019. Task: If the post contains multiple images (e.g., a carousel or gallery), please evaluate them as a single, cohesive unit. Your overall assessment and final score should reflect the combined quality and effectiveness of the entire set of images. Use the detailed rubric below as a guide. The rubric values the effectiveness of the visual package in the social media context above all else. Provide a score on a continuous scale from 0 to 5. Scoring Rubric (Handles Multiple Images) \u2022 5 (Excellent): The visual package is exceptionally effective. If a single image, it\u2019s perfectly clear and compelling. If multiple images, all are of high quality and work together cohesively to tell a story or break down a concept. The set feels unified and purposeful. This can be a mix of custom graphics or exceptionally clear figures from the paper. \u2022 4 (Good): A strong, professional visual choice. If a single image, it\u2019s a clean, effective illustration. If multiple images, the set is consistently good and directly supports the text. There might be a minor inconsistency, but the overall package is effective. This is the typical score for a post that makes good use of several clear paper figures. 20 Evaluation Prompt: Visual Attractiveness (Continued) \u2022 3 (Adequate): The visual(s) are relevant but lack impact. If a single image, it\u2019s acceptable but uninspired. If multiple images, the set is a \"mixed bag,\" containing some good images but also others that are generic, overly complex, or less relevant. The overall impression is inconsistent. \u2022 2 (Subpar): The visual package has noticeable flaws. If a single image, it\u2019s weak. If multiple images, the set is dragged down by one or more poor-quality images (blurry, irrelevant,", "some good images but also others that are generic, overly complex, or less relevant. The overall impression is inconsistent. \u2022 2 (Subpar): The visual package has noticeable flaws. If a single image, it\u2019s weak. If multiple images, the set is dragged down by one or more poor-quality images (blurry, irrelevant, poorly cropped), even if other images in the set are acceptable. The overall presentation feels unprofessional. \u2022 1 (Poor): The visual(s) are of very low quality or irrelevant. If multiple images, most or all of them are flawed. This score also applies if images are absent when they are clearly needed. Figure 9: The evaluation prompt used by the LLM judge to score the Visual Attractiveness metric. This rubric is designed to holistically assess the quality, relevance, and narrative cohesion of all visual elements in a post, whether it\u2019s a single image or a multi-image carousel. Evaluation Prompt: Optimal Visual\u2013Text Integration As a visual communication expert, you are to evaluate an academic promotional post from a social media in {platform_source}. Your primary task is to assess its \u2019Optimal Visual\u2013Text Integration\u2019 by analyzing how effectively the visual elements and the text work together. Your evaluation should be holistic, beginning with foundational principles and building up to nuanced qualities. Provide an overall assessment and a score on a continuous scale from 1 to 5. Use the detailed rubric below as a guide. Foundational Principles of Visual Balance An effective social media post is built on a solid foundation. Before assessing finer details, consider these two fundamental principles of structure and layout: \u2022 Optimal Image Quantity: A well-balanced post typically utilizes 3 to 7 visuals. This range is the foundation for effective communication, providing sufficient detail without causing audience fatigue. Posts significantly outside this range often struggle to maintain a clear, compelling narrative. \u2022 Platform-Native Flow (Especially Twitter): The foundation of a strong narrative is the strategic interplay of text and visuals. On platforms like Twitter (X), stacking multiple images together in a single tweet disrupts this flow and fundamentally weakens the post\u2019s structure, forcing the user to context-switch instead of being guided through the information. Scoring Rubric: Visual-Text Integration \u2022 5 (Excellent Anchor): Synergistic, engaging, and built on a strong foundation. \u2013 Foundational Strength: The post is built on a strong foundation, employing an optimal number of visuals (3-7) and exemplary, platform-native placement that enhances the narrative flow. \u2013 Interdependence: The visual(s) and text are fully interdependent and synergistic. One is incomplete without the other, creating a message more powerful than the sum of its parts. \u2013 Clarity & Brevity: The post is immediately understandable. The core message is grasped within seconds. \u2022 3 (Adequate Anchor): Functional but foundationally flawed. \u2013 Foundational Weakness: The post exhibits a fundamental weakness in its structure. This is typically due to an inappropriate number of visuals (e.g., fewer than 3 or more than 7) or poor, non-native layout (e.g., image stacking on Twitter). While some information is conveyed, these foundational issues prevent it from being truly effective, limiting its overall quality to an adequate level. \u2013 Partial Redundancy:", "typically due to an inappropriate number of visuals (e.g., fewer than 3 or more than 7) or poor, non-native layout (e.g., image stacking on Twitter). While some information is conveyed, these foundational issues prevent it from being truly effective, limiting its overall quality to an adequate level. \u2013 Partial Redundancy: There may be some overlap between the visual and the text, or the visuals feel more like decoration than essential information. \u2013 Moderate Effort Required: The core message is present but requires more cognitive effort to parse. \u2022 1 (Poor Anchor): Ineffective and structurally unsound. \u2013 Lacks Foundation: The post lacks any structural foundation. It severely disregards the basic principles of quantity and placement, resulting in a chaotic, confusing, or barren presentation. \u2013 Severe Imbalance: The post is characterized by a \"wall of text\" with a non-existent or irrelevant visual, or vice-versa. \u2013 High Cognitive Load: The message is buried and difficult to understand due to the chaotic layout and lack of clear connection between text and visuals. Figure 10: The evaluation prompt for Optimal Visual\u2013Text Integration metric. This rubric assesses the synergy between a post\u2019s visual and textual components, focusing on interdependence and clarity optimization. 21 Evaluation Prompt: Engagement Hook Strength Role: You are a social media growth expert. Your task is to analyze the \u2019Engagement Hook Strength\u2019 of an academic promotion post for social media. The \"hook\" is the first one or two sentences designed to capture audience attention. Task: Provide an overall assessment and a score on a continuous scale from 0 to 5. Use the detailed rubric below as a guide for the anchor points (1, 3, and 5). You are encouraged to use intermediate scores (e.g., 2, 4, or even decimals like 3.5) to reflect the precise quality. Scoring Rubric \u2022 5 (Excellent Anchor): The hook is strategically designed for high engagement. \u2013 Criteria (must meet at least two): \u2217Sparks Curiosity: Asks a provocative question, presents a surprising fact/statistic, or makes a bold, counter-intuitive claim. (e.g., \"What if everything we know about X is wrong?\") \u2217Problem-Agitation: Directly addresses a known pain point or question relevant to the target audience. (e.g., \"Tired of struggling with data analysis? Our new study offers a solution.\") \u2217Direct & Personal: Uses direct address (\"You,\" \"Your\") to create an immediate connection with the reader. \u2217Clear Value Proposition: Immediately signals a clear benefit, solution, or fascinating insight for the reader. \u2022 3 (Adequate Anchor): The hook is clear and functional but lacks a strong engagement strategy. \u2013 Criteria: \u2217Informative Statement: Clearly and concisely states the topic of the research. (e.g., \"A new study explores the impact of climate change on coastal erosion.\") \u2217Conventional Phrasing: Uses standard, predictable language for academic announcements. (e.g., \"We are excited to announce the publication of...\") \u2217Passive Consumption: It informs the audience but does not actively invite interaction, curiosity, or emotional response. The value is implied rather than explicitly stated as a hook. \u2022 1 (Poor Anchor): The hook is ineffective and likely to be ignored. \u2013 Criteria (meets at least one): \u2217Overly Technical/Jargon-laden: Uses specialized terms not understandable to", "the audience but does not actively invite interaction, curiosity, or emotional response. The value is implied rather than explicitly stated as a hook. \u2022 1 (Poor Anchor): The hook is ineffective and likely to be ignored. \u2013 Criteria (meets at least one): \u2217Overly Technical/Jargon-laden: Uses specialized terms not understandable to a general audience, making it inaccessible. \u2217Vague or Abstract: Fails to clearly state the topic or its relevance, leaving the reader confused. (e.g., \"A new paper on methodological considerations is now available.\") \u2217No Hook Present: The post begins with dense details, publication citations, or a generic, uninteresting opening. \u2217Burying the Lead: The interesting or relevant part of the research is hidden behind introductory fluff or boilerplate language. Figure 11: The evaluation prompt for Engagement Hook Strength metric. This rubric focuses specifically on the opening sentences of a post, assessing their ability to capture attention and spark curiosity. Evaluation Prompt: Hashtag and Mention Strategy Role: You are a social media strategist specializing in academic communications. Your task is to evaluate the \u2019Hashtag and Mention Strategy\u2019 of the provided social media post, which aims to promote academic work. Task: Provide a concise overall assessment of the strategy\u2019s effectiveness and assign a score on a continuous scale from 1.0 to 5.0. Use the detailed rubric below. The anchor points (1, 3, 5) provide clear criteria. You are encouraged to use intermediate scores (e.g., 2.5, 4.0) to reflect the precise quality of the strategy based on these criteria. Detailed Scoring Rubric \u2022 Score 5.0 (Excellent / Strategic) \u2013 Award this score if the strategy meets almost all of the following criteria: \u2217Tiered Hashtag Approach: Utilizes a sophisticated mix of at least two, and ideally three, types of hashtags: \u00b7 Broad/Topical: Includes 1-2 high-traffic, general hashtags to maximize broad reach (e.g., #Science, #Research, #AI). \u00b7 Niche/Specific: Includes 2-4 specific hashtags that target a specialized audience, such as the academic sub-field, methodology, or specific conference (e.g., #QuantumComputing, #CRISPR, #MLA2025). \u00b7 Community/Branded: Includes relevant hashtags for the institution, lab, or campaign (e.g., #StateUResearch). \u00b7 Strategic Mentions: Effectively uses @mentions to tag relevant entities such as co-authors, the university/institution, the research lab, funders, and the publisher/journal. This is done to directly notify partners and encourage network amplification. \u00b7 Optimal Quantity: The total number of hashtags is appropriate for the platform and feels integrated, not spammy (generally 3-6 hashtags is a strong range). 22 Evaluation Prompt: Hashtag and Mention Strategy (Continued) \u2022 \u2013 \u2217Overall: The combination of hashtags and mentions creates clear pathways for discovery by both a broad audience and niche academic peers. \u2022 Score 3.0 (Adequate / Functional) \u2013 Award this score if the strategy is functional but lacks sophistication. \u2217Generic Hashtags: Primarily uses relevant but overly broad hashtags (e.g., uses only #Science, #Academic, #Paper). \u2217Missed Opportunities: Fails to include specific, niche hashtags that would effectively target the core academic audience. \u2217Limited Mentions: May mention the primary institution but omits key collaborators like co-authors, funders, or the specific journal. \u2217Suboptimal Quantity: May use too few hashtags (e.g., only one) or a slightly excessive amount of generic ones. \u2217Overall: The", "include specific, niche hashtags that would effectively target the core academic audience. \u2217Limited Mentions: May mention the primary institution but omits key collaborators like co-authors, funders, or the specific journal. \u2217Suboptimal Quantity: May use too few hashtags (e.g., only one) or a slightly excessive amount of generic ones. \u2217Overall: The strategy is better than nothing and will contribute to some discoverability, but it does not effectively target the most relevant communities. \u2022 Score 1.0 (Poor / Ineffective) \u2013 Award this score if the strategy demonstrates a clear lack of understanding. \u2217Irrelevant or No Hashtags: Uses hashtags that are completely unrelated to the academic content (e.g., #photooftheday), are broken (e.g., #My Research Paper), or are absent altogether. \u2217Spammy: Uses an excessive number of unrelated, high-volume hashtags in a clear attempt at \"hashtag stuffing.\" \u2217No Mentions: Makes no use of @mentions to tag any relevant people or organizations, isolating the post from its potential network. \u2217Overall: The strategy does nothing to enhance discoverability or engagement and may even detract from the post\u2019s credibility. Figure 12: The evaluation prompt used by the LLM judge to score the Hashtag and Mention Strategy metric. This rubric assesses the strategic use of hashtags and @mentions to maximize a post\u2019s discoverability among both broad and specialized audiences. Evaluation Prompt: Call-To-Action (CTA) Score Role: You are a Conversion Rate Optimization Specialist. Your task is to evaluate the post\u2019s Call to Action (CTA) based on a checklist of five criteria. Task: For each criterion below, determine if it is substantially met. Your final score will be the total number of criteria that are met, resulting in an integer score from 0 to 5. CTA Checklist 1. Action-Oriented Language: Does the CTA use strong, direct command verbs (e.g., \"Read,\" \"Download,\" \"Comment\")? 2. Benefit Highlighting: Does the CTA explain or imply what the user will gain by taking the action (e.g., \"...to learn our method\")? 3. Clarity & Conciseness: Is the CTA instruction unambiguous, simple, and easy to understand at a glance? 4. Strategic Placement: Is the CTA located in a prominent and logical position where a user is likely to see it and act (e.g., at the end of the post, in the bio link callout)? 5. Urgency/Scarcity: Does the CTA create any sense of immediacy or exclusivity (e.g., linking to a current trend, \"be the first to read\")? Count how many of these criteria are met and provide this number as the score. Figure 13: The evaluation prompt used by the LLM judge to score the Call-To-Action (CTA) Score metric. This checklist-based rubric provides a quantitative measure of the CTA\u2019s effectiveness by assessing its clarity, language, placement, and persuasive elements.

Academic Promotion Quality Assessment Owing to human quality annotation being costly and time-consuming, a critical component of our benchmark is the reliance on LLMs for large-scale evaluation. To validate this approach, we measured the correlation between the judgments of several prominent LLM judges and our human-annotated ground truth on PRBench. E.1. Evaluation Protocol We adopt the LLM as a Judge paradigm [60, 23, 9] for automated evaluation, using Qwen2.5-72B-VL. Our protocol comprises two complementary evaluation modes. Individual Post-level Evaluation assesses the absolute quality of a single promotional post based on a set of predefined criteria. To ensure stability, for each criterion requiring a scalar score (e.g., on a 0-to-5 scale), we query the LLM judge 3 times and use the arithmetic mean as the final score. Pairwise Comparative Evaluation assesses the relative quality between a candidate post PA and a post from a chosen reference set, Sk. This reference-based framework is designed to allow the benchmark\u2019s difficulty to evolve.

We report both Pearson (P) and Spearman (S) correlation coefficients across all Individual Post-level evaluation metrics. The analysis was performed on a dataset of 512 posts authored by humans.For the Factual Checklist Score, we randomly selected 135 sub questions for manual analysis.The metrics are categorized by their high-level evaluation objective. Maximum values in each metric are bolded. Except those results with \u201c\u2217\u201d, all results with p < 0.01. reference set (i.e., if Pref(Pagent, Sk) > T, it can become Sk+1), the evaluations conducted in this paper use the collection of human-authored posts as the primary reference set (S0). For a given pair (PA, PB) where PB \u2208S0, an evaluator provides a preference judgment. To implement this with an LLM judge and mitigate positional bias, each pair is presented twice in swapped order. A consistent choice results in a preference outcome, recorded as PA \u227bPB (A is better) or PB \u227bPA (B is better), while inconsistent choices result in a tie (PA \u223cPB). These outcomes are then aggregated to quantify performance, typically as a win rate against the references. E.2. Evaluation Experiment Analysis Current LLMs effectively assess the quality of promotional content. As shown in Table 3, it demonstrates a positive correlation (greater than 0.5) between LLM evaluations and human annotations across most individual PRBench metrics. These findings underscore the reliability of LLMs as evaluators, emphasizing both their strengths and limitations in this context. Moreover, this strong correlation suggests that LLMs can be valuable tools in providing consistent assessments, which are crucial for applications such as automated content moderation and performance analysis. Open-Source LLMs show greater alignment with human judgment. Open-source LLMs exhibit stronger alignment with human judgment across most metrics compared to closed-source models like GPT-4o and GPT-5-mini, as shown in Table 3. This suggests that open-source models more accurately capture the nuances of human evaluative criteria. In contrast, closed-source models tend to prioritize logical coherence and factual accuracy, as evidenced by their higher scores in Contextual Relevance, Logical Attractiveness, and Factual Checklist Score. However, they often overlook critical engagement factors, which are vital", "suggests that open-source models more accurately capture the nuances of human evaluative criteria. In contrast, closed-source models tend to prioritize logical coherence and factual accuracy, as evidenced by their higher scores in Contextual Relevance, Logical Attractiveness, and Factual Checklist Score. However, they often overlook critical engagement factors, which are vital in social media contexts, leading to suboptimal performance. LLMs excel at evaluating objective, text-based criteria but struggle with subjective, multi-modal judgments.

However, GPT-4o\u2019s low correlation score for Visual Attractiveness (less than 0.1) suggests that aesthetic evaluations remain challenging for LLMs. This highlights that subjective judgments, particularly in aesthetics, are still an evolving area for LLM-human alignment. Despite this, the high correlation in most metrics underscores the reliability of LLMs as scalable proxies for human evaluation in academic promotion. Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Ins exhibits the strongest and most consistent correlation with human judgments. Among the tested models, as shown in Table 3, Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Ins shows the highest and most consistent correlation with human judgments across most metrics. It achieves strong Pearson and Spearman correlations in criteria, confirming its selection as the primary judge in our evaluation protocol. For all evaluations, including absolute scores and pairwise preferences, Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Ins served as the primary and economical LLM judge framework, due to its strong alignment with human annotations. F. Direct Prompting Baseline Implementation To establish a clear performance benchmark, we implemented a baseline referred to as \"Direct Prompting.\" This method is designed to simulate a straightforward, non-agentic approach to the AutoPR task, reflecting how a user might naively employ a LLM for academic promotion. Specifically, given that a full research paper\u2019s text exceeds these limits, we employed a simple \u201cleft\u201d trun- cation strategy. The input for the LLM was constructed by extracting the initial 80K characters (approximately 20K tokens) from the paper\u2019s plain text, which typically includes the title, authors, abstract, introduction, and parts of the related work. This truncated text was then passed to the model with a direct and", "cation strategy. The input for the LLM was constructed by extracting the initial 80K characters (approximately 20K tokens) from the paper\u2019s plain text, which typically includes the title, authors, abstract, introduction, and parts of the related work. This truncated text was then passed to the model with a direct and simple instruction: \"Based on the following research paper content, generate a social media post to promote it.\" No further guidance on tone, structure, or platform-specific features (like hashtags) was provided. G. How do general strategies effect performance on PRBench? Long CoT Reasoning does not consistently improve AutoPR tasks. Long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) has recently emerged as a promising approach for tasks that require iterative reasoning [10, 13, 11]. To assess its effect, we evaluated the Qwen3 series under two settings: a \u201cthinking\u201d mode that enables Long CoT and a \u201cnon-thinking\u201d mode that uses standard inference. As shown in Figure 23 (a), enabling Long 31 Model Fidelity Engagement Alignment Overall Avg Qwen-2.5-VL-7B 42.42 47.91 51.53 47.29 + 1-shot 45.01 45.79 48.25 46.37 Qwen-2.5-VL-32B 56.39 73.31 69.18 68.88 + 1-shot 62.79 71.67 69.76 69.32 Qwen-2.5-VL-72B 63.94 73.46 72.89 71.69 + 1-shot 57.27 73.65 77.47 71.52 InternVL3-8B 48.30 62.08 69.01 61.40 + 1-shot 57.14 69.80 73.93 68.51 InternVL3-14B 49.07 61.93 70.31 61.87 + 1-shot 55.62 64.39 68.90 63.99 InternVL3-38B 46.20 59.21 67.15 58.99 + 1-shot 52.53 55.26 58.68 55.74 Table 4: Performance comparison between the standard Direct Prompt (zero-shot) and a stronger baseline incorporating one-shot example (+ 1-shot). CoT did not yield notable gains in average performance. Consistent improvement is observed only on the Engagement metric, and Long CoT even negatively affects other metrics for the Qwen3-235B model. These results indicate that Long CoT is not a universally effective strategy for improving performance on AutoPR tasks. Parameter scaling laws also hold in AutoPR scenarios. In general, increasing a model\u2019s parameters is a common way to improve performance. To examine this, we analyze four established LLM series. As shown in Figure 23 (b,c), we observe clear parameter-scaling effects across these models, which is well align with parameter scaling laws [32, 27]. While performance generally increases with model size, the trend is not strictly consistent across series. For example, Qwen3-32B can outperform the larger InternVL3-38B, indicating that, for this task, performance does not align uniformly with scale across model families. Inference-time scaling does not hold for AutoPR tasks. To investigate the impact of inference-time scaling, we analyze the relationship between think token count on Qwen3-30B-A3B and the average score on PRBench. Figure 23(d) shows that, contrary to conventional scaling laws, increased inference-time scaling does not yield monotonic performance gains in the AutoPR task. There is no positive trend; instead, we observe a negative correlation between think token count and average score (Pearson\u2019s r = \u22120.1616, p = 0.0003). We hypothesize that this arises from \u201cspecification drift,\u201d where excessive, unguided reasoning leads the model to over-interpret instructions, introduce extraneous details, or deviate from core objectives of Fidelity, Alignment, and Engagement. In-context Learning does not consistently improve performance. Our experiments show that In-context Learning (ICL), while always beneficial in", "0.0003). We hypothesize that this arises from \u201cspecification drift,\u201d where excessive, unguided reasoning leads the model to over-interpret instructions, introduce extraneous details, or deviate from core objectives of Fidelity, Alignment, and Engagement. In-context Learning does not consistently improve performance. Our experiments show that In-context Learning (ICL), while always beneficial in other generation tasks [17, 46, 47, 51], does not uniformly enhance performance across all metrics. This indicates that the effectiveness of prompting strategies is task- and model-dependent. As demonstrated in Table 4, the impact of ICL varies across models and metrics. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B shows a slight improvement in Fidelity, from 42.42% to 45.01%, but a decrease in Engagement (from 47.91% to 45.79%) and Alignment (from 51.53% to 48.25%). Similarly, Qwen-2.5-VL- 72B experiences a drop in Fidelity but an increase in Alignment. These mixed outcomes suggest that ICL 32 Model Name Fidelity Engagement Alignment Avg. A&T Acc.

This calls for further research to identify the conditions under which ICL is most effective. Overall, our findings highlight the nuanced effects of various strategies on AutoPR performance. While some approaches like parameter scaling show clear benefits, others such as Long CoT reasoning and one-shot prompting yield mixed results. This underscores the importance of tailored strategies that consider the specific demands of the AutoPR task and the characteristics of the models employed. H. Human Preference Analysis To further validate the performance of our proposed PRAgent, we conducted a human preference study on the PRBench-Core. In this study, human annotators were presented with pairs of promotional posts for the same research paper: one generated by PRAgent (using GPT-5 as backbone) and the other authored by a human. Annotators were asked to choose which post they preferred based on overall quality, engagement, and clarity, or to declare a tie if they were of comparable quality. The aggregated results are shown in Table 6, providing a direct measure of our method\u2019s performance against human-written content. 33 Preference Outcome Percentage (%) PRAgent-Generated Wins 64.8 Tie 23.4 Human-Authored Wins 11.7 Table 6: Percentage-based results of the hu- man preference study on PRBench-Core, com- paring human-authored posts against PRAgent- generated content (with GPT-5 as the backbone).

I. Each Stage Matters for PRAgent. To assess the contribution of each stage in PRAgent, we conducted ablations with the Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Ins model, systematically removing or altering core components of the multi-agent pipeline. As shown in Table 7, the results indicate that every specialized stage contributes distinctly to final output quality. (1) First, we bypassed Content Extraction and Structuring (Stage 1). Fidelity declined from 70.76 to 66.38, indicating that the hierarchical summarization helps preserve factual coherence. (2) Second, removing Multi-Agent Content Synthesis (Stage 2) impaired overall performance, with scores dropping across all three metrics, particularly in Alignment (76.29). (3) Lastly, we removed Platform-Specific Adaptation & Orchestration (Stage 3), which caused the most significant performance drop. This dramatically decreased the Alignment score from 79.38", "preserve factual coherence. (2) Second, removing Multi-Agent Content Synthesis (Stage 2) impaired overall performance, with scores dropping across all three metrics, particularly in Alignment (76.29). (3) Lastly, we removed Platform-Specific Adaptation & Orchestration (Stage 3), which caused the most significant performance drop. This dramatically decreased the Alignment score from 79.38 to 71.36 and Fidelity to 62.94, producing a generic-style post instead. In conclusion, these ablations provide strong evidence that each stage of PRAgent is indispensable. Further, to analyze the effectiveness of PRAgent\u2019s intelligent visual handling, we conducted a direct comparison with a Naive Visual Baseline across all six models evaluated on PRBench-Core. In this baseline, each post uniformly uses a screenshot of the corresponding paper\u2019s first page as its image. In contrast, PRAgent autonomously selects and prepares what it identifies as the most compelling visual elements from the paper. As shown in Table ??, PRAgent consistently outperforms the Naive Visual Baseline in both Visual Attractiveness and Visual-Textual Integration metrics across all models. This demonstrates that PRAgent\u2019s intelligent visual handling significantly enhances the overall quality and engagement of the generated promotional content. J. Real-World Study Setting Details To validate the practical efficacy of PRAgent, we conducted a 10-day in-the-wild study. The following provides a detailed account of the experimental settings designed to ensure the validity of the results and control for confounding variables. J.1. Setup Two new, anonymous accounts were created on the social media platform RedNote. To minimize any bias stemming from profile appearance while maintaining a professional look, both accounts were configured with similar styles: For username and profile picture, the accounts were given similar, tech-focused usernames typical of the platform and used stylistically similar avatars to project a consistent identity. For biography, the biography for both accounts was set to \u201cDaily NLP/CV Paper Sharing\u201d. This setup ensured that user engagement would be a response to the post content itself, rather than to any perceived identity or branding of the account. 34 J.2. Paper Selection Criteria. The study involved 10 recent research papers. These were randomly selected from arXiv preprints submitted in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) during August 2025. A key criterion was that these papers had not yet gained significant traction or been promoted by major academic influencers, thereby minimizing the impact of pre-existing public awareness on our engagement metrics. J.3. Posting Protocol. A strict posting protocol was enforced to ensure a controlled comparison: \u2022 Timing: Each day, promotional content for the same paper was published by both the PRAgent account (experimental group) and the Direct Prompt account (control group) at the exact same time: 12:00 PM (noon) Beijing Time. This time was chosen to ensure consistency across the experimental period. \u2022 Frequency: One paper was promoted per day for 10 consecutive days. J.4. Content Control The core variable was the method of content generation. To create a standardized condition for visual elements, the baseline posts uniformly used a screenshot of the corresponding paper\u2019s first page as their image. In contrast, PRAgent autonomously selected and prepared what it identified as the most compelling", "J.4. Content Control The core variable was the method of content generation. To create a standardized condition for visual elements, the baseline posts uniformly used a screenshot of the corresponding paper\u2019s first page as their image. In contrast, PRAgent autonomously selected and prepared what it identified as the most compelling visual elements from the paper. This allowed us to test PRAgent\u2019s entire content creation capability, including both text and visual selection. J.5. Interaction Policy. Throughout the 10-day experimental period, both accounts operated under a strict zero-interaction policy. They did not follow any other users, like or save any external posts, or reply to any comments received on their own posts. This ensured that all recorded engagement metrics (views, likes, saves, etc.) were purely organic and directly attributable to the appeal of the generated content. K. Showcase of Generated Examples To illustrate the qualitative differences between PRAgent and Direct Prompt, we present several representative examples in Figures 25 to 31. These examples highlight how PRAgent\u2019s structured multi-agent approach leads to more engaging, accurate, and platform-tailored promotional content compared to the baseline method. 35 \ud83d\ude80 First Systematic Study: dLLMs Can Be Efficiently Quantized Too!

However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need \u201cvicarious trial and error\u201d\u2014the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting\u2014in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (RESIM), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. RESIM thus grounds the agent\u2019s reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent\u2019s simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) RESIM effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning- intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent advances in language models have unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in domains such as mathematics and programming (Shao et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024). However, many emerging applications unfold in complex environments that require multi-step reasoning, such as web navigation (Zhou et al., 2024b; Deng et al., 2023), deep research (Gou et al., 2025a; Du et al., 2025), and computer/phone-use tasks (Xie et al., 2024; Rawles et al., 2025). Success in these domains depends not only on the ability to decompose goals and reflect on past progress, but also on AI agents\u2019 ability to construct accurate world models that capture the structure and dynamics of increasingly complex environments (Shao et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024). Insights from human cognition indicate why such ability to model and simulate complex environments is critical. Neuroscience research (Tolman, 1948; Daw et al., 2005; Daw & Dayan, 2014; Bennett, 2023) highlights the emergence of the neocortex as a turning point in intelligence, enabling early mammals to engage in \u201cvicarious trial and error\u201d: mentally simulating possible futures, evaluating their consequences, and selecting advantageous actions without directly experiencing each option. This ability greatly enhanced adaptability and decision-making, which we argue is equally essential for reasoning in long-horizon AI agent tasks. \u2217Work done during internship at Microsoft Research; \u2020Project Lead 1 arXiv:2510.09577v1 [cs.CL]", "and error\u201d: mentally simulating possible futures, evaluating their consequences, and selecting advantageous actions without directly experiencing each option.

Stage 1: ReSim Training Stage 2: Dyna-GRPO (b) Dyna-Mind Figure 1: We find the performance of strong reasoning models is heavily affected by its ability to simulate in different environments (left). We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework to integrate and improve simulation ability of AI agents (right). Empirical evidence supports this view. In Figure 1a, we observe that while strong reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 can simulate and solve structured environments like Sokoban, their performance drops sharply in more complex domains such as ALFWorld\u2014both in simulation accuracy and overall task success (also see Section 4.1.2). Initial attempts to address this limitation, such as Dyna- Think (Yu et al., 2025b), integrate simulation into reasoning through distilling simplified traces and adding auxiliary next-state prediction tasks. However, these methods rely on the strong capability of reasoning models to directly generate synthetic simulation data, which can embed errors and biases. To overcome this limitation, we present Dyna-Mind, an improved two-stage training framework to teach (V)LM agents to simulate the environment by directly learning from real experiences. In stage 1 training, we propose Reasoning with Simulations (RESIM) to algorithmically construct reasoning traces using expanded search trees obtained from real environment interactions, and train a policy model using these reasoning traces. In stage 2 training, we further improve the policy and its simulation ability using online reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce Dyna-GRPO, a novel algorithm that utilizes both outcome rewards and intermediate states from rollouts to improve the simulation ability of the policy. Extensive experiments on two widely used synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) show the effectiveness of each stage of the framework. Our results indicate that (1) RESIM\u2019s reasoning traces effectively teach AI agents to simulate; and (2) Dyna-GRPO, by leveraging both outcome rewards and intermediate interactions, learns better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. These findings highlight the importance of world simulation ability for reasoning in long-horizon tasks. 2 RELATED WORK (V)LM as decision making agents The use of (visual) language models as autonomous agents has been explored in a wide range of applications such as interactive game playing (Wang et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2025), computer, phone, and browser uses (Xie et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b; Rawles et al., 2025), software engineering (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), and more. Early works include reactive agents (Yao et al., 2023b) that directly prompts an (V)LM to", "al., 2023; Feng et al., 2025), computer, phone, and browser uses (Xie et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b; Rawles et al., 2025), software engineering (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), and more. Early works include reactive agents (Yao et al., 2023b) that directly prompts an (V)LM to make decisions on immediate observations without simulation or planning approaches, hindering performance on complex long-horizon tasks. Recent advances include: (1) search-based methods (Yao et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024a; Koh et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023; 2025a) that augments (V)LM agents with algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and MCTS; and (2) hierarchical, multi-agent methods (Zheng et al., 2024; Agashe et al., 2024; 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Gou et al., 2025b) that orchestrate multiple specialized agents to complete long-horizon tasks. While these methods show improvements, they often introduce substantial overheads during inference, such as requiring additional interactions with the environments or designing complex heuristics to orchestrate multiple agents. We focus on enhancing a single (V)LM agent by integrating simulation into its reasoning via training. Training (V)LM agents Early methods in training (V)LM agents mostly rely on supervised learning (SFT) with human annotations or data synthesized by state-of-the-art (reasoning) models (Zeng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025). Recently, many methods such as Feng et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025b); Wei et al. (2025a;b) leverage reinforcement learning 2 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 (RL) with verifiable rewards to directly train agents to complete tasks by prompting them to reason before taking actions, following the success of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a). However, it remains unclear whether extensive reasoning is necessary for all scenarios (Shojaee et al., 2025), and what aspects of such reasoning is essential for long-horizon tasks (Yu et al., 2025b). In this work, we specialize in integrating and improving the simulation ability of (V)LM agents during reasoning, and show that planning with world simulation is crucial for long-horizon tasks. World models and Dyna algorithms Beyond task completion, real-world interaction data contains rich information that can be used to help decision making. Early examples include Dyna algorithms (Sutton, 1991), which combine model-based and model-free methods to efficiently learn optimal policies. Given a set of real-world rollout data, Dyna (1) separately train a world model using these rollouts; (2) perform additional simulated rollouts with the world model; and (3) update the policy using both real and simulated rollouts. Applications of world model training have been explored in work such as Chae et al. (2025); Gu et al. (2025), facilitating search algorithms such as MCTS to improve performance; and applications of Dyna include Deep Dyna-Q (Peng et al., 2018), Switch-DDQ (Wu et al., 2018), and more (Zou et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2025b). However, these approaches either result in modular systems (a separate policy and world model) or require accessing state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our work does not rely on strong reasoning models, and focuses on integrating and improving simulation as part of an agent\u2019s reasoning process.", "2020; Yu et al., 2025b). However, these approaches either result in modular systems (a separate policy and world model) or require accessing state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our work does not rely on strong reasoning models, and focuses on integrating and improving simulation as part of an agent\u2019s reasoning process. 3 DYNA-MIND Research in human cognition (Daw et al., 2005; Daw & Dayan, 2014; Bennett, 2023) as well as in games like chess, go, and othello (Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Li et al., 2024; Nanda et al., 2023; Chae et al., 2025) suggests that strong agents implicitly store and use a (compressed) representation of the world to enhance their decision-making. This perspective highlights two key questions in existing approaches to improve (V)LM agents for long-horizon tasks: (1) how to synergize world simulations with reasoning; and (2) how to improve the simulation ability to help improve the policy. To address these questions, we introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework to teach (V)LM agents to plan with simulations during their reasoning and improve their task performance. We detail these two training stages next in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, respectively. 3.1 NOTATION Completing tasks in complex, realistic environments is typically formulated as a Markov Decision Process of (S, A, T , R). In the generic setting of multi-step tasks, an agent \u03c0\u03b8 receives an instruction and observation1 from the environment st \u223cS at time step t, generates an action at \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st), and transitions to the next state st+1 \u223cT (st, at). This process is repeated until the task is completed or until reaching a maximum number of steps, upon which a terminal reward rT \u223cR(sT , aT ) is provided based on whether the task is completed successfully or not. In the context of simple text games such as Sokoban Schrader (2018), a state st can represent the complete game state, and an action at is one of \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cup\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d (after some reasoning process). In more complex environments such as AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2025), a state st is the current screenshot of the android device, and an action at can be \u201ctapping on a coordinate (x,y)\u201d, \u201cswiping up\u201d, \u201cswiping down\u201d, etc. We note that since we aim to train agents to generate simulations within their reasoning process, any text that represents simulation is always part of the response at.2 Any variant of the symbol s represents real states from environment interactions, unless explicitly stated otherwise. 3.2 REASONING WITH SIMULATIONS (RESIM) To enable an agent to simulate during its reasoning, we first construct imitation learning data where the reasoning process consists of explicitly planning with simulations. Different from prior work 1Technically, any input to the agent from our environments is an observation (as in POMDP) instead of a state. However, to simplify notation we used s to generally denote the agent\u2019s input from the environment. 2As action plan/final action are always extracted from model response, we use a (by slight abuse of notation) to denote either the full response or the extracted executable action. Distinctions are made clear in context.

RESIM then trains an agent to directly generate such simulation-guided reasoning trace aReSim t without any algorithm support (right). such as Yu et al. (2025b) that leverages superior LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1 which already shows world modeling capability in its reasoning traces (see Section 4.1.1 for more details), we construct simulation-guided reasoning traces using search trees built from real environment interactions. RESIM Data Collection To construct reasoning data with rich simulations, we leverage algorithms such as depth first search (DFS) to construct search trees based on environment interactions, and then use an (V)LM to aggregate the entire search tree into a single reasoning response aReSim for later training. Specifically, given a state s, RESIM first uses a rollout model \u03c0\u03b8 to generate b rollouts from s up to depth d. This rollout model can be a specialized/finetuned LLM (see Section 4.1) or simply prompting a generic LLM (see Section 4.2). Then, RESIM uses a value function V\u03bd to provide an estimate of the quality of each of the partial rollouts, where the V\u03bd can be implemented as either a finetuned value model (see Section 4.1) or using LLM-as-a-judge (see Section 4.2). Finally, we use a generic (V)LM to aggregate all these rollouts and their values into a single response aReSim by prompting the (V)LM to 1) first independently summarize each partial rollout, which contains ground- truth future states information from the environment; and 2) then aggregate all these summaries into a coherent response conditioned on the current state s and previous h actions and states, and choose the best plan and the next immediate action for execution. The final chosen action from aReSim is then executed in the environment, and this process is repeated until the task is solved or until a maximum number of steps is reached. We illustrate this process in Figure 2 Left and Algorithm 3. We note that since RESIM essentially converts real search trees into a single", "aReSim is then executed in the environment, and this process is repeated until the task is solved or until a maximum number of steps is reached. We illustrate this process in Figure 2 Left and Algorithm 3. We note that since RESIM essentially converts real search trees into a single reasoning trace, it is not limited to (1) agent-environment interactions; (2) specific search algorithms used in this work. We believe other domains such as agent-user-environment interactions or other algorithms such as MCTS are also applicable, which we leave for future work. RESIM Distillation Since each response aReSim encapsulates an entire search tree in its reasoning, we directly use aReSim as the training target given an input s to teach the model to perform simulation- guided reasoning without any algorithm support. We illustrate this in Figure 2 Right. Specifically, given a collection of trajectories \u03c4 = {s0, aReSim 0 , s1, aReSim 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sT , aReSim T } produced by RESIM inference, we use SFT to train the model to directly generate each aReSim t given the current state st as well as a maximum history of h previous actions and states in the trajectory (i.e., the same input used by other inference methods such as REACT). 3.3 DYNA-GRPO While RESIM provides a principled way to synergize simulation with reasoning, it is computationally expensive and relies on multiple modules (a rollout model, a value function, and a (V)LM to aggregate the search tree into a single response) to construct training data. Additionally, such offline training may limit models\u2019 generalization ability to new tasks. To address this, we propose DYNA-GRPO, a modification of GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) to further improve the model\u2019s simulation ability during 4 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Group Comp.

However, RL algorithms such as GRPO aim to optimize a policy only using scalar rewards RT but do not provide any direct training signal on refining the reasoning process or world model simulations. We propose DYNA-GRPO to address this, by additionally incorporating future state(s) information st+1, st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as textual signals to help improve the model\u2019s response a \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st) during RL training. Since textual signals cannot be directly \u201coptimized\u201d, we propose SIMROLLOUT to instead prompt the underlying model to refine its simulation in a \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st) utilizing real future state(s) st+1, st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 during RL rollouts. Then, during optimization we train the policy to both directly generate the refined action and also to improve its \u201csimulation refinement\u201d ability (DYNA-GRPO).

We illustrate this rollout process in Fig- ure 4 and provide the pseudo-code in Algorithm 2. We note that this is different from methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), which performs reflection at the end of the episode utilizing suc- cess/failure information, and is also not intended for any training purposes. Empirically, we find the resulting arefine indeed improves the policy\u2019s simulation and performance (see Section D.3). 5 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Algorithm 1 DYNA-GRPO Require: policy \u03c0\u03b8, environment T , group size G Require: hyperparameters G, N, nT , n\u03c0 1: for N training iterations do 2: // simulation improvement 3: for nT steps do 4: // see Algorithm 2 5: {\u03c4 \u2032}, {\u03c4 \u2032 refine} \u2190SimRollout(\u03c0\u03b8, T , G/2) 6: {\u03c4} \u2190Rollout(\u03c0\u03b8, T , G/2) 7: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4} \u222a{\u03c4 \u2032}) 8: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4 \u2032 refine}) using Arefine 9: end for 10: // policy improvement 11: for n\u03c0 steps do 12: {\u03c4} \u2190Rollout(\u03c0\u03b8, T , G) 13: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4}) 14: end for 15: end for 16: return \u03c0\u03b8 DYNA-GRPO", "G/2) 7: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4} \u222a{\u03c4 \u2032}) 8: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4 \u2032 refine}) using Arefine 9: end for 10: // policy improvement 11: for n\u03c0 steps do 12: {\u03c4} \u2190Rollout(\u03c0\u03b8, T , G) 13: Update \u03c0\u03b8 with GRPO({\u03c4}) 14: end for 15: end for 16: return \u03c0\u03b8 DYNA-GRPO Training To utilize refined tra- jectories from SIMROLLOUT during RL, we fol- low Dyna algorithms to improve the model\u2019s policy and simulation ability iteratively. Specif- ically, DYNA-GRPO iterates between (1) sim- ulation improvement where models learn from refined policies that use future states information from SIMROLLOUT to improve its simulation ability; and (2) direct policy improvement where models are trained on standard rollouts without future-state access, allowing it to better integrate simulation ability into decision-making. We il- lustrate both training processes in Figure 3, and detail the overall algorithm in Algorithm 1. During simulation improvement, for each task we (1) first perform SIMROLLOUT with a group size of G/2, collecting refined trajectories with and without future-state information removed: \u03c4 \u2032 = {s0, arefine 0 , s1, arefine 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } and \u03c4 \u2032 refine = {srefine 0 , arefine 0 , srefine 1 , arefine 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }; (2) then perform standard rollouts with group size of G/2; (3) combine these standard rollouts \u03c4 with refined trajectories \u03c4 \u2032 into a single group of size G and perform GRPO on this combined group; (4) finally utilize \u03c4 \u2032 refine to also improve the model\u2019s simulation refinement ability, using the following modified advantage to reward refinements that both correctly solves the task and improves upon (the mean reward of) standard policy rollouts which does not access future states: Arefine(\u03c4 (i) refine) = ( 1.0, if \u03c4 (i) refine is correct and R(\u03c4 (i) refine) > max( \u00afR, \u00afRrefine) 0.0, otherwise , where \u00afR = 1 G/2 PG/2 i=1 R(\u03c4 (i)) is the mean reward of the standard policy rollouts (line 6 of Algo- rithm 1); \u00afRrefine = 1 G/2 PG/2 i=1 R(\u03c4 (i) refine) is mean reward from SIMROLLOUT (line 5 of Algorithm 1). During policy improvement, we perform standard policy rollouts without future state information, optimized by GRPO using episode-level advantage (Feng et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). 4 EXPERIMENTS We first evaluate Dyna-Mind on two \u201csynthetic\u201d environments (Sokoban and ALFWorld) that require efficient planning for successful task completion. These lightweight environments allow us to provide detailed analysis of the different reasoning styles as well as different RL algorithms. Then, we extend our methods to a more complex and realistic environment (AndroidWorld). 4.1 TEXT GAMES Benchmarks Sokoban (Schrader, 2018) is a grid-world game where the agent needs to push boxes to target destinations while avoiding obstacles, and successful task completion requires spatial planning to avoid deadlock situations. ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a text-based embodied environment where the agent needs to locate/interact with objects to complete household tasks using natural language instructions. To evaluate the agent\u2019s generalization ability, we construct training set, an in-distribution (ID) test set, and an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set. For", "deadlock situations. ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a text-based embodied environment where the agent needs to locate/interact with objects to complete household tasks using natural language instructions. To evaluate the agent\u2019s generalization ability, we construct training set, an in-distribution (ID) test set, and an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set. For Sokoban, we use training set with 6x6 room layouts with 1 box and 1 destination; ID test set with different 6x6 room layouts than training; and OOD test set with 8x8 room layouts with 1 box and 1 destination. For ALFWorld, we directly use the official training, ID, and OOD test splits from Shridhar et al. (2021). Baselines setup To evaluate RESIM, we compare against (1) ReACT based prompting methods with models such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Claude-3.7 (Anthropic, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025b), and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a); and (2) training methods that distill the reasoning traces from strong policy models such as DeepSeek-R1. To evaluate stage 2 DYNA-GRPO training, we compare against other popular group-based RL algorithms such as RLOO (Kool et al., 6 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 1: Performance on text game environments such as Sokoban and ALFWorld. \u201cGen.

Overall, we also compare against Dyna-Think (Yu et al., 2025b), which similarly uses two-stage training (DIT and DDT) to improve model\u2019s simulation ability. Dyna-Mind setup To instantiate RESIM, we use Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) as rollout and value function models, finetuned on rollouts obtained by using DeepSeek-V3 (see Section D.2 for more details) and use DeepSeek-V3 as the LLM to aggregate the search tree into a single response. For Sokoban, we use d = 5, b = 16, btrain = 2; for ALFWorld, we use d = 2, b = 24, btrain = 4. We note that all models used by RESIM are by themselves much weaker than other models such as DeepSeek-R1 as well as RESIM itself. Since DeepSeek-R1 and RESIM have a higher success rate than DeepSeek-V3, to isolate", "for ALFWorld, we use d = 2, b = 24, btrain = 4. We note that all models used by RESIM are by themselves much weaker than other models such as DeepSeek-R1 as well as RESIM itself. Since DeepSeek-R1 and RESIM have a higher success rate than DeepSeek-V3, to isolate improvement from better reasoning from simply training with more (diverse) data, we thus only used trajectories where all methods correctly solved the task for stage 1 training. This results in a total of 207 trajectories in Sokoban and 200 trajectories in ALFWorld from each method (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, and RESIM) in the subsequent stage 1 training. To instantiate DYNA-GRPO, we continue training the best model from stage 1 distillation. To ensure a fair comparison, we use identical hyperparameters for all methods (RLOO, GRPO, and DYNA-GRPO), when applicable. For DYNA-GRPO, we use nT = 10 and n\u03c0 = 10 for Sokoban and nT = 10 and n\u03c0 = 20 for ALFWorld. For more setup details, please see Section D.4. 4.1.1 MAIN RESULTS In the upper section of Table 1, we first evaluate RESIM\u2019s performance against other strong reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. Then, we compare different training methods to integrate/improve the simulation ability of the policy model. In Table 1, we first find that RESIM achieves near-perfect performance on Sokoban (96.4% success) and a strong performance on ALFWorld (87.7% success), significantly outperforming all other methods. On Sokoban, we find strong reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 also achieves near-perfect performance, which we attribute to R1\u2019s ability to correctly simulate Sokoban game states (but not on ALFWorld) during its reasoning process (see Section 4.1.2 for empirical results). In contrast, RESIM utilizes ground-truth simulations from search trees, and hence was able to achieve strong performance in both environments. In stage 1 training, we find DISTILL(RESIM) achieves a similar performance to DISTILL(R1) on Sokoban but significantly outperforms both DISTILL(V3) and DISTILL(R1) on ALFWorld. Addition- ally, since RESIM constructs reasoning traces consists almost entirely of only planning via simulation (see Figure 2 Left), DISTILL(RESIM) outputs 11x less tokens on average compared to DISTILL(R1). 7 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 2: Measuring simulation ability of different models across different training stages. We report the average success rate and the simulation ability (Sim Score \u2208[0, 1]) averaged across all trajectories.

In stage 2 training, we continue from the best model (DISTILL(RESIM)) with online RL. In Table 1, we find that DYNA-GRPO improves upon both GRPO, RLOO, as well as Dyna-Think, while maintaining a similar output token length compared to its base model DISTILL(RESIM). This indicates that DYNA-GRPO is effective at improving the model\u2019s simulation ability during online RL training (also see Section 4.1.2 for empirical results), and that improving such simulation ability helps improve task performance. 4.1.2 MEASURING SIMULATION ABILITY Dyna-Mind aims to integrate and improve the simulation ability of agents. To measure this simulation ability, we evaluate the Simulation Score (Sim Score) of different models and the Spearman Correlation Coefficient (rs) between sim score and success rate. Given a state st and generated response at \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st), we evaluate the simulation score of at by 1) first prompting an LLM to extract the final action plan (\u02c6a1, \u02c6a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u02c6ad) and the natural language description (i.e., simulation) of the corresponding imagined next-states (\u02c6st+1, \u02c6st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u02c6st+d) from the response at; 2) then execute the action plan in the environment to obtain ground truth next-states {st+1, st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st+d}; 3) finally, prompt an LLM to judge (Zheng et al., 2023) the correctness of these simulated next-states \u02c6si by comparing them against the ground truth si, returning a score \u2208[0, 1]. Finally, we averaged the score for each turn to obtain an overall simulation score for the trajectory. To ensure a fair judgment, we used a different LLM from all of our experiments (Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (Qwen Team, 2025)). For judgment prompts, please see Section D.5. We present the results in Table 2. In Table 2, we find that 1) RESIM maintains its strong success rates across both Sokoban and ALFWorld due to its perfect simulation ability (by construction), whereas DeepSeek-R1 struggled in ALFWorld as it struggles to model the environment layout; and 2) both DISTILL(RESIM) and DYNA-GRPO improve the simulation ability alongside task performance compared to their baselines. These results show that our methods helped improve the simulation ability of the model beyond simply improving task performance. 4.2 ANDROIDWORLD Next, we extend our Dyna-Mind to AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2025) - a highly challenging benchmark that evaluates the agent\u2019s ability control and complete tasks on a virtual Android device. Benchmarks AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2025) provides a fully functional Android environment that requires the agent to interact with Android\u2019s GUI to complete tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Since tasks in AndroidWorld are parameterized by task types (116), we construct a training set with 81 task types with in total 1946 tasks, an ID test set with 128 different tasks from the same 8 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR", "tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Since tasks in AndroidWorld are parameterized by task types (116), we construct a training set with 81 task types with in total 1946 tasks, an ID test set with 128 different tasks from the same 8 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 3: Performance on AndroidWorld. All training in stage-1 and stage-2 are based on Qwen2.5- VL-7B/32B-Instruct. We exclude Dyna-Think since (most) VLMs cannot predict images, as required by DDT( \u02c6T ) training. All results are averaged over 3 runs. Our methods are highlighted in gray. Method Gen.

We use a maximum number of 15 steps and the screenshot-only modality as input. We provide an example task and action in Section E.1. Baselines setup Since our methods consider end-to-end training, we compare against models that are capable of directly generating executable actions given an GUI screenshot, and exclude modular systems such as Gou et al. (2025b); Agashe et al. (2025). We thus mainly compare against (1) REACT based prompting method with Qwen2.5-VL-72B/7B (Bai et al., 2025), and GPT-4o; and (2) distillation from Qwen2.5-VL-72B3. To evaluate stage 2 DYNA-GRPO, we compare against GRPO following Section 4.1. We exclude comparison against Dyna-Think in this experiment, because DDT( \u02c6T ) trains the model to predict next-state (in this case, screenshot images), which cannot be implemented using most VLMs as they can only generate text. Dyna-Mind setup Since AndroidWorld is a highly challenging and compute-intensive environment (each episode on average takes 15-20 minutes to complete), we do not perform any rollout/value function training for RESIM. Instead, we directly prompt Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the rollout model, prompt GPT-4o as a judge to approximate the value function, and also use GPT-4o as the VLM to aggregate the rollouts into a single response in RESIM. We use d = 1, b = 16, btrain = 4 for RESIM, and a total of 128 trajectories for distillation/stage 1 training. To instantiate DYNA-GRPO, we generally followed the same recipe as Section 4.1, but used less training steps (60) as AndroidWorld is highly compute-intensive and time-consuming. For more details, please see Section E.2. 4.2.1 MAIN RESULTS Results We present the results in Table 3. In general, we observe similar results compared to Section 4.1.1. First, we find that RESIM inference significantly improves performance, and that the improved performance can be transferred to Qwen2.5-VL-7B and 32B via DISTILL(RESIM). Next, in both training stages of Dyna-Mind, we find improved performance in both ID and OOD test sets compared to baselines, including Qwen2.5-VL-72B and even RESIM. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method to improve agent\u2019s", "that the improved performance can be transferred to Qwen2.5-VL-7B and 32B via DISTILL(RESIM). Next, in both training stages of Dyna-Mind, we find improved performance in both ID and OOD test sets compared to baselines, including Qwen2.5-VL-72B and even RESIM. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method to improve agent\u2019s performance in complex environments. Error Analysis Compared to synthetic text games (Section 4.1.1) where RESIM achieves near- perfect performance, we find RESIM struggles in AndroidWorld despite improvements compared to baselines. After analyzing trajectories produced by RESIM, we find performance is bottlenecked by the rollout model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B), mainly due to: (1) incomplete understanding of some GUI interfaces and certain button functions, and (2) inability to recover after making multiple mistakes. 3We were unable to reproduce the reported performance of more recent GUI models such as UI-Tars1.5 (Qin et al., 2025), and hence focus on using Qwen2.5-VL for simplicity. Please see Section E.3 for more details. 9 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 We believe methods to improve the foundation model\u2019s capability could mitigate these problems (Wang et al., 2025a; Qin et al., 2025), which we leave for future work. 5 CONCLUSION In this work, we propose Dyna-Mind to synergize reasoning with simulations for autonomous AI agents. We empirically show that an agent\u2019s ability to model and simulate the environment strongly correlates with its ability to correctly reason and complete long-horizon, planing-intensive tasks. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training method to explicitly teach (V)LM agents to integrate and improve such simulation a part of their reasoning. In stage 1 training, we propose RESIM to train a model to simulate future states by learning to predict an expanded search tree in their reasoning. In stage 2 training, we propose DYNA-GRPO to further refine the agent\u2019s reasoning and simulation ability using online RL. Empirical results on three benchmarks show that (1) RESIM effectively teaches AI agents to simulate; and (2) DYNA-GRPO, by leveraging both outcome rewards and intermediate interactions, learns better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks.

We did not use LLMs to generate any research ideas, automate experiments, or analyze results. B ETHICS STATEMENT Generally, while most methods and models are not designed for unethical usage, there is often potential for abuse in their applications. Autonomous AI agents can be used for a variety of tasks such as automating information gathering, software development, computer/phone-use and more. In this work, we proposed our Dyna-Mind framework to enhance the simulation ability and hence performance of AI agents. However,", "there is often potential for abuse in their applications. Autonomous AI agents can be used for a variety of tasks such as automating information gathering, software development, computer/phone-use and more. In this work, we proposed our Dyna-Mind framework to enhance the simulation ability and hence performance of AI agents. However, since AI agents are fundamentally task-agnostic, it is possible to use them for unethical tasks such as scamming or disseminating false information on the internet. We believe developing guardrails such as safety filters (OpenAI, 2022; Inan et al., 2023) are highly valuable for AI agent research. We do not condone the Dyna-Mind or its constituent methods for any unlawful or morally unjust purposes. C ADDITIONAL ALGORITHMIC DETAILS In Algorithm 2, we provide the pseudo-code for SIMROLLOUT. On a high level, SIMROLLOUT aims to generate a refined response at a given state st with better simulation content compared to that of the original response. Specifically, SIMROLLOUT first performs normal inference at \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st) to generate a response; extracts the plan (\u02c6a1, \u02c6a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u02c6ad) from at using the \u201c<plan></plan>\u201d tags (see Table A3 for example response with such tags); executes the extracted plan in the environment and obtain the actual next-states {st+1, st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st+d}; and finally, prompts an LLM to refine the original response based on the actual next-states, using the prompt in Table A2. The resulting refined response arefine t is then used as the next action at, and this process is repeated until the task is completed or a maximum number of steps is reached.

Valid actions in ALFWorld are dependent on what\u2019s available in the current state. We provide an example input state and generated action in Table A4. D.2 RESIM IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We provide a pseudo-code for RESIM in Algorithm 3. For text games, we finetune Qwen2.5-32B- Instruct as rollout and value function models using DeepSeek-V3\u2019s rollouts. Specifically, we first use DeepSeek-V3 to generate 256 rollouts using tasks from the training set. Then, to train the rollout model, we simply perform SFT training on one correct rollout for each task. To train the value function, we use the trained policy model to generate the same 256 rollouts, repeated over 3 times, and compute V (st) as the probability of successfully completing the task from st across all trajectories that contains st, discounted by the number of remaining steps needed in the current trajectory: V (st) = \u03b3tmax\u2212t 1 |T| X \u03c4\u2208T 1[\u03c4 is successful], where T \u2261{\u03c41, \u03c42, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |st \u2208\u03c4i} where \u03b3 is the discount factor and tmax is the maximum number of steps in a trajectory. In both environments, we used \u03b3 = 0.95. Finally, we finetune a separate Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct as the value function by adding a linear value head to the model architecture, and perform MSE loss training on the computed V (st) across all states from all trajectories. Since Sokoban and ALFWorld environments are fast, these rollouts were completed within 1 hour. For complex environments such as AndroidWorld, we directly prompt pretrained VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and GPT-4o as rollout and value function models (Section 4.2). D.3 SIMULATION REFINEMENT PERFORMANCE To empirically show that (V)LMs are capable of leveraging next-state information to improve their action, we evaluate the performance of SIMROLLOUT compared to direct prompting (REACT). We report the result in Table A1. In general, we find that 1) all models showed improved task success rate when provided with next- state information; and 2) stronger models such as GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2024; 2025) shows larger improvement compared to weaker models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We believe this is because correcting its own mistakes is requires non-trivial reasoning ability, which is more difficult for weaker models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to achieve. Overall, this result indicates that world modeling error (e.g., especially for tasks such as ALFWorld) remains a significant bottleneck for (V)LM agents reasoning ability in long-horizon tasks.

D.5 SIMULATION SCORE PROMPTS To evaluate the simulation ability of a model \u03c0\u03b8, we use LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) to measure the correctness and quality of the simulation generated by \u03c0\u03b8 at each turn in a given tra- jectory. Specifically, for each at \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|st), we first prompt an LLM to extract the final action plan (\u02c6a1, \u02c6a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u02c6ad) from at and the corresponding natural language description of the next-states (\u02c6st+1, \u02c6st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u02c6st+d) from the response at. We present the prompts used for Sokoban and ALF- World in Tables A5 and A7, respectively. Then, we execute the action plan in the environment to obtain ground truth next-states {st+1, st+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st+d}. Finally, we prompt an LLM to judge the quality of the plan by comparing \u201cimagined\u201d next-states generated by \u03c0\u03b8 against the ground truth next-states, using prompts in Tables A6 and A8. This results in a score \u2208[0, 1] for each turn in the trajectory, which is then averaged across all turns to obtain an overall simulation score for the entire trajectory.

E.2 ADDITIONAL TRAINING DETAILS To standardize training and evaluation, we use the dockerized version of AndroidWorld and adapt the action space provided by Rawles et al. (2025). To instantiate DYNA-GRPO, we continue training the best model from stage 1 distillation. We followed Section 4.1 and used a batch size of 8 tasks per batch, group size of G = 8, learning rate of 1e-6. Since AndroidWorld is highly compute-intensive and time-consuming to run, we perform a total of 60 training steps for RL training, using nT = 2 and n\u03c0 = 8.

E.3 OTHER IMPLEMENTATION/EVALUATION DETAILS In this work, we focus on end-to-end training (SFT + RL), and hence selected VLMs capable of directly interacting with android\u2019s GUI interface. This include models such as Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) and UI-Tars (Qin et al., 2025). While these models have undergone specific finetuning on mobile control tasks, at the time of the work we were unable to find evaluation scripts that supports using these models on AndroidWorld. To our best effort, we utilized the official mobile-use prompts provided by the respective repositories, as well as prompts from recent work such as (Gou et al., 2025b). However, we were unable to fully reproduce the reported performance, especially for UI-Tars 1.5. At the time of this work, we find similar concerns has also been raised publicly (e.g., https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS/issues/83, https://github. com/UI-Tars/UI-Tars/issues/155, https://github.com/UI-Tars/UI-Tars/ issues/121). To this end, we focus on using Qwen2.5-VL for consistency with other experiments conducted in the rest of the paper. 18 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table A2: Prompt used by SIMROLLOUT to refine the agent\u2019s original response given actual next-state information. The next-state information is obtained by 1) extracting the final chosen plan from the agent\u2019s response (e.g., left, left, up in Sokoban), and 2) executing the plan in the environment to obtain the actual next states. Prompt // ...omitting some text # Current observation {current_observation} # Example response and feedback To help you reason and plan better, we have explored some plans for the current step and obtained the following feedback from the environment: ## Example response {agent_original_response} ## Ground truth feedback {actual_next_observations_after_executing_agent\u2019s_plan} # Back to the current step Now, the environment has been reset back to the current observation/current step. It\u2019s your turn to refine the example response based on the ground truth feedback. You should think about: - Correctness: is the example response aligned with the feedback? did the feedback reveal some incorrect/ineffective actions in the example response? - Progress: did the the environment feedback show positive progress towards solving the task? Note: the example response may hallucinate incorrect outcomes different from the ground truth feedback. You should avoid coming up with similar hallucinations in your response. If you think the example response is correct and has made progress, no revision is needed and your should **directly output the example response verbatim**. Otherwise, you should modify the example response\u2019s thinking process/plan/action to be consistent with the environment feedback. Specifically, you should: 1. **Incorporate all relevant details from the feedback** into the example response and then **improve its accuracy and progress**. Be detailed when adding information from the feedback into the", "response verbatim**. Otherwise, you should modify the example response\u2019s thinking process/plan/action to be consistent with the environment feedback.

Be detailed when adding information from the feedback into the response. 2. The final refined response should **read as a standalone answer, without saying its a revision or referencing the feedback section**.

Keep the same tone and format as the example response. Ensure the final plan/action is logically consistent with your (refined) thinking process.

Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a \"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate \"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech gen- eration. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance com- parable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time interaction1. 1 Introduction Speech has emerged as a more natural and fundamental modality for human-computer interaction, leading to growing emphasis on spoken language models (SLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These models facilitate seamless communication by processing and generating audio-based inputs and outputs. A key component enhancing their capability is the integration of thinking, particularly through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes and its extensions [6, 7, 8, 9], as implemented in frameworks like Think-Before-Speak (TBS) [6, 10, 11]. This approach enables models to decompose complex tasks into step-by-step reasoning sequences, thereby improving interpretability and performance in dialogue systems. However, generating complete CoT sequences often introduces significant latency, which hinders real-time applications. Recent efforts to reduce reasoning latency have garnered significant attention [12, 13]. These methods explore \"think-while-speaking\" paradigms, where models interleave \u2217Equal contribution \u2020corresponding authors: tianfei@stepfun.com 1Our code is available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-MPS arXiv:2510.09592v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint. Work in progress. thinking and response tokens. The Large Language Model (LLM) continuously switches between think and response modes. It first generates several think tokens, then produces several response tokens based on them. These response tokens are sent to the Text To Speech (TTS) system for speech synthesis. While the speech is synthesizing, the LLM continues to generate more think tokens. However, this interleaving disrupts semantic coherence by forcing the model to frequently switch between thinking and response generation, potentially degrading the performance. In fact, the human brain provides a biological analogy for efficient parallel processing. Cognitive neuroscience reveals that thinking and speaking involve distinct brain areas [14, 15]. Speech does not follow a rigid \"think-then-speak\" sequence or interleaved sequence. Crucially, it exhibits an incremental nature where later parts of a thought are still being processed while the initial parts of the utterance are already being spoken", "neuroscience reveals that thinking and speaking involve distinct brain areas [14, 15]. Speech does not follow a rigid \"think-then-speak\" sequence or interleaved sequence. Crucially, it exhibits an incremental nature where later parts of a thought are still being processed while the initial parts of the utterance are already being spoken [16]. Inspired by this, we introduce Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a novel architecture for enabling SLMs to \"think\" and \"speak\" in a concurrent and integrated manner. The core of MPS is a dual-brain framework that operates analogously to the human cognitive-speech system. One LLM acts as a central \"Formulation Brain\", continuously generating an internal stream of thought. The other functions as an Articulation Brain, which receives this thought stream in segments and generates the corresponding spoken output. The Formulation Brain does not need to complete a full reasoning chain before the Articulation Brain begins. Instead, the ongoing thinking process actively sets the pace and provides the contextual guidance for the Articulation Brain, allowing it to vocalize fluently even as the underlying thoughts are still being formed and refined by the Formulation Brain. This mind-paced mechanism ensures that the spoken output is not only grounded in a thinking process but also maintains semantic coherence, closely mimicking the natural human process of thinking while speaking. Furthermore, we propose a think-incomplete Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) method to enable the Articulation Brain to respond based on incomplete thinking content. The experimental results on benchmarks such as mathematical reasoning, dialogue, and question-answering, prove that compared to methods that answer directly without thinking, or existing methods that think while speaking, the proposed MPS method effectively utilizes the thinking process and continuous semantic context, obtaining more accurate and higher-quality responses. Compared to TBS method, the proposed MPS significantly reduces response latency while maintaining performance. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose an MPS architecture that enables SLMs to achieve human-like think-while-speaking capabilities. This method significantly reduces the latency of the CoT process while maintaining the semantic coherence of the LLM. Consequently, the LLM leverages the CoT content to deliver superior performance. (2) We develop a think-incomplete SFT to train LLMs to generate responses based on partial thinking processes, thereby enabling them to perform think-while-speaking. (3) We evaluate two distinct MPS architectures: Speak-First and Think-First, against baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed think-while-speaking MPS method significantly outperforms both the direct response approach without a thinking process and exist- ing interleaved think-while-speaking methods. Compared to the TBS architecture, our method substantially reduces response latency while maintaining the quality of the LLM\u2019s responses. (4) Our proposed MPS architecture mimics the neuroscientific mechanisms of human thinking and speaking, transcending the structural limitations of existing interleaved think-while-speaking 2 Preprint.

It provides the research community with a reference paradigm for subsequent studies on anthropomorphic, real-time dialogue systems 2 Related Work 2.1 Spoken Language Models Spoken Language Models (SLMs) accept user speech input and generate speech output, enabling real-time speech dialogue with users. Since the LLM backbone is typically trained in the text domain, directly generating speech tokens", "reference paradigm for subsequent studies on anthropomorphic, real-time dialogue systems 2 Related Work 2.1 Spoken Language Models Spoken Language Models (SLMs) accept user speech input and generate speech output, enabling real-time speech dialogue with users. Since the LLM backbone is typically trained in the text domain, directly generating speech tokens presents a challenge [12]. Most current SLMs first generate text tokens and then generate speech. This is achieved through two primary methods: one approach uses the LLM to output text, which is then synthesized into speech by an additional TTS model [17, 18]. Another method employs the LLM to generate interleaved text and audio tokens, where each output chunk contains a fixed number of text tokens and speech tokens, and a speech decoder directly synthesizes the speech signal [19, 2]. For example, Step-Audio 2 produces output in the ta4 format, which means it outputs one text token followed by four audio tokens. This chunk of output is then passed through a speech detokenizer to obtain the speech signal [2]. 2.2 Reason for SLMs Although explicit CoT has been proven helpful in text LLMs, most SLMs still lack CoT capability. One reason is that audio and text have different structures; another reason is that directly synthesizing CoT into speech increases the confusion of responses, while generating silent CoT introduces significant latency, which becomes unreasonable in daily conversations. Some studies introduce the reasoning ability into Audio LLMs [12]. For example, Xie et al. have proposed an audio CoT reasoning dataset to fine-tune models [20]. Some studies use reinforcement learning, such as GRPO [21], to fine-tune models and enhance their reasoning ability [22, 23]. However, these studies remain limited to audio-in-text-out Audio LLMs, not SLMs that can engage in dialogue with humans. In [2], Step-Audio 2, which takes speech as input and output, using CoT and reinforcement learning to improve the response qualities, is proposed. Step-Audio 2 offers a solution for introducing explicit reasoning into SLMs. Some methods achieve simultaneous thinking and speaking by segmenting CoT content and response content, using the LLM to generate interleaved think tokens and response tokens [12, 13]. However, this approach differs from the LLM\u2019s original response generation format. The LLM needs to continuously switch between think mode and response mode, which disrupts semantic coherence and affects its performance. 3 Method This section first outlines the conventional TBS-based SLM. We then present the proposed MPS method. We also introduce the think-incomplete SFT, which is designed to teach LLMs the think-while-speaking capability. 3.1 Think Before Speaking The architecture of TBS-based SLM is shown in Figure 1. To enhance the reasoning ability of SLM, the TBS paradigm, after receiving user speech Xspc and optional text instructions Xtxt, first generates step-by-step CoT tokens Y cot \u2208RTc, and then generates the response tokens Y res \u2208RTr, 3 Preprint.

For the sake of conciseness, we remove the input text, which is optional in SLMs. The TBS SLM first generates the full CoT and then produces response tokens. where Tc and Tr denote the number of CoT tokens and response tokens, respectively. This can be divided into two processes: the thinking process and the speaking process. The thinking process can be written as: P\u03b8l(Y cot|\u27e8Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9) = Tc Y t=1 P\u03b8l(Y cot t |\u27e8Y cot 1:t\u22121, Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9), (1) where \u03b8l denotes the parameters of the SLM. After that, the LLM generates response tokens for speaking, which can be formulated as: P\u03b8l(Y res|\u27e8Y cot, Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9) = Tr Y t=1 P\u03b8l(Y res t |\u27e8Y res 1:t\u22121, Y cot 1:Tc, Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9). (2) Through this method, the task is decomposed into a step-by-step process. Additionally, by intro- ducing CoT tokens, it enables more Transformer forward operations and thus gives LLM a deeper inference depth [24, 25]. 3.2 Architecture In the human brain, speech production is not a monolithic process but the result of two highly specialized and collaborative systems. The first, a network centered around the prefrontal-temporal cortex, is responsible for high-level cognitive functions such as conceptualization, logical reasoning, and content planning. Subsequently, a second system, primarily involving the motor cortex and subcortical pathways, translates these abstract thoughts into natural language for articulation, enabling fluent speech. These two systems operate in parallel, with the cognitive system continuously supplying thinking content to the articulatory system, creating a natural flow where the mind paces speech [14, 15]. Inspired by this, we abstract this mechanism of separated \"formulation\" and \"articulation\" into our model architecture. Instead of relying on a single LLM to handle both thinking and speaking, we propose a dual-brain system composed of two distinct LLMs. Our proposed framework, illustrated in Figure 2, leverages a dual-LLM architecture consisting of a Formulation Brain LLM and an Articulation Brain LLM. The Formulation Brain LLM is dedicated to user intent understanding and performs deliberate CoT reasoning, with its internal process materialized as \"think tokens\". Subsequently, the Articulation Brain LLM converts this 4 Preprint. Work in progress. First, the problem ... Then it says ... First, the problem ... Robin's hair.... How long ...?

For the sake of conciseness, we remove the input text, which is optional in SLMs. We demonstrate the process from step i to step i+1 when generating think segments and response segments. The Formulation Brain LLM continuously generates the think segments. The newly generated think segment and the response segment from the previous step are both added as the prefix to the Articulation Brain LLM, pacing the Articulation Brain LLM to produce response segment correspondingly. structured reasoning and the dialogue context into natural language, producing the final \"response tokens\" for spoken output. Formulation Brain: The Formulation Brain\u2019s operating mode is identical to that of TBS Audio LLMs but with only the thinking process. After receiving user input Xspc and Xtxt, it aims to generate the step-by-step CoT tokens Y cot \u2208RTc. We use the tokens <think> and </think> to mark the beginning and end of the CoT. This process can be formulated as (1). In the MPS architecture, we do not wait for the Formulation Brain to complete the entire CoT before the Articulation Brain starts speaking. We divide the CoT tokens Y cot into N segments, denoted as [Scot 1 , Scot 2 , ..., Scot N ]. Each time the Formulation Brain produces a think segment Scot n , we feed the segment to the Articulation Brain, which then generates a response segment based on the current think segment and historical thinking and response contents. After the Formulation Brain LLM finishes CoT segments, it stops generating response tokens as we do not require the Formulation Brain to speak. Articulation Brain: The Articulation Brain accepts the same user input as the Formulation Brain. After obtaining the current think segment Scot n from the Formulation Brain, we concatenate it with the historical think segments [Scot 1 , Scot 2 , ..., Scot n\u22121], placing <think> and </think> at the beginning and the end, and then append the historical response segments, which are defined as [Sres 1 , Sres 2 , ..., Sres n\u22121]. This allows the Articulation Brain to continue generating the subsequent response content. After that, we use a streaming TTS model to synthesize speech in real-time. The Articulation Brain\u2019s output is incremental. For every think segment that the Formulation Brain produces, the Articulation Brain generates a segment of the response Sres n . This process can be written as: P\u03b8l(Sres|\u27e8Scot, Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9) = N Y n=1 P\u03b8l(Sres n |\u27e8Sres 1:n\u22121, Scot 1:n, Xspc, Xtxt\u27e9), (3) 5 Preprint. Work in progress. When the Formulation Brain just begins its thinking, the Articulation Brain can only generate a response segment based on a small amount of CoT. The response segment it generates at this stage may be of lower quality. As the Formulation Brain\u2019s thinking content increases, the Articulation Brain receives more CoT content, and it subsequently", "just begins its thinking, the Articulation Brain can only generate a response segment based on a small amount of CoT. The response segment it generates at this stage may be of lower quality. As the Formulation Brain\u2019s thinking content increases, the Articulation Brain receives more CoT content, and it subsequently generates responses of increasingly higher quality. Compared with existing think-while-speaking methods that use a single LLM to predict interleaved think and response tokens, thereby forcibly interrupting and splitting the originally continuous think and response content [12, 13], our method adopts a dual-brain design consisting of the Formulation Brain and the Articulation Brain. From the perspectives of the Formulation Brain and the Articulation Brain, both are classic TBS LLMs that, after receiving user input, first generate step-by-step CoT content and then generate response content conditioned on the CoT, thereby greatly ensuring the semantic coherence of the LLM output. By allowing the Formulation Brain to pace the Articulation Brain, our method achieves a human-like think-while-speaking process. 3.3 Think-incomplete SFT Since the proposed MPS method does not change the input-output patterns of the classic LLM for the individual Formulation Brain and Articulation Brain, the proposed MPS, unlike existing think-while-listening methods [12, 13], does not require repretraining the LLM. To ensure that the Articulation Brain LLM possesses the ability to accept incomplete think content and produce reasonable output, we introduce think-incomplete SFT. In the construction of training data, we randomly retain the content of the first L steps of the step-by-step CoT, delete the subsequent CoT content, then place this incomplete CoT with <think> and </think> tokens at the beginning and end, concatenate it with the groundtruth response, and use it as the next-token-prediction training objective for the LLM [26]. During the inference stage, we use segments with a fixed number of tokens. We set Tc and Tr to 80 and 100 respectively. We use the output format of Step-Audio 2, specifically the ta4 format, which generates one text token followed by four speech tokens, thus every 100 response tokens contain 20 text tokens and 80 speech tokens. We also attempt to use the same segment division strategy as in the think-incomplete SFT phase, but we find that it does not bring improvement; on the contrary, it introduces uncontrollable latency due to the variable length of each CoT step. We also try using a fixed token count strategy for dividing the CoT during the think-incomplete SFT phase, but it does not yield performance improvements either. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Settings The LLM backbone used in this paper is Step-Audio 2, and its parameter settings refer to [2]. The LLMs in Formulation Brain and Articulation brain share the same parameters. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on tasks requiring reasoning, we use Spoken-MQA, a mathematical reasoning dataset [27]. We use accuracy as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, to validate the method\u2019s effectiveness on general dialogue tasks, we introduce URO-Bench, which contains several subtasks such as daily dialogue, emotion recognition, paralinguistic information, and question-answering [28].

Work in progress. other tasks, we use GPT-score, generated by GPT-4o-mini and ranging from 0 to 100, to evaluate response quality. To accommodate the latency requirements of different application scenarios, we implement two distinct MPS paradigms: \u2022 Think-First, denoted as MPS-thkfirst: The Formulation Brain LLM first generates Tc think tokens, after which the Articulation Brain LLM generates Tr response tokens and synthesizes speech. Under this setting, the latency is Tc plus the buffer size of streaming TTS, which is significantly lower than the latency required for the TBS structure to generate a complete Chain-of-Thought. \u2022 Speak-First, denoted as MPS-spkfirst: The Articulation Brain LLM first generates Tr response tokens, while simultaneously, the Formulation Brain LLM begins generating think tokens. The Formulation Brain LLM completes generating Tc think tokens before the speech synthesized from the Tr response tokens finishes playing. In this configuration, the latency is solely the buffer size of the streaming TTS, meaning the model can be considered to respond directly with near-zero latency. Additionally, we compare the proposed method with two approaches that use the same LLM backbone as in this paper: Think-Before-Speaking (MPS-tbs) and direct response without thinking (MPS-wo/thk), to validate the effectiveness of our proposed think-while-speaking methodology. 4.2 Data Construction We begin with real-world user queries as our seed set. To ensure topical diversity and sufficient scale, we employ GPT-4o [29] for transcription and augmentation of these queries. These augmented queries are then used as user prompts to distill dialogue data with native CoT from the DeepSeek-R1 model [11]. However, the raw data generated by DeepSeek-R1, a text-centric model, presents two critical challenges for spoken dialogue applications: (1) Text-specific stylizations, such as Markdown formatting and emojis, which are incompatible with speech synthesis. (2) The CoT data reflects complete, turn-based reasoning chains, a format unsuitable for training the model to respond from partial thoughts. When the CoT generated by the LLM exhibits some incomplete, its performance is affected. To address these challenges, we implement a fine-grained data processing pipeline: \u2022 Compatibility Processing: We discard samples containing Markdown formatting or multi-item lists that cannot be naturally rendered in speech. For samples containing emojis, we employ Qwen-72B-Instruct [30] to remove these elements while preserving the plain text content. \u2022 CoT Pruning: To train the model to respond stably with only partial CoT, we augment the data by randomly deleting some reasoning paragraphs. This operation is performed in a way that generally preserves the overall logic of the CoT. Crucially, to maintain the stylistic distribution of the original DeepSeek CoT, we neither delete individual sentences within a paragraph nor use an LLM to rewrite the content of the remaining parts. This ensures that the preserved paragraphs are stylistically and distributionally consistent with the source model. 7 Preprint. Work in progress.

It can be seen that the proposed MPS- thkfirst method exceeds the MPS-wo/thk method and all baseline methods, including the think-while- speaking Mini-Omni-Reasoner, in all evaluation tasks. The results proves that the proposed method effectively utilizes the thinking process, achieving more intelligent response. Compared to Mini- Omni-Reasoner, the MPS method maintains semantic coherence and achieves better performance.

One possible explanation is that reason- ing tasks require more textual analysis. The MPS-thkfirst method, by using each think seg- ment to pace the generation of a corresponding response segment, implicitly achieves semantic alignment, enabling the model to better utilize contextual information for response generation. The MPS-spkfirst method experiences some per- formance degradation because it initially out- puts a response segment without utilizing any think segments. This impact is particularly pronounced in tasks involving direct arithmetic compu- tation. For reasoning tasks, experimental observations indicate that the initial phase of the LLM\u2019s 8 Preprint.

Consequently, this initial portion of the CoT content has a limited effect on the final response. As a result, MPS-spkfirst is minimally affected in reasoning tasks, and its performance remains nearly identical to that of MPS-thkfirst. Experimental results on Spoken-MQA demonstrate that the proposed method significantly leverages CoT to achieve more intelligent responses. Furthermore, compared to TBS methods, our think-while-speaking approach achieves comparable performance, with significantly lower CoT latency as analysed in Section 4.1. To demonstrate the latency differences between the proposed method and baseline approaches, we select four models from Table 1 that include a thinking process: Mini-Omni-Reasoner, MPS-tbs, MPS-thkfirst, and MPS-spkfirst. We calculate the number of extra tokens generated by the model from the end of the user\u2019s question to the generation of the first response token on Spoken-MQA. The results are shown in Table 2. It can be observed that compared to MPS-tbs, MPS-thkfirst achieves higher accuracy while exhibiting significantly lower response latency. Although the accuracy of MPS-spkfirst is slightly lower than that of MPS-tbs and MPS-thkfirst, its response is without latency. Furthermore, compared to Mini-Omni-Reasoner, which uses interleaved think and response tokens to achieve think-while-speaking, the proposed MPS methods achieve higher accuracy. Notably, the MPS-spkfirst attains this superior accuracy with zero latency. This indicates that MPS-spkfirst can play a more critical role in real-time dialogue scenarios with low-latency requirements. An example of the output of MPS-spkfirst is shown in Appendix A.1. 9 Preprint. Work in progress. 4.3.2 Evaluation on Speech-to-speech conversation Table 3 shows the results", "this superior accuracy with zero latency. This indicates that MPS-spkfirst can play a more critical role in real-time dialogue scenarios with low-latency requirements. An example of the output of MPS-spkfirst is shown in Appendix A.1. 9 Preprint. Work in progress. 4.3.2 Evaluation on Speech-to-speech conversation Table 3 shows the results of different methods on URO-Bench. It can be observed that MPS-thkfirst achieves higher performance than MPS-tbs on nearly all tasks and on average, under lower response latency. This may also be related to the implicit semantic alignment performed by MPS-thkfirst. Due to generating an initial response segment without prior thinking, MPS-spkfirst performs slightly worse than MPS-thkfirst, but still significantly outperforms the direct response method MPS-wo/thk. Nevertheless, MPS-spkfirst features lowest response latency as analysed in Section 4.1, and its response performance remains close to or even better than that of MPS-tbs in some tasks, making it more suitable for scenarios requiring faster feedback. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MPS method maintains high performance on dialogue tasks, achieving performance comparable to TBS models while operating at significantly lower latency. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes the MPS method, which enables SLMs to possess the ability to think while speaking. Inspired by the human thinking and response mechanism, we use a Formulation Brain LLM to continuously generate think segments, pacing the Articulation Brain LLM to utilize historical and current think segments, as well as historical responses, to generate current response segment, ensuring semantic coherence. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and speech conversation tasks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms direct response methods and existing think-while-speaking methods. It achieves performance comparable or even better than methods that complete thinking before responding, while greatly reducing response latency. The proposed method breaks through the limitations of existing interleaved thinking and response-based think-while-speaking methods and provides an effective reference for researching real-time dialogue consistent with human thinking and response mechanisms. 6 Acknowledgement We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Liang Zhao and Chengyuan Yao for their insightful suggestions and constructive discussions regarding the design of the model\u2019s thinking mechanism.

Kaijian Zou\u2217 Aaron Xiong Yunxiang Zhang Frederick Zhang Yueqi Ren Jirong Yang Ayoung Lee Shitanshu Bhushan Lu Wang University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Website: https://LiveOIBench.github.io ABSTRACT Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limi- tations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned contin- uous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonethe- less falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website. 1 INTRODUCTION Coding has emerged as a critical domain for LLMs (Zhuo et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024), with coding benchmarks serving as essential tools to evaluate LLMs\u2019 algorithmic reasoning capabilities as these models continue advancing through inference-time scaling techniques (Li et al., 2022a; Kojima et al., 2023; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; OpenAI et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025b). However, rapid improvements in model capabilities have led to saturation of traditional coding benchmarks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), prompting the adoption of competitive coding benchmarks (Li et al., 2022a; Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Li et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024) such as LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) and CodeELO (Quan et al., 2025), which leverage problems from platforms like Codeforces for their complexity \u2217Correspondence to zkjzou@umich.edu 1 arXiv:2510.09595v1 [cs.AI] 10 Oct 2025 Preprint 10k 20k 30k 40k 50k 60k 70k Avg Complete Tokens / Problem 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Human Percentile GPT-5 GPT-OSS-120B-high Gemini-2.5-Pro GPT-OSS-120B GPT-OSS-20B-high GPT-o3-mini-high GPT-OSS-20B Seed-OSS Gemini-2.5-Flash Qwen3-32B deepseek-R1 R1-Llama-70B GPT-4.1 deepseek-v3 Bronze (top 50% human) Silver (top 25% human) Gold (top 10% human) Most token efficient Thinking Non-thinking 0.4k 0.5k 0.6k 0.7k 0.8k 0.9k 1k 15% 20% 25% Qwen2.5-Coder-32B Qwen3-32B NT Mistral-Large Qwen2.5-72B Llama-3.3-70B Llama-4-Scout Codestral-22B Llama-3.1-8B DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite", "GPT-OSS-120B-high Gemini-2.5-Pro GPT-OSS-120B GPT-OSS-20B-high GPT-o3-mini-high GPT-OSS-20B Seed-OSS Gemini-2.5-Flash Qwen3-32B deepseek-R1 R1-Llama-70B GPT-4.1 deepseek-v3 Bronze (top 50% human) Silver (top 25% human) Gold (top 10% human) Most token efficient Thinking Non-thinking 0.4k 0.5k 0.6k 0.7k 0.8k 0.9k 1k 15% 20% 25% Qwen2.5-Coder-32B Qwen3-32B NT Mistral-Large Qwen2.5-72B Llama-3.3-70B Llama-4-Scout Codestral-22B Llama-3.1-8B DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite Qwen2.5-Coder-7B Figure 1: LiveOIBench. Average human percentile across all contests versus average completion tokens per problem. The dashed boxes highlight the lower performance range of non-thinking LLMs. OpenAI models lie on the token-efficiency frontier, achieving higher human percentile with fewer tokens. Despite improvements, all evaluated models remain below the Gold medal threshold (top 10% human performance), indicating substantial room for progress. and ease of verification. Despite their strengths, these benchmarks have notable weaknesses: (1) overestimation of LLMs\u2019 performance due to high false-positive rates using incomplete test suites (Li et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2024), (2) insufficient difficulty granularity and lacking exceptionally challenging questions (Jain et al., 2024; Quan et al., 2025), (3) usage of external APIs for evaluation, restricting reproducibility and accessibility (Jain et al., 2024; Quan et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c), (4) reliance on coarse pass rates as the sole evaluation metric, which misses the opportunity to gain insights on nuanced model capabilities (Jain et al., 2024; Li et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2024), and (5) infrequent or costly updates due to the extensive human annotations and computational resources required (Wang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). To address these gaps, we introduce LiveOIBench, the first comprehensive competitive coding benchmark constructed directly from Informatics Olympiads tasks, featuring expert-designed private tests, which will be made publicly available to support reproducible evaluation along with fine-grained scoring rubrics. Compared to previous benchmarks (Jain et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Li et al., 2022a; Quan et al., 2025) and concurrent work (Li et al., 2025c; Zheng et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) in Table 1, LiveOIBench features the following key advancements: 1. Expert-curated Tasks with Fine-grained Subtask Rubrics. We curate problems, test cases, and scoring rubrics directly from the official websites of 14 Informatics Olympiads. This comprehensive test suite eliminates high false-positive rates common in previous benchmarks (Li et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2024). Additionally, each task includes subtasks with scoring rubrics, enabling nuanced insights into model capabilities. 2. Direct Human Contestant Comparisons. Official results from top human competitors are collected, allowing direct and informative benchmarking against human-level performance. 3. Continuous, Contamination-free Updates. Updates with newly released Olympiad tasks maintain benchmark freshness and minimize data contamination risks, supporting continuous monitoring of LLM coding capabilities on challenging programming problems. 4. Integrated Offline Evaluation System. We develop a self-contained evaluation judge, enabling fully offline and reproducible model evaluation without relying on external APIs or online platforms, significantly enhancing accessibility and reproducibility. In total, LiveOIBench comprises 403 rigorously curated problems sourced from 72 contests across 14 Informatics Olympiads, each accompanied by an average of 60 expert-written", "We develop a self-contained evaluation judge, enabling fully offline and reproducible model evaluation without relying on external APIs or online platforms, significantly enhancing accessibility and reproducibility.

Using LiveOIBench, we evaluate 32 leading models, revealing that proprietary models maintain a substantial performance advantage. In particular, GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025b) achieves an average human percentile of 82, while also exhibiting remarkable token efficiency by reaching this performance with fewer than 20K reasoning tokens, positioning it on the efficiency frontier (Figure 1). Among open-weight alternatives, Seed-OSS (ByteDance Seed Team, 2025) achieves the 54th percentile and Qwen3-32B (Yang et al., 2025b) reaches the 42nd percentile, both demonstrating significant performance gains 2 Preprint Dataset Difficulty Updates Expert Test Cases Offline Eval Subtasks Human Percentile HumanEval \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 APPS \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 CodeContests \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 TACO \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 LiveCodeBench \u2713 \u2717 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 USACO \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2717 \u2717 CODEELO \u2713 \u2713(hidden) \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 OI-Bench \u2717 \u2713(unofficial) \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 LiveCodeBench-Pro \u2713 \u2713(hidden) \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 HLCE \u2717 \u2713(hidden) \u2717 \u2717 \u2713 AetherCode \u2713 \u2713(unofficial) \u2717 \u2717 \u2717 LiveOIBench (Ours) \u2713 \u2713(official and public) \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Table 1: Comparison with existing coding datasets. LiveOIBench consists of continuously updated competitive coding problems from recent Informatics Olympiads, spanning various difficulty levels. Unlike previous benchmarks that generated test cases using predefined rules or LLMs, LiveOIBench features expert-curated private test cases sourced directly from official competition organizers. It also provides an accessible offline evaluation platform, detailed subtask rubrics for fine-grained assessment, and official human contestant rankings for precise human-model comparisons. from additional reasoning tokens. Additionally, GPT-OSS-120B (OpenAI et al., 2025) attains the 60th percentile, effectively narrowing the performance gap with GPT-5 and highlighting significant progress in open-weight model capabilities. Moreover, examining performance across different algorithms reveals current models\u2019 weaknesses in algorithms like dynamic programming, which demand creative observation and hierarchical reasoning. Additionally, detailed reasoning trace analyses reveal that high-performing models strategically allocate more tokens to focused analysis rather than excessive exploration, underscoring that carefully managed reasoning behaviors are crucial for robust performance on challenging tasks. In summary, we make the following key contributions: \u2022 (Data) Curate and release a comprehensive, high-quality competitive coding benchmark with expert-crafted problems, hidden test suites, and integrated human contestant results. \u2022 (Evaluation) Provide a robust local evaluation framework with private test cases and detailed subtask scoring rubrics, enabling accessible, fine-grained human-model comparisons. \u2022 (Benchmarking Results) Conduct extensive benchmarking and detailed performance analy- sis of 32 leading open-source and proprietary models. \u2022 (Analyses) Perform extensive analyses such as evaluating model performance across diverse algorithms, detailed reasoning trace analyses, examination of solution submission outcomes, and assessments of model performance under inference-time scaling. 2 RELATED WORK The early code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) mainly focus on the basic Python programs, which, for a long time, have been the standard ways", "of solution submission outcomes, and assessments of model performance under inference-time scaling. 2 RELATED WORK The early code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) mainly focus on the basic Python programs, which, for a long time, have been the standard ways to evaluate the code generation capability of LLMs. However, as the capability of LLMs evolves, simple benchmarks like HumanEval can no longer satisfy the benchmarking needs. Researchers have started developing more realistic and challenging benchmarks (Zhuo et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2023). Specifically, DS1000 (Lai et al., 2022) and ARCADE (Yin et al., 2023) consist of data science problems in Python. BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2024) collects code generation tasks from Stack Overflow, which involves more complex instructions and diverse function calls. The SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) takes one step further and tests models\u2019 ability to solve real-world GitHub issues. This line of work emphasizes evaluating LLMs\u2019 ability to effectively implement, debug, and reason through complex real-world coding tasks. In addition to real-world application benchmarks, there is another line of work: competitive programming benchmarks (Li et al., 2022a; Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Jain et al., 2024; Quan et al., 2025), which test the reasoning ability of models to solve challenging coding tasks within the specified time and memory constraints. All the previous competitive programming benchmarks 3 Preprint collect problems from online coding platforms such as Codeforces and AtCoder, which do not release private test cases. The lack of sufficient private test cases may cause many false-positive solutions (Li et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2023). Li et al. (2022a) augment test cases by mutating existing test inputs. Liu et al. (2023) leverages both LLM-based and mutation-based strategies to augment test cases with predefined rules. Even with over 200 additional tests per problem, Li et al. (2022a) shows there still exists nearly 50% false-positive rates. Other work (Quan et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c) tries to solve this problem by creating a platform to submit LLM-generated solutions directly to the Codeforces platform. Although this approach ensures that solutions are tested on the whole test set, its dependency on the online platform limits its accessibility to the research community, as large-scale evaluations involving thousands of submissions can overload platform servers. To solve the above problem, we collect problems from the official websites of many informatics Olympiads around the world. Most informatics Olympiads release their complete test set, which is curated carefully by the organizing committees. We are one of the first works to leverage problems from different informatics Olympiads and evaluate the models\u2019 performance against human contes- tants. Prior research by Shi et al. (2024) exclusively used USACO problems with pass rate as the sole evaluation metric. Concurrent benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench Pro (Zheng et al., 2025), HLCE (Li et al., 2025c), OI-Bench (Zhu et al., 2025), and AetherCode (Wang et al., 2025), also incor- porate competitive programming tasks from sources", "Shi et al. (2024) exclusively used USACO problems with pass rate as the sole evaluation metric. Concurrent benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench Pro (Zheng et al., 2025), HLCE (Li et al., 2025c), OI-Bench (Zhu et al., 2025), and AetherCode (Wang et al., 2025), also incor- porate competitive programming tasks from sources like ICPC and IOI. However, LiveCodeBench Pro and HLCE primarily evaluate using Codeforces, limiting their accessibility. OI-Bench relies mostly on private, non-English school contests without continuous updates, while AetherCode uses LLM-generated tests and extensive human annotation with pass rate evaluation only. In contrast, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage across diverse Olympiads, allows easy updates by directly collecting official test cases, and employs detailed evaluation metrics including subtask rubrics and human percentile comparisons. 3 LIVEOIBENCH CONSTRUCTION To construct LiveOIBench, we follow a clearly defined, step-by-step process combining automated data collection methods with manual verification to ensure dataset quality. Competition Selection and Task Collection: We first curate a comprehensive list of globally recognized international Informatics Olympiads and selectively incorporate national contests from top-performing IOI countries where English task statements are available (See Table A5). For each selected contest, we develop a custom crawler that systematically extracts English task statements (See Appendix A.5) directly from official competition websites, capturing details such as time and memory constraints, subtask specifications, test cases, official solutions, and contestant rankings. When official sites lack complete or up-to-date information, we supplement the data by retrieving missing details from established online platforms such as CSES1 and LibreOJ2. To mitigate potential contamination from pre-training datasets, we strictly limit our dataset to contests held in 2023 and after. Additionally, we provide full descriptions of each competition along with official websites in Appendix A.6, ensuring selected contests have extensive historical data, consistent participant numbers, and regularly hosted events. Our benchmark will be continuously updated by leveraging monthly or annual problem releases from 14 actively maintained competition websites, allowing us to regularly expand our dataset with new contests and maintain an active leaderboard using a website similar to Figure A1. Markdown Conversion and Quality Assurance: Given that many contests provide task statements exclusively as PDF documents, we employ Marker3 to automatically convert these PDFs into markdown format. We further utilize Gemini-2.0-Flash to automatically verify and correct these markdown texts. To ensure conversion accuracy, we manually inspect a sample of 40 tasks before batch processing. Additionally, we verify our evaluation judge and crawled test cases by executing the official solutions from contest organizers, using these solutions as the ground truth to confirm test-case correctness and the robustness of our evaluation judge. 1https://cses.fi 2https://loj.ac 3https://github.com/datalab-to/marker 4 Preprint Metadata Enrichment: We enhance the dataset with supplementary metadata, including difficulty and algorithm tags such as dynamic programming and greedy, crawled from solved.ac4 and Luogu5. Tasks and metadata are matched using competition dates, task titles, and problem identifiers. More details can be found in Appendix A.3. Contestant Matching and Codeforces Ratings: Beyond raw human contestant results, contestants are automatically linked to their respective Codeforces profiles based on their names, user IDs, and countries, while contestants whose profiles cannot be confidently matched", "competition dates, task titles, and problem identifiers. More details can be found in Appendix A.3. Contestant Matching and Codeforces Ratings: Beyond raw human contestant results, contestants are automatically linked to their respective Codeforces profiles based on their names, user IDs, and countries, while contestants whose profiles cannot be confidently matched are skipped. Verified profiles are then queried via the Codeforces API to retrieve user ratings from 2022 to 2025. More details can be found in Appendix A.4 and Table A6. Ultimately, LiveOIBench comprises 403 rigorously curated problems from 72 competitions across 14 Informatics Olympiads, conducted between 2023 and 2025. The benchmark statistics are detailed in Table A4, with a detailed description of our dataset construction methodology provided in Appendix A and competition information in Appendix A.6. There are four characteristics that make our dataset challenging and unique compared to the existing coding datasets: \u2022 Challenging Problems with Subtasks. Expert-curated problems contain subtasks with distinct constraints, enabling precise evaluation through partial scoring. \u2022 Expert-Designed Private Tests. Includes expert-designed private tests rather than test cases generated by predefined rules or LLMs, ensuring evaluation free of false positives. \u2022 Direct Human Comparisons. Benchmarks LLM performance against human contestants using percentile ranks, medals, and Codeforces ELO ratings. \u2022 Live Updates. Continuously updated with recent contests to minimize data contamination. All 14 competitions described in Appendix A.6 in our benchmark will be updated. 4 BENCHMARKING RESULTS We evaluate a comprehensive set of 32 LLMs. These models are categorized into three groups based on their accessibility and \u201cthinking\u201d capabilities: proprietary LLMs, open-weight thinking LLMs, and open-weight non-thinking LLMs. More details about models can be found Appendix B. During inference, we sample 8 candidate solutions per model and pick the solution with the highest score (Jain et al., 2024; Quan et al., 2025). We adopt the following evaluation metrics: pass rate (Kulal et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021), relative score, human percentile, Olympics medal system, and Codeforces Elo (Quan et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). With subtask rubrics and human contestants results, we can calculate each model\u2019s total points in a contest, allowing precise comparisons to human contestants via percentile rankings and medal awards. The description of each metric can be found in Table 2 or Appendix C. In Table 2, we present benchmarking results for selected models that obtain the top performance in the corresponding categories of models. Full results for all evaluated models are included in Table A9. Proprietary LLMs remain dominant, yet open-weight models are narrowing the performance gap. Our findings indicate that proprietary LLMs continue to lead in competitive coding benchmarks. Specifically, GPT-5 achieves impressive results, securing gold medals in 50% of contests, winning medals of any type in 88.89% of contests, and outperforming an average of 81.76% of human contestants. Among open-source models tested, GPT-OSS-120B emerges as the strongest competitor. Under standard reasoning effort, GPT-OSS-120B achieves gold medals in 29.17% of contests and performs near the 60th percentile\u2014approximately 21.86 percentile points below GPT-5. Notably, with high reasoning effort, GPT-OSS-120B surpasses Gemini-2.5-Pro and trails GPT-5 by merely 9 percentile points.

Notably, the highest-performing GPT-5 achieves an impressive 81.76th percentile but still falls short of top human contestants, successfully solving only 63% of tasks in the benchmark. lower performance\u2014Qwen3-4B secures gold medals in only 1.39% of contests, while DeepSeek- R1-Distill-Llama-8B achieves no gold medals and ranks merely at the 3rd percentile. These results clearly demonstrate that achieving meaningful performance on competitive programming tasks in LiveOIBench requires LLMs with substantial reasoning capabilities. Even the leading GPT-5 model falls short of top-tier human contestants. Achieving a gold medal in every contest requires consistently surpassing the 90th percentile. Although GPT-5 demonstrates remarkable capabilities with a near 82nd percentile and a rating of 2414, its performance still lags behind elite human competitors. This highlights an ongoing challenge for LLMs in surpassing human expertise in competitive coding. Thinking models perform significantly better than non-thinking models. Models lacking extended thinking capabilities perform notably worse in our benchmark. GPT-4.1, the highest- performing non-thinking model evaluated, achieves results comparable only to Qwen3-14B. Figure 2: Parallel Scaling displays the Pass@k performance, illustrating how the success rate", "human expertise in competitive coding.

GPT-5 shows the highest sample efficiency and overall performance ceiling. Apart from GPT-4.1 and Deepseek-V3, all other non-thinking models fail to exceed a 10% pass rate, underscoring the critical importance of ex- tended thinking in addressing complex competi- tive coding tasks. Extending this analysis, we in- vestigate inference-time scaling techniques and find that both parallel (Chen et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2024) and sequential (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Snell et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025a) scaling methods significantly enhance coding capabili- ties. In Figure 2, parallel scaling identifies max- imum coding capacity but shows diminishing returns beyond a few attempts. While sequen- tial scaling, by increasing the reasoning budget, allows smaller models to approach larger-model performance in Figure A4, reinforcing our ear- lier observation on the importance of extended thinking capabilities.

Darker color indicates the model performs better on this particular tag compared to other tags. Models generally perform better on algorithm tags that involve straightforward application of standard formulas or well-known patterns. Comprehensive evaluation metrics provide deeper insights into model capabilities. Relying solely on pass rate can obscure key aspects of model performance. For example, GPT-OSS-120B achieves a higher pass rate (47.78%) compared to Gemini-2.5-Pro (44.46%); however, Gemini- 2.5-Pro consistently surpasses GPT-OSS-120B in both human percentile ranking and ELO rating, indicating stronger overall competitive coding proficiency. We recommend that practitioners and researchers adopt a multifaceted evaluation approach: use Gold and Medals to gauge contest- level success, Human Percentile to contextualize model performance relative to humans, ELO to assess coding skill within the broader competitive coding community, and Pass Rate to evaluate core problem-solving capability. Utilizing these metrics collectively ensures a balanced and comprehensive understanding of model strengths and limitations. Later subtasks are more challenging. We investigate how model performance is affected by the sequential position of subtasks within problems. Specifically, we segment all subtasks into five equal bins based on their relative positions and observe a consistent decline in model performance for subtasks appearing later in the sequence, as illustrated in Figure A2. This result is intuitive, as earlier subtasks typically impose stronger constraints on input variables, making them easier and prerequisites for subsequent subtasks. In contrast, later subtasks usually lack explicit constraints, requiring more generalized and optimized solutions. No evidence of temporal performance degradation. We examine the quarterly pass rates for four leading LLMs from Q1\u201923 through Q2\u201925 in Figure A3. Our analysis reveals no significant performance degradation coinciding with the models\u2019 knowledge cutoffs, nor any signs of benchmark contamination. A more comprehensive analysis is provided in Appendix E.1. 5 IN-DEPTH ANALYSES OF MODEL BEHAVIOR AND ERROR PATTERNS We first analyze algorithmic complexity to identify models\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, then explore their strategic reasoning behaviors, and finally investigate specific error patterns to pinpoint areas for model improvement. 5.1 ALGORITHMIC COMPLEXITY DETERMINES MODEL PERFORMANCE PATTERNS Models are generally proficient at algorithm tags that require basic mathematical procedures and minimal compositional reasoning. As shown in Table 3, all evaluated models consistently achieve higher pass rates on tasks categorized under implementation, mathematics, prefix sum, sorting, and graph traversal\u2014GPT-5 notably attains over 70% accuracy on most of these tags. Such tasks primarily depend on recognizing familiar solution templates or leveraging procedural knowledge obtained from training.

We categorized eight reasoning behaviors and divide them into five groups: Analysis (Algorithm/Proof analysis and Complexity Analysis), Planning (Problem Restatement and Subgoal Setting), Exploration (Backtracking and Dead-end recognition), Imple- mentation (Pseudo implementation), Verification (Test Case Verification). reasoning or succinct proofs, such as greedy methods and graph theory, where even top proprietary models like GPT-5 drop to around 60%. The greatest difficulties arise in tasks that require on-the- spot creative observations, intricate state designs, or hierarchical invariants\u2014particularly evident in dynamic programming (DP), segment trees (ST), and tree (TR) problems, where GPT-5\u2019s pass rate sharply decreases to approximately 47%, 56%, and 38%, respectively. To address these weaknesses, future work could explore curriculum-driven fine-tuning (Huang et al., 2025) using carefully designed synthetic datasets of complex graph, tree, and DP problems, encouraging models to internalize the recurrence relations, hierarchical invariants, and compositional reasoning patterns crucial to solving these more challenging algorithmic tasks. 5.2 REASONING TRACE ANALYSES: STRONGER MODELS ALLOCATE REASONING TOKENS MORE STRATEGICALLY To better understand how thinking models solve challenging competitive coding problems, we conduct a detailed analysis on models\u2019 reasoning traces. Inspired by prior work (Gandhi et al., 2025; Ahmad et al., 2025) on reasoning behavior analysis, we categorize models\u2019 reasoning traces into eight behaviors and classify them into five groups as shown in Figure 3. Each trace is segmented into shorter chunks and annotated using GPT-OSS-120B. More details on the annotation prompt and implementation can be found in Appendix E.3. GPT-OSS-120B increases exploration and analysis with problem difficulty, yet maintains stable exploration levels across reasoning budgets. In Figure 3a, on more challenging problems, GPT- OSS-120B-High devotes significantly more effort to exploration\u2014searching for viable solution paths\u2014and deeper problem analysis, simultaneously reducing the tokens spent on initial planning and verification. This indicates that initial problem structuring behaviors are typically conducted early and not revisited extensively once a potential solution path is identified. Notably, even when provided with increased reasoning budgets (from low to high reasoning effort), as", "deeper problem analysis, simultaneously reducing the tokens spent on initial planning and verification. This indicates that initial problem structuring behaviors are typically conducted early and not revisited extensively once a potential solution path is identified. Notably, even when provided with increased reasoning budgets (from low to high reasoning effort), as shown in Figure 3b, GPT-OSS-120B strategically allocates extra tokens toward analysis, implementation, and verification, rather than further exploration. By maintaining stable exploration levels despite increased reasoning resources, the model mitigates excessive pivoting, a critical behavior that could otherwise lead to inefficient or incomplete reasoning traces, or \u201cunderthink\u201d (Shojaee et al., 2025). 8 Preprint Stronger reasoning models exhibit reduced exploration, allocating more resources toward solution development and analysis. After problem difficulty and reasoning efforts, we further see, in Figure 3c and Figure A8, more capable models dedicate more reasoning tokens to problem understanding, structured planning, and detailed algorithmic analysis. Consequently, they spend less time pivoting to alternative paths, generating pseudo-implementations, or performing test-case verification. It highlights the future direction of effectively allocating models\u2019 problem analysis and exploration to avoid excessive pivoting and prevent \"underthinking\". Initial planning behaviors and subsequent verification steps play crucial roles in models produc- ing correct solutions. Building upon this observation, we also investigate which reasoning behaviors distinguish correct from incorrect solutions. As illustrated in Figure 3d, correct solutions exhibit increased planning behaviors, potentially explaining why exploration behaviors diminish\u2014well- structured planning facilitates clearly defined solution paths, reducing the need for exploratory detours. Additionally, correct solutions engage in verification behaviors more frequently, ensuring adequate solution checks. This increased verification slightly reduces the need for extensive analysis, as models rely less on continuous reevaluation once confident in their solution correctness. Notably, correct solutions include more verification because targeted end-checks consolidate successful tra- jectories; however, stronger models rely less on explicit verification overall due to robust upfront analysis and planning, which internalize many checks and reduce the need for post-hoc verification. Based on these insights, an important direction for future research is to optimize how models allocate reasoning effort across different cognitive behaviors. Specifically, exploring methods that strategically guide model attention toward structured initial planning and in-depth analysis\u2014while carefully balancing exploration to prevent excessive pivoting\u2014could substantially enhance both solution correctness and reasoning efficiency. Additionally, developing mechanisms that help models internalize verification during planning and analysis phases could reduce their dependence on explicit, post-hoc verification steps. Finally, creating automated techniques to dynamically adjust reasoning budgets and behaviors according to problem-specific factors like difficulty and algorithms may further boost the effectiveness of reasoning models in solving complex competitive programming tasks. 5.3 ERROR PATTERNS IN MODEL-GENERATED CODE SUBMISSIONS Stronger reasoning capabilities in models correlate with reduced failure rates, yet runtime errors remain a notable challenge. In Figure 4, we analyze the submission status distribution across six selected models to better understand LLMs\u2019 solutions and their associated error patterns.

The models are sorted based on performance from left to right. Solutions by stronger reasoning models show substantial reductions in failure types of time limit, memory limit, and compilation errors. As models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities, their solutions show sub- stantial reductions in failure types of time limit, memory limit, and compi- lation errors. However, runtime errors, although somewhat reduced, do not ex- perience as pronounced a decline, high- lighting persistent challenges in edge- case handling and execution robustness. We hypothesize that one possible rea- son top-performing models still exhibit relatively high runtime error rates could be their tendency to pursue more aggres- sive and optimized coding patterns, such as employing custom data structures, in-place transformations, and pointer arithmetic. These advanced techniques, while algorithmically sound, might inherently increase the potential for execution faults6, especially in edge scenarios. Interestingly, GPT-OSS-20B displays compilation error rates comparable to weaker, non-reasoning-intensive models. We attribute this unexpected result to its cautious approach: the model often declines to generate solutions when it anticipates insufficient reasoning time, thereby 6For instance, a simple algorithm like summing elements of an array becomes significantly more complex when highly optimized for memory access patterns using techniques such as loop unrolling and pragma directives in C++ (e.g., #pragma omp simd, #pragma unroll). 9 Preprint triggering compilation-related failures. These findings highlight a limitation in the reinforcement learning approaches employed by current models (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b), which predominantly use solution correctness as the sole reward, neglecting efficiency and memory management. Future training techniques could incorporate fine-grained reward signals targeting these attributes, enabling models to optimize not only for correctness but also for reliable and efficient code execution. 6 CONCLUSION In this work, we propose LiveOIBench, a comprehensive competitive coding benchmark featuring expert-curated OI-style tasks with detailed subtask rubrics, direct comparisons to human contestant performance, continuous updates with new Olympiad tasks to prevent contamination, and an offline evaluation system ensuring accessible and reproducible assessments. We extensively evaluate 32 models including both proprietary and open-weight models. Our results highlight that proprietary models, particularly GPT-5, achieve impressive results but fall short of top human contestants, who typically place above the 90th percentile. Among open-weight models, GPT-OSS, Seed-OSS, and Qwen-3-32B demonstrate significant progress, with GPT-OSS-120B notably narrowing the performance gap to proprietary alternatives. Further analyses reveal that current models particularly struggle with advanced algorithmic tasks, such as dynamic programming. Additionally, our reasoning trace analysis indicates that robust model performance relies on strategically allocating exploratory and analytical reasoning behaviors. Lastly, we find stronger models reduce common failures yet persistently face runtime errors due to optimized coding techniques, suggesting refined training for efficiency and memory management.

Bigcodebench: Benchmarking code generation with diverse function calls and complex instructions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.15877, 2024. A DATASET CONSTRUCTION A.1 TASK COLLECTION We identified multiple Informatics Olympiad competitions and gathered all contests held from 2023 onward, along with their official website information. We specifically focused on the post-2022 period to minimize potential contamination from model training data. In total, we collected 72 contests, 46 of which include results from human contestants. The detailed statistics can be found in Table A4 and Table A5. Contest Information Extraction: We developed a dedicated web crawler for each competition to extract task information directly from its official website. This includes task statements, test cases, 16 Preprint reference and unofficial solutions, code attachments, time and memory limits, and detailed subtask specifications. We also parsed the contestant results pages and reformatted them into standardized CSV files. To do this, we copied the raw webpage content into Gemini-2.5-Pro and prompted it to generate CSVs with normalized headers. Each file captures contestant names, countries, total and per-task scores, and awarded medals. After manual verification against the official data, we integrated the processed results into our contestant database. After integrating contestant results into our database, we determined medal thresholds as follows. For general contests, the Gold, Silver, and Bronze thresholds are defined by the lowest total scores among participants who received each respective medal. In contrast, for the USACO Bronze, Silver, and Gold contests, thresholds correspond to the minimum scores required to advance to the next competition level. In the case of the USACO Platinum contest, thresholds are based solely on the number of problems solved: solving exactly one problem earns a Bronze medal, two problems earn Silver, and solving more than two problems earns Gold. Missing Data: When the official website lacks complete or up-to-date contest information, we enhance our dataset by retrieving the missing details from reputable secondary platforms such as CSES and LibreOJ. These platforms host curated repositories of contest materials and metadata, and contain a substantial amount of user submissions along with their corresponding pass rates. Their widespread adoption within the competitive programming and informatics communities suggests high accuracy and reliability. For contests missing test", "secondary platforms such as CSES and LibreOJ. These platforms host curated repositories of contest materials and metadata, and contain a substantial amount of user submissions along with their corresponding pass rates. Their widespread adoption within the competitive programming and informatics communities suggests high accuracy and reliability. For contests missing test cases on the official site, we employ a parser to retrieve them from CSES and integrate them into our dataset. If official code solutions are absent or invalid, we obtain five user-submitted solutions from LibreOJ that achieved a 100% pass rate and include them in the dataset. Valid solutions from open-source Github repositories are also downloaded to enhance the dataset. By supplementing incomplete primary data with these established sources, we ensure our dataset maintains high standards of accuracy and completeness. A.2 PROBLEM FILTERING AND SOLUTION VERIFICATION To ensure that the solutions collected from official websites and external platforms are accurate, we create an evaluation code judge to validate whether our solution can pass all the test cases from our dataset. The code judge operates differently based on the question type. If a question is removed from a contest, we exclude it from the analysis when comparing model scores against human performance. Batch: For all the batch problems, we run the official code solution against the input-output test cases. The input file is provided to the program, and the code output is verified against the expected output. The subtask scores are computed to verify that the total score adds up to the total points. Any problem for which the solution failed a test case or produced an invalid total score was excluded from further analysis. For problems that accept multiple valid outputs, we set up a testing environment using the grader file supplied in the contest materials and apply the same evaluation procedure, disregarding problems with incorrect solution files. Interactive: If the problem type is interactive, the grader file is executed first to establish the testing environment. Subsequently, the solution file is launched within the environment to exchange input/output streams interactively. After the problem finishes, the grader\u2019s evaluation output is collected to determine whether the solution passed. If the grader doesn\u2019t return a full mark on the ground-truth solution, the corresponding problem is discarded. Output-Only: We exclude output-only problems since they don\u2019t require contestants to submit algorithmic code solutions, making them difficult for evaluating model performance. A.3 METADATA COLLECTION To further enrich and structure our dataset, we augment it with comprehensive problem metadata crawled from solved.ac and Luogu , capturing difficulty ratings and algorithm tags. We then utilize Gemini-2.0-Flash to semantically match problems across different platforms, resolving inconsisten- cies in label formats and taxonomies through a unified mapping strategy. Difficulty Tags: Solved.ac uses integer values from 1 to 30 to represent the difficulty levels, where 1 corresponds to the easiest tier (Bronze V) and 30 corresponds to the hardest tier (Ruby I). However, Luogu employs 7 categorical text labels for its difficulty. To reconcile the inconsistent difficulty scales across platforms, we construct a numerical mapping on a 0 \u221230 scale for Luogu, translating", "levels, where 1 corresponds to the easiest tier (Bronze V) and 30 corresponds to the hardest tier (Ruby I). However, Luogu employs 7 categorical text labels for its difficulty. To reconcile the inconsistent difficulty scales across platforms, we construct a numerical mapping on a 0 \u221230 scale for Luogu, translating 17 Preprint the native difficulty descriptor tags into standardized numerical scores using the mapping as specified in Table A1. The unified scale enables us to assign difficulty scores to all problems by taking the union of both sources. Difficulty Tag Difficulty Score Beginner 5 Easy 9 Intermediate 13 Hard 16 Advanced 18 Expert 21 Master 24 Table A1: Difficulty Tags and Corresponding Scores Algorithm Tags. To ensure data integrity and consistency, we develop a normalization dictionary to standardize dataset labels. This dictionary systematically resolves lexical and semantic variations, including synonyms, related terms, and differences in granularity, by mapping them to a unified set of canonical tags. Missing Tags. In cases where tags were missing, we utilize Gemini-2.0-Flash to infer plausible labels and difficulty from the problem description, enhancing both completeness and labeling quality. To assess the reliability of LLM-inferred difficulty scores, we conduct sampling-based validation on problems with existing difficulty annotations and observe a high degree of consistency with their original scores. Divisions. Finally, we analyze the distribution of algorithm and difficulty tags across the corpus and partition the difficulty range of all contests into four divisions, thereby improving robustness and facilitating downstream contest categorization. The division boundaries are listed in Table A2. Division Min Difficulty Max Difficulty Avg Difficulty Total Contests Division 4 5.0 15.78 13.76 17 Division 3 16.0 20.33 18.05 19 Division 2 20.33 22.33 21.52 19 Division 1 22.5 30.0 23.62 17 Table A2: Division Boundaries by Difficulty Problem Difficulty. We sort all task difficulty scores and split them into three equal-sized buckets by taking the empirical one-third and two-thirds cut points. The problem difficulty distribution is listed in Table A3 Table A3: Problem difficulty distribution using quantile thresholds. Level # Problems % of Total Threshold Rule Easy 143 35.48% d \u226417 Medium 144 35.73% 18 \u2264d \u226422 Hard 116 28.78% d \u226523 Total 403 100% \u2013 A.4 CODEFORCES RATINGS COLLECTION Result Collection: For each contest, the raw human results files are downloaded and restructured. These files typically include contestant identifiers such as usernames, countries, individual task scores, total scores, and medal information. Rating Data Retrieval: Codeforces rating data are obtained by algorithmically mapping contestants\u2019 names to their corresponding profiles in the Codeforces database. Usernames are first normalized by removing diacritics and converting all text to lowercase to enhance matching robustness. Using these normalized usernames together with each contestant\u2019s country, our program submits Google Search queries and inspects the top results to identify potential Codeforces profile URLs. When valid 18 Preprint Codeforces URLs are identified, the extracted handles are queried via the Codeforces API to obtain detailed user profile information, including full name, country, Codeforces ID, and rating history. Database Generation: The retrieved rating histories are parsed to extract Codeforces ratings for each year from 2022 to 2025.", "valid 18 Preprint Codeforces URLs are identified, the extracted handles are queried via the Codeforces API to obtain detailed user profile information, including full name, country, Codeforces ID, and rating history. Database Generation: The retrieved rating histories are parsed to extract Codeforces ratings for each year from 2022 to 2025. When annual data are unavailable, we backfill missing entries by using contestants\u2019 most recent available Codeforces ratings from prior years. For instance, if a contestant participates in 2025 but lacks an updated rating, we use their previous rating when applicable. Contest names and contestant metadata are then appended to a master Codeforces database. If a contestant\u2019s record already exists, only new contest information is added to the existing profile. Rating Matching: After these procedures are applied to every contest results file, a database of Codeforces ratings for all contestants is established. Finally, we link each contestant\u2019s Codeforces rating\u2014matched by name and country\u2014to the corresponding contest year. Model Ratings: To benchmark model performance on our dataset, we calculate a corresponding Codeforces rating for each model on every contest. For each task, we present the full problem statement to the models and prompted them to generate code solutions. Using the provided subtask and test-case data, we compute the total score of each model\u2019s solution. Once total scores were obtained, we derive Codeforces ratings for the models using the CodeElo formula (Quan et al., 2025) given below, where m is the expected rank of a contestant (or model) with rating r, compared to n contestants with known Codeforces ratings r(i). m = n X i=1 1 1 + 10 r\u2212r(i) 400 To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our analysis, we perform several filtering steps on the human data prior to computing Elo ratings. First, we exclude participants who either lack an official Codeforces rating or whose ratings fall below 500. Next, we identify and remove performance outliers by fitting a third-degree polynomial regression to the score-rating data and discarding any results lying more than 2 standard deviations from the fitted curve. Finally, to reduce statistical noise and further enhance data quality, we exclude contests with fewer than 15 valid human Codeforces ratings from the Elo calculation. These steps collectively ensure that our resulting model ratings reliably reflect the true relationship between contestants\u2019 Codeforces ratings and their total contest scores. Table A6 presents all contests for which we successfully matched contestants to their Codeforces profiles, along with the median Codeforces rating for each contest.

The following task, titled Nile, illustrates a typical problem style in our dataset. 22 Preprint Problem: Nile You want to transport N artifacts through the Nile. The artifacts are numbered from 0 to N \u22121. The weight of artifact i (0 \u2264i < N) is W[i]. To transport the artifacts, you use specialized boats. Each boat can carry at most two artifacts. \u2022 If you decide to put a single artifact in a boat, the artifact weight can be arbitrary. \u2022 If you want to put two artifacts in the same boat, you have to make sure the boat is balanced evenly. Specifically, you can send artifacts p and q (0 \u2264p < q < N) in the same boat only if the absolute difference between their weights is at most D, i.e. |W[p] \u2212W[q]| \u2264D. The cost of transporting artifact i (0 \u2264i < N) is: \u2022 A[i], if you put the artifact in its own boat, or \u2022 B[i], if you put it in a boat together with some other artifact. If artifacts p and q are sent together, the total cost is B[p] + B[q]. Since B[i] < A[i] for all i, sending an artifact with another is always cheaper when possible. Unfortunately, the river is unpredictable and the value of D changes often. Your task is to answer Q queries, described by array E of length Q. For query j (0 \u2264j < Q), the answer is the minimum cost of transporting all N artifacts when D = E[j]. Implementation Details std::vector<long long> calculate_costs( std::vector<int> W, std::vector<int> A, std::vector<int> B, std::vector<int> E) \u2022 W, A, B: arrays of length N, describing weights and costs. \u2022 E: array of length Q, values of D. \u2022 Returns: array R with R[j] equal to the minimum cost for D = E[j].

Quantitatively, GPT-5 consistently leads: in its stronger quarters (Q1\u201923, Q4\u201923, Q1\u201925), it consistently outperforms Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-OSS-20B-Medium by about 15\u201325 percentage points, which is in line with Table A9. E.2 INFERENCE-TIME SCALING Inference-time scaling has been shown effective for improving model performance in math (Snell et al., 2024; Brown et al., 2024) and coding (Li et al., 2025a; Ehrlich et al., 2025) domains. We investigate two dimensions: parallel scaling involves sampling multiple diverse solution candidates (Chen et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2024), while sequential scaling generates long chains-of-thought with complex reasoning strategies such as self-reflection and backtracking (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Figure A4: Sequential Scaling plots the pass rate against the reasoning budget (measured in average completion tokens), showing that performance improves with more extensive reasoning, though models exhibit different token efficiencies. Parallel Scaling: GPT-5 demonstrates superior coding capacity boundary. Figure 2 reveals significant differences in coding capacity boundaries (Yue et al., 2025) across models as measured by Pass@k. GPT-5 could pass around 64% of the problems given 8 attempts per problem. The steepest improvements occur between Pass@1 and Pass@4, indicating that the marginal benefit of additional attempts diminishes rapidly as models approach their capacity limits (Kulal et al., 2019). The persistent performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models across all sampling levels suggest fundamental differences in maximum coding capability rather than artifacts of insufficient attempts (Li et al., 2022b; Hendrycks et al., 2021a). 30 Preprint Sequential Scaling: Reasoning models benefit from additional reasoning token budget. Fig- ure A4 shows pass rates improving as token budget increases across all three", "all sampling levels suggest fundamental differences in maximum coding capability rather than artifacts of insufficient attempts (Li et al., 2022b; Hendrycks et al., 2021a). 30 Preprint Sequential Scaling: Reasoning models benefit from additional reasoning token budget. Fig- ure A4 shows pass rates improving as token budget increases across all three models. GPT-OSS-120B achieves the highest performance with the fewest tokens generated. A key insight emerges: smaller models can approach larger model performance with sufficient reasoning budget, suggesting a practi- cal trade-off for resource-constrained practitioners who may prefer specialized smaller models over large ones. Both scaling approaches provide complementary benefits but face efficiency limitations. Sequential scaling shows promise for complex algorithmic problems but requires substantial computational resources, while parallel scaling reveals each model\u2019s performance ceiling as improvements plateau with additional samples (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). Future work could focus on developing hybrid approaches that combine both scaling paradigms while reducing computational overhead. 31 Preprint E.3 REASONING BEHAVIORS ANALYSIS As described in Section 5.2, we partition each reasoning trace into segments of approximately 5k tokens, estimated by dividing the total token length by four. We categorize models\u2019 reasoning traces into eight behaviors, which we group into five broader categories: Analysis (Algorithm/Proof Analysis, Complexity Analysis), Planning (Problem Restatement, Subgoal Setting), Exploration (Backtracking, Dead-end Recognition), Implementation (Pseudo Implementation), and Validation (Test Case Verification).

In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME\u201924 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME\u201925 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME\u201924, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME\u201925 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Ablation studies confirm that both exemplar diversity and scaled sampling schedules are critical drivers of improvement. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Introduction Large language models (LLMs) [RNS+18, AAA+23, TAB+23, Ant25] attain strong deductive and quantitative reasoning once equipped with curated chains of thought (CoT) [WWS+22b] or tool-augmented exemplars [MGH+24]. However, constructing thousand-scale reasoning corpora is costly: it requires prompt engineering, human verification of multi-step solutions, and continuous refresh to track dataset shifts in the wild. Moreover, static large-shot prompts are brittle\u2014fixed exemplars can inadvertently bias the model toward spurious solution templates or fail under domain shift, limiting generalization despite high in-domain scores. Prior work has largely scaled pre-/post-training time data (pre-training, instruction tuning, supervised CoT) or model size, while inference-time strategies typically vary only in decoding parameters (temperature, sampling) or rerank multiple outputs from a single prompt. The combinatorial space of which exemplars to show, how to order them, and how to perturb them remains mostly unexploited. We argue that the prompt itself is a stochastic control knob whose systematic scaling at test time can simulate the effect of large reasoning datasets, without actually collecting them. In this work, we propose Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS) as an LLM data augmen- tation method: given a compact seed pool of just 90 high-quality math reasoning exemplars, we algorithmically expand the prompt space at inference by 1) exemplar subsampling under diversity constraints using various principled instructions [BMS23], 2) ordering perturbations that modulate inductive biases (recency, primacy), and 3) pseudo-sampling of paraphrased rationales and solution skeletons via the model itself. Each seed exemplar question is paired with a prompt ensemble, a set of independently constructed prompt contexts, whose answers are collected. This converts test-time prompting into a scalable augmentation pipeline. Why can 90 beat 1K? The key insight of our framework is that, conventionally, a fixed 1K-shot sample or prompt provides only one (or a few) points in the prompt-combinatorial space, whereas our P-TTS explores a far larger manifold of reasoning cues. From a bias\u2013variance perspective, prompt ensembles for the same question reduce variance in reasoning trajectories and increase coverage of latent solution schemas. Information-theoretically, diverse promptings expose the model to a richer set of conditional priors over intermediate steps, effectively approximating a mixture-of-experts CoT without extra training. Empirically, we find that P-TTS surpasses the gap to 1K-shot baselines across reasoning and zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain tasks, and substantially improves robustness on naturally occurring, shifted test distributions. We verify the effectiveness of P-TTS through two orthogonal dimensions: 1) Semantic/knowl- edge diversity in CoT responses \u2013 measuring how P-TTS expands the coverage of knowledge and concepts. We compare the trade-off between accuracy and knowledge diversity gain across four principled prompting strategies: Reward, Correctness, Penalty, and Think. 2) Language trigram diversity \u2013 quantifying lexical and phrasing variety using distinct n-gram ratios and entropy, applied both to full responses and isolated reasoning traces. Results show that reward framing achieves the greatest lexical diversity, reflecting stronger surface-level variation from the base examples. More broadly, we observe synergistic benefits: semantic/knowledge diversity re- duces overfitting to narrow reasoning templates and enhances transfer; trigram diversity mitigates lexical/template lock-in and strengthens robustness; ordering perturbations counter position bias slightly; and our model-driven", "reward framing achieves the greatest lexical diversity, reflecting stronger surface-level variation from the base examples. More broadly, we observe synergistic benefits: semantic/knowledge diversity re- duces overfitting to narrow reasoning templates and enhances transfer; trigram diversity mitigates lexical/template lock-in and strengthens robustness; ordering perturbations counter position bias slightly; and our model-driven self-augmentation introduces novel but still on-manifold rationales. Finally, scaling curves reveal diminishing returns beyond roughly 6 prompt-augmentations per base question, suggesting this as a practical deployment point. Contributions of this work. (1) We introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling, a simple yet effective framework for LLM inference-time reasoning data augmentation. (2) We demonstrate that only 90 seed samples, when leveraged through our P-TTS, can outperform 1K-shot static Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 2 prompts, reducing curation cost by an order of magnitude. (3) We provide empirical evidence that prompt-space exploration is an underutilized scaling dimension for LLM reasoning. We release code and the augmented exemplar pool to facilitate reproducibility and facilitate rapid transfer to new domains. Collectively, P-TTS reframes test-time prompting from a one-shot design choice into a scalable, stochastic process, unlocking robust reasoning without additional data collection or massive labeled datasets. 2. Related Work LLM Reasoning. The growing availability of frontier autoregressive pretrained large language models that expose long-form rationales (e.g., GPT-o1 [JKL+24], Gemini [TAB+23], Claude 3.7 Sonnet [Ant25], DeepSeek-R1 [GYZ+25]) has integrated RL or SFT pipelines that explicitly incorporate intermediate reasoning. Diffusion LLM [LCGS25, ZGZG25] also shows potential in reasoning capability recently. In many open-sourced reasoning LLM settings [MYS+25, Bes25, GMK+25], a teacher model is usually prompted to produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations for curated inputs, and the resulting (prompt, rationale, answer) triples supervise a student model. For instance, Bespoke-Stratos [Lab25] collects teacher-generated explanations from DeepSeek-R1, while the OpenThinker models [GMK+25] train on the OpenThoughts corpora built with rationales elicited from teachers such as DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B. These methods demonstrate that model-generated reasoning is a scalable supervision signal, but they typically rely on tens to hundreds of thousands of exemplars and substantial collection costs. Our work targets a complementary regime: we exploit instructional wrapping to elicit diverse, high-utility rationales from only 90 seeds, yielding data efficiency competitive with 1K-scale baselines. Inference-Time Scaling. Orthogonal to parameter or dataset scaling [BMR+20, KMH+20], inference-time strategies improve performance without updating model weights. Classic ap- proaches tune decoding hyperparameters (temperature, top-\ud835\udc58, nucleus sampling) to modulate diversity [HBD+19, FLD18, MPWC23], or generate multiple completions from a fixed prompt and aggregate answers, as in few-shot CoT [WWS+22b] and Self-Consistency [WWS+22a]. Recent \u201cthink-more\u201d style methods (e.g., s1/s1.1) adjust the reasoning budget\u2014allocating more deliberate tokens at test time\u2014without altering exemplars or performing additional train- ing [MYS+25]. We build on this line by treating the prompt itself as a first-class scaling axis: P-TTS systematically varies instructional framing to create an ensemble of prompt contexts that can be aggregated at test time or distilled into compact training sets. Data Augmentation for Reasoning Tasks. A complementary line synthesizes new samples or rationales to expand training corpora. MetaMath [YJS+23] bootstraps diverse math problems via generate-and-verify loops, while ReasoningMix [ZCH+25] composes traces by interleaving steps", "of prompt contexts that can be aggregated at test time or distilled into compact training sets. Data Augmentation for Reasoning Tasks. A complementary line synthesizes new samples or rationales to expand training corpora. MetaMath [YJS+23] bootstraps diverse math problems via generate-and-verify loops, while ReasoningMix [ZCH+25] composes traces by interleaving steps across tasks. Such methods operate at the data level by creating novel items or reasoning sequences. In contrast, P-TTS operates at the prompt level: it preserves the original problems but injects controlled diversity through principle-guided wrappers (reward/penalty framing, correctness emphasis, step-by-step cues), which we show can be leveraged both at test time (ensemble prompting) and at training time (SFT over wrapper-elicited rationales). Principled instructions and prompt engineering. General-purpose prompting frameworks catalog instruction patterns that improve reliability and adherence [BMS23]. Our approach instantiates a small subset of such patterns that are directly compatible with math-style reasoning (reward, penalty, correctness, step-by-step) and formalizes them as deterministic wrap operators.

These augmented prompts are used to elicit high- quality LLM completions, which are then collected as synthetic reasoning data to fine-tune. yields a semantically invariant augmentation space with clear ablation handles (template choice, placement, and paraphrase strength). Low-Resource Supervision. Recent efforts show that carefully curated, small datasets can deliver strong reasoning performance. S1 [MYS+25] and LIMO [YHX+25] claim training on \u223c1K high-quality, challenging prompts as a competitive alternative to massive corpora. Our results complement these findings: with only 90 seeds, P-TTS converts principled prompt-space variation into supervision that matches or surpasses 1K-shot baselines, highlighting prompt-level scaling as a practical lever for low-resource regimes. 3. Methodology 3.1. Overview We propose Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a reasoning-centric data augmentation framework that expands a compact seed set via instructional wrapping. Rather than modifying task semantics, P-TTS applies a family of fixed textual wrappers (\u201cprinciples\u201d) [BMS23] to each seed example, producing prompt variants that preserve the original problem while modulating the instructional framing (e.g., reward/penalty", "Scaling (P-TTS), a reasoning-centric data augmentation framework that expands a compact seed set via instructional wrapping. Rather than modifying task semantics, P-TTS applies a family of fixed textual wrappers (\u201cprinciples\u201d) [BMS23] to each seed example, producing prompt variants that preserve the original problem while modulating the instructional framing (e.g., reward/penalty cues, correctness emphasis, or step-wise guidance). Concretely, a principle \ud835\udc5dis realized by a template \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5dthat deterministically wraps the raw question \ud835\udc5e, yielding \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) = \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5d\u2225\ud835\udc5e(string concatenation \u2225). The union of the original prompts and their principle-conditioned variants forms a P-TTS augmented corpus. Unlike large-scale supervision or domain-specific curation, P-TTS relies on principle-guided prompt reformulation to elicit high-quality reasoning traces from a teacher model, which are then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a student. In Sec. 4.3 we show that individual principles already yield measurable gains over the null prompt, and that training on the full P-TTS corpus (from only 90 seeds) can match or exceed models fine-tuned on substantially more data (Table 8). Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 4 3.2. Dataset Seed Selection Strategy We adopt a seed-based construction paradigm [ZAD+25]: a small, vetted set of problems serves as the substrate for systematic instructional variation. Our seeds comprise \ud835\udc41=90 problems from AIME 2022\u20132024, selected for (i) reasoning density across algebra, combinatorics, number theory, geometry, and probability; (ii) format and label reliability (professionally authored items with definitive three-digit answers); and (iii) contamination mitigation\u2014restricting to recent editions reduces overlap with widely scraped, earlier AIME corpora [HYS+25, AAA+23]. This compact, high-quality set enables controlled scaling via instructional wrappers without compromising semantic fidelity. 3.3. Selection of Instructional Principles We instantiate four core principles Pcore = {Reward, Penalty, Correctness, StepByStep}, chosen for their direct applicability to math reasoning and prior evidence of consistent gains across model families [BMS23]. Each principle \ud835\udc5dis bound to a fixed template \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5dand applied as a wrap operator without modifying \ud835\udc5e\u2019s tokens: \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5d\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56. (1) This guarantees semantic invariance: removing the principled template \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5ddeterministically recovers question \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56.

For each \ud835\udc5e(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 the teacher returns a reasoning trace \ud835\udc5f(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 and a full response \ud835\udc66(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 yielding Dseed = n\u0000\ud835\udc5e(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc5f(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u0001o\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1. (4) where \ud835\udc5f(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 is the teacher-generated reasoning trace, \ud835\udc66(\u2205) \ud835\udc56 is the full teacher response, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56is the ground-truth answer, and \ud835\udc41= 90 is the total number of seed problems. Selected/Core principle transformations. As shown in Sec. 3.3 and Table 1, we select four principles as our core set. Each principle \ud835\udc5d\u2208Pcore is implemented as a deterministic operator \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d(\u00b7) that wraps the original text with a fixed instructional template \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5dwhile leaving the tokens of \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56unmodified: \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5d\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56 (string concatenation \u2225). (5) where \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 is the wrapped question under principle \ud835\udc5d, and \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5dis the fixed instructional template. This construction preserves the mathematical content, since removing \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5drecovers the original question \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56. Querying \ud835\udc47with each \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 produces (\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 ), and we collect Dcore = n\u0000\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u0001 \ud835\udc56= 1, . . . , \ud835\udc41; \ud835\udc5d\u2208Pcore o .

Reward framing variants for reward principle. Our single-principle ablation (Sec. 4.3) shows that Reward Framing yields the largest accuracy gain among the core strategies. To test whether this effect depends on exact wording, we create six paraphrased Reward prompts that vary in incentive magnitude, placement, and phrasing strength.1 VReward = {\ud835\udc451, \ud835\udc452, \ud835\udc453, \ud835\udc454, \ud835\udc455, \ud835\udc456}. Applying each Reward variant to all \ud835\udc41problems and querying \ud835\udc47gives : DReward = n\u0000 \u02c6\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc4e\u2217 \ud835\udc56 \u0001 \ud835\udc56= 1, . . . , \ud835\udc41; \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc57\u2208VReward o .

Table 1 summarizes the four core principles, and Table 2 lists the Reward Framing paraphrases in full. Prompt order impact. We also study how the ordering of prompts affects LLM responses and, in turn, their reasoning ability. Specifically, we experiment with placing the additional prompt either before (R1) or after (R4) the original question, as shown in Table 2. In general, positioning prompts at the beginning leads the model to focus more on the prompt\u2019s instructions and therefore achieves better accuracy, as shown in Table 13. Intriguingly, we further notice that when the question is relatively short, the difference in accuracy is actually small. Dataset configurations and scale. We construct four", "positioning prompts at the beginning leads the model to focus more on the prompt\u2019s instructions and therefore achieves better accuracy, as shown in Table 13.

We construct four dataset families from the same \ud835\udc41seeds, distinguishing single\u2013principle sets from their unions: 1Appendix D reports model accuracy across five Reward Framing variants (R1\u2013R5) that differ in reward amount (e.g., $20 vs. $200,000) and location (e.g., beginning vs. end of prompt).

Each variant is generated from the baseline \ud835\udc451 via an operator: \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc57= T\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc451), where I denotes identity. Operator definitions: TCOND : \ud835\udc36(add conditionality); TLOW : \ud835\udc40\u2193 (reduce magnitude in USD); THIGH : \ud835\udc40\u2191(increase magnitude in USD); TSUFFIX : \ud835\udf0b=suffix (change placement); TREASON : \ud835\udf0c\u2260\u2205(add reasoning cue, e.g., step-by-step). (i) Single-P-TTS (per principle). For each \ud835\udc5d\u2208Pcore we build a separate dataset Dsingle (\ud835\udc5d) = \b \u0000\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc5d) \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc4e\u2217 \ud835\udc56 \u0001 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1, Dsingle (\ud835\udc5d) = \ud835\udc41= 90. Thus, there are four Single-P-TTS datasets (one per principle). When we report \u201cSingle\u201d, we train one model per \ud835\udc5d(and report results per \ud835\udc5dor their mean, as specified in Sec. 4.3). (ii) Core-P-TTS (union of singles). The core set is the (disjoint) union over all four principles: Dcore = \u00c4 \ud835\udc5d\u2208Pcore Dsingle (\ud835\udc5d) , |Dcore| = 4\ud835\udc41= 360. (iii) Seed combined with the core P-TTS. We add the null-prompt (seed) Dseed and DReward to obtain Dseed+core = Dseed \u222aDcore, |Dseed+core| = 5\ud835\udc41= 450. (iv) Full P-TTS. Let VReward denote the set of reward paraphrases \ud835\udc3etotal variants applied to all seeds, producing DReward. Because one variant is already used in the Core set, the additional Reward set has size (\ud835\udc3e\u22121)\ud835\udc41. The full corpus is Dfull P-TTS = Dseed \u222aDcore \u222aDReward, |Dfull P-TTS| = (1 + 4 + (\ud835\udc3e\u22121))\ud835\udc41. In our experiments we use \ud835\udc3e=6, so |Dfull P-TTS| = 10\ud835\udc41= 900. We parameterize the corpus size by the augmentation multiplier \ud835\udc5a:= |D|/\ud835\udc41, where D is the training corpus.

Fine-Tuning with P-TTS Dataset Augmentations We evaluate whether principle-guided wrapping improves supervised reasoning under constrained data. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Instruct (7B/14B/32B) [YLY+25] separately on each configuration from Sec. 3.4, following an SFT recipe adapted from s1 [MYS+25]. The student is trained to predict full assistant outputs (reasoning + answer) with token-level cross-entropy computed on assistant tokens only (user tokens masked). Each dataset configuration (Original, Single, Core, Mix, and Full P-TTS) is used to train a separate model, enabling us to isolate the contribution of each prompting strategy and the effect of data scaling, i.e., isolating the impact of instructional diversity and corpus scale (\ud835\udc5a\u2208{1, 4, 5, 10}) while keeping optimization and decoding fixed across runs.

Our dataset scale (90 \u2192900 examples) is intentionally small, allowing us to directly measure how principle-guided prompt reformulations affect supervised reasoning performance relative to models trained on much larger datasets. 4. Experiments 4.1. Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate our P-TTS models on four public reasoning benchmarks: AIME24 [AIM24] (30 problems) and AIME25 [AIM25] (15 problems) from the American Invitational Mathematics Examination; AIME includes problems from algebra, arithmetic, geometry, number theory, com- binatorics, and probability. MATH500 [HBK+21] is a 500-problem competition-math subset; we adopt the publicly released OpenAI selection used in prior work. GPQA-Diamond [RHS+24] contains 198 PhD-level science questions from Biology, Chemistry, and Physics with re- ported expert performance of 69.7%. We evaluate using the lm-evaluation-harness frame- work [GBB+21, BSS+24]. To make results comparable across models and ablations, we disable sampling by setting the temperature to 0 (greedy decoding), so each input yields a deterministic output. Reported scores are accuracy (equivalent to pass@1). In addition to these four core benchmarks, we further assess cross-domain and multilingual generalization using a broader set of reasoning tasks spanning Chinese exams, U.S. school math, olympiad-style problems, and scientific quantitative reasoning. These evaluations, shown in Table 9, include Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench [HLB+24], AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Baselines. We benchmark P-TTS against three categories of reasoning models.

Diversity Metrics. We compute two complementary metrics\u2014semantic and surface\u2013level\u2014to quantify how each single-principle variant in Dcore adds information beyond the seed set (Dseed). Semantic diversity (Diversity Gain). Following [YJS+23, Bil22], we compute diversity gain to quantify knowledge-level novelty. Given a seed dataset Dseed and a new dataset Dcore, we define DG = 1 \ud835\udc40 \u00cd \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u2208Dcore min\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\u2208Dseed \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57) 2 2, where \ud835\udc53(\u00b7) is an embedding function and \ud835\udc40= |Dcore|. We use OpenAI\u2019s text-embedding-ada-002 as \ud835\udc53for feature extraction. Higher values indicate greater semantic divergence from the base data. Surface\u2013level diversity (trigram diversity). We compute trigram diversity [LYH+22], defined as the ratio of non-overlapping trigrams between two texts2. We average this score over all sample pairs between each P\u2013TTS principle variant in Dcore and its corresponding baseline instance in Dseed. x1 \u00d74 \u00d75 \u00d710 Augmentation Multiplier (\u00d7) 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Accuracy (%) Effect of Scaling Principle-Based Augmentation on Model Accuracy GPQA-Diamond AIME24 AIME25 MATH500 Figure 3.

Accuracy improves consistently across all evaluation sets with larger, principle-guided augmentations. 4.2. Teacher Model for Data Construction Our objective is to construct a compact yet high-quality mathematical reasoning corpus for supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we aim to identify the possible smallest training corpus that still yields the highest downstream accuracy. To obtain both full responses and explicit reasoning traces, we consider large language models that expose chain-of-thought generation through their public APIs. We benchmark three reasoning models: Claude-3-Opus, DeepSeek-R1, and OpenAI 2For texts \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, TD(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) = 1 \u2212| Tri(\ud835\udc65)\u2229Tri(\ud835\udc66)| | Tri(\ud835\udc65)\u222aTri(\ud835\udc66)| , where Tri(\ud835\udc65) denotes the set of distinct word-level trigrams in \ud835\udc65.

Claude-3-Opus and DeepSeek-R1 natively return aligned answer\u2013reasoning pairs, while Omni-4 requires an augmented prompt to elicit full reasoning. From each model, we collect 90 answer\u2013reasoning pairs and fine-tuned a Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on the resulting dataset. Table 12 reports accuracy averaged over all four benchmarks. The Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model fine-tuned on DeepSeek-R1 outputs consistently outperforms counterparts trained on Claude and Omni-4 outputs under the same small corpus.

We compare the trade-off between Accuracy (blue solid line, left y-axis) and Knowledge Diversity Gain (gray dashed line, right y-axis) on 7B model for four principled prompting strategies: Reward, Correctness, Penalty, and Think. Diversity Gain is computed relative to the original P-TTS baseline. 4.3. Ablation Studies 4.3.1. Single-P-TTS: Measuring the Impact of Each Principle Single-P-TTS. To assess the impact of each principle independently, we fine-tune separate Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the Single P-TTS subsets\u201490 examples per model\u2014each applying only one core principle \ud835\udc5d\u2208Pcore. We compare these models to a baseline trained on the same seed problem without any instructional framing (P-TTSSeed). As shown in Table 3, all Single P-TTS variants outperform the baseline on average. The Reward-based model (P-TTSReward) yields the highest overall gain (+6.67%), improving accuracy across all benchmarks. Penalty-based model (P-TTSPenalty) also delivers strong results, especially on MATH500, though with a drop Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 10 on AIME25. Correctness-based model (P-TTSCorrectness) offers modest improvements, while Think-based model (P-TTSThink) increases the average but underperforms on MATH500. These findings highlight that even minimal augmentations, i.e., just 90 principle-guided examples, can yield measurable improvements. Among the four principles, Reward and Penalty framings are the most effective when applied independently. Model #Ex. AIME-24 AIME-25 MATH500 GPQA-D Avg.

To further evaluate the usefulness of each principle and whether they can be effectively combined, we explore the case where a principle that is not highly effective on its own might still contribute positively when paired with another. Specifically, since P-TTSReward shows the strongest performance in the Single P-TTS ablation, we fix the Reward framing and incrementally add one additional principle at a time, resulting in datasets of 180 examples. Table 3 shows the performance of each pairwise combination. We observe that combining Reward framing with either Correctness or Penalty significantly boosts performance across most benchmarks, particularly on MATH500 and AIME2024. Also, the P-TTSReward\u222aCorrectness combination achieves the highest overall accuracy (39.02%), suggesting a synergistic effect between reward framing and correctness emphasis. In contrast, combining Reward framing with Thinking yields only modest improvements, indicating diminishing returns when both principles primarily influence the reasoning process. Core-P-TTS. To assess the relative importance of each principle when used in combination, we conduct a leave-one-out ablation over the full Core P-TTS dataset Dcore (360 examples). We fine-tune a separate Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model after removing one principle at a time, reducing the training set to 270 examples. As shown in Table 4, the exclusion of the Reward framing leads to the largest performance drop (from 39.06% to 35.40%), confirming its central role in driving improvements. Removing Correctness or Penalty framing causes moderate degradation, while the absence of Step-by-Step thinking has minimal or slightly positive effects. These results indicate that Reward-based cues are the most impactful when principles are used in combination, whereas Step-by-Step prompting contributes the least in multi-principle settings. Fig. 5 further supports this finding, showing that the incremental addition of principles leads to consistent accuracy improvements. 4.3.2.

Single P-TTS variants with higher semantic diversity (Diversity Gain), such as P-TTSReward and P-TTSPenalty, also exhibit larger accuracy improvements. Table 6 complements this by quantifying surface-level diversity (trigram diversity): P-TTSReward attains the highest scores across both final responses and reasoning traces, consistent with the observed performance gains.

To further understand how each principle influences model behavior, we compare the token lengths of generated responses and reasoning traces in Table 7. We observe that Reward framing consistently produces longer and more detailed reasoning outputs, which aligns with its observed accuracy gains. While longer generations may imply increased inference costs, the improved reasoning quality may justify this tradeoff in high-stakes tasks. Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 13 P-TTS-32B Question If the Sun\u2019s absolute magnitude is +5, find the luminosity of a star of magnitude 0 in ergs/s. A useful constant: the luminosity of the sun is 3.83 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc601033 ergs/s Response Okay, so I need to find the luminosity of a star with magnitude 0, given that the Sun\u2019s absolute magnitude is +5 and its luminosity is 3.83 \u00d7 1033 ergs/s. Hmm, let\u2019s start by recalling the relationship between magnitude and luminosity. First, absolute magnitude ........ given as +5. The star we\u2019re interested in has an absolute magnitude of 0. The difference in magnitude between the two stars is 5 - 0 = 5 magnitudes. In astronomy, the difference in magnitudes relates to the ratio of luminosities. The formula is: m1 - m2 = -2.5 log10 (L1 / L2) ........ indeed m1 - m2 = -2.5 log10 (L1 / L2). So if we know the difference in magnitudes, we can find the ratio of luminosities. In our case, m1 (Sun) is +5, m2 (star) is 0. So m1 - m2 = 5 - 0 = +5. Plugging into the formula: 5 = \u22122.5 log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar) Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I have the formula right. ......... Then L1 is luminosity of Sun, L2 is luminosity of star. So m1 - m2 = 5 - 0 = +5. Therefore: 5 = \u22122.5 log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar) Let me solve for log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar): Divide both sides by -2.5: 5 \u22122.5 = log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar) Which is \u22122 = log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar) Therefore, \ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar = 10\u22122 = 0.01 So \ud835\udc3fstar = \ud835\udc3fsun/0.01 = \ud835\udc3fsun \u00d7 100 Therefore, ........ is 3.83 \u00d7 1033 \u00d7 100 = 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Wait, let me check that calculation again. ......... Yep, same result. Therefore, the answer should be 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Final Answer", "log10(\ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar) Therefore, \ud835\udc3fsun/\ud835\udc3fstar = 10\u22122 = 0.01 So \ud835\udc3fstar = \ud835\udc3fsun/0.01 = \ud835\udc3fsun \u00d7 100 Therefore, ........ is 3.83 \u00d7 1033 \u00d7 100 = 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Wait, let me check that calculation again. ......... Yep, same result. Therefore, the answer should be 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Final Answer 3.83 \u00d7 1035 .... Alternatively, since each 5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 100 in luminosity, a difference of 5 magnitudes (from +5 to 0) means the star is 100 times more luminous than the Sun. So again, 3.83 \u00d7 1033 \u00d7 100 = 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Therefore, the luminosity of the star is 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. Final Answer 3.83 \u00d7 1035 ......... Figure 6. Example of a P-TTS-32B response. See Appendix F for comparison with baseline model outputs. 4.5. Main Results Overall Performance Comparison. We compare our P-TTS-32B model, trained on just 900 principle-augmented examples, against a diverse set of competitive baselines, including closed- source APIs, open-source models, and open-weight instruction-tuned variants of Qwen2.5-32B. While closed models like o1-preview and o1-mini perform strongly on certain tasks, P-TTS- 32B outperforms them on AIME2024 and MATH500, and delivers competitive results on GPQA-Diamond despite using less data. Compared to open-weight models that finetuned on Qwen2.5-instaruct-32B like OpenThinker-32B (114K examples) and Bespoke-32B (17K), our model achieves superior or comparable performance across all benchmarks. P-TTS-32B achieves an average accuracy of 70.35%, exceeding all open-weight instruction-tuned baselines, and narrowing the gap with large-scale models like DeepSeek-R1, which require over 800K training examples.

Cross-Domain and Multilingual Generalization. Although P-TTS is trained only on 90 English AIME-style problems (AIME22\u201324), it exhibits robust zero-shot transfer to benchmarks that differ in language, curriculum, and problem format. In Table 9, we evaluate on Chinese exam datasets (Gaokao, Kaoyan), U.S. competition and school math (OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath), and scientific quantitative reasoning (Minerva). These tasks introduce shifts in linguistic style (Chinese vs. English), assessment design (competition vs. entrance exams vs. textbook problems), and reasoning presentation (concise Olympiad proofs vs. step-by-step classroom narratives). Despite no multilingual supervision and no direct exposure to these benchmarks during finetuning, P-TTS attains competitive accuracy across the board, narrowing the gap with models trained on one to two orders of magnitude more data. This suggests that principled prompt augmentation through varying instructional framing and exemplar structure encourages prompt-space coverage that translates into language and curriculum robustness, elicits knowledge from pre-trained models, rather than overfitting to a single benchmark family. Scaling across model sizes. We evaluate how P-TTS performance scales with model size across the 7B, 14B, and 32B model variants. At every scale, P-TTS outperforms both S1 and S1.1 on most benchmarks, as shown in table 11. For instance, P-TTS-7B surpasses S1.1-7B by +30.0% on Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 15 Benchmark 7B Models 14B Models 32B Models P-TTS S1 S1.1 P-TTS S1.1 P-TTS S1 S1.1 AIME2024 43.33 16.67 13.33 53.33 33.33 73.33 50.00 56.70 AIME2025 26.67 13.33 20.00 26.67 33.33 53.33 26.70 50.00 MATH500 84.20 77.20 81.20 90.40 91.60 94.20 92.60 94.40 GPQA-Diamond 41.92 41.41 41.41 51.01 51.01 60.61 56.60 60.60 Table 10. Accuracy (%) on Four Benchmarks with Grouped Model Sizes. Each group shows results for core M1, S1, and S1.1. AIME2024 and achieves comparable results on MATH500 with fewer examples. At 14B level, P-TTS continues to lead across all tasks, reaching 53.33% on AIME2024 and 90.4% on MATH500. Notably, at the 32B scale, P-TTS achieves 73.33% on AIME2024 and 94.20% on MATH500, outperforming both S1 and S1.1 despite their larger training sizes. These results highlight the robustness and efficiency of principled instruction tuning (P-TTS), demonstrating that even with minimal data (90 \u2192900), it scales effectively and consistently enhances performance across diverse benchmarks. 5. Conclusion We presented Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a lightweight yet effective framework that converts a compact seed set into a high-utility reasoning corpus by wrapping each problem with principled instructional prompts.

Conclusion We presented Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a lightweight yet effective framework that converts a compact seed set into a high-utility reasoning corpus by wrapping each problem with principled instructional prompts. Without changing task semantics, P-TTS systematically explores prompt-space via reward/penalty framing, correctness emphasis, and step-by-step guidance, eliciting high-quality rationales from a teacher model to supervise a student. Across configurations with augmentation multipliers \ud835\udc5a\u2208{1, 4, 5, 10}, P-TTS consistently improves supervised reasoning relative to the null prompt and even starting from only 90 seeds, matches or surpasses models trained on substantially larger, static datasets. P-TTS demonstrates that instructional prompt reformulation is a powerful and overlooked scaling lever. With only 90 carefully chosen seeds, principled wrapping and its paraphrased variants produce supervision that competes with (and at times exceeds) 1K-shot baselines in the wild, substantially lowering the data curation burden for robust LLM reasoning. Future Work. We see several promising directions: (1) adaptive, per-instance selection of instructional wrappers via learned policies; (2) integration with retrieval and verifier/reranker pipelines to couple wrapper diversity with factual grounding; (3) principled scheduling of wrapper mixtures over training epochs to mimic curriculum learning; and (4) systematic study of wrapper transfer across tasks, languages, and modalities. 6. Limitations There are several potential limitations. First, the evaluation is concentrated on math-style problems with single numeric answers (AIME22\u201324), so external validity to open-ended, multimodal, or multilingual reasoning remains to explore further. Second, P-TTS depends on a single family to generate rationales; any bias, error, or stylistic artifact in the teacher can be amplified by our wrappers and propagated to the student, especially since rationales were not human-audited. Third, while wrappers are designed to be semantically invariant, some templates (e.g., extreme reward/penalty framings) may shift reasoning behavior in undesired ways and could introduce ethical or calibration issues; sensitivity to wrapper mixture, placement, and decoding settings also suggests latent hyperparameter fragility. Fourth, despite contamination mitigation, residual leakage from publicly available AIME material cannot be conclusively ruled out. Finally, P-TTS Technical Report | October 13, 2025 | 16 requires compute at data collection through inference generation (via wrapper ensembles). References AAA+23.

Training Details We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Instruct family at three scales\u20147B, 14B, and 32B\u2014using our P-TTS datasets. All models were trained for 5 epochs with an effective global batch size of 16 (micro-batch size of 1 with gradient accumulation). We used the AdamW optimizer (\ud835\udefd1 = 0.9, \ud835\udefd2 = 0.95, weight decay = 1 \u00d7 10\u22124) and a base learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125, warmed up linearly for the first 5% of steps and decayed to zero following a cosine schedule. Training was conducted in bfloat16 precision with fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) enabled. We set the maximum sequence length to 20k tokens to avoid truncation of reasoning traces. For supervision, loss was applied only to the reasoning and answer tokens, not the input question text. Across model scales, this consistent setup allowed us to directly compare how principled data augmentation transfers to different parameter sizes. 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 Training Steps 0.422 0.488 0.555 0.622 0.689 0.756 0.823 0.890 Loss Training Loss Original Reward Correctness Penalty Step-by-Step Original Final (0.607) 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 Training Steps 0.32 1.58 2.85 4.12 5.38 6.65 Grad Norm Gradient Norm Original Reward Correctness Penalty Step-by-Step 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 Training Steps 10 6 10 5 Learning Rate Learning Rate Schedule Original Reward Correctness Penalty Step-by-Step Figure 7.

Example from Dfull-P-TTS Original Question Let \ud835\udc42= (0, 0), \ud835\udc34= \u0010 1 2, 0 \u0011 , and \ud835\udc35= \u0010 0, \u221a 3 2 \u0011 be points in the coordinate plane. Let F be the family of segments \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc44of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \ud835\udc43on the \ud835\udc65-axis and \ud835\udc44on the \ud835\udc66-axis. There is a unique point \ud835\udc36on \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35, distinct from \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35, that does not belong to any segment from F other than \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35. Then \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc362 = \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5e, where \ud835\udc5dand \ud835\udc5eare relatively prime positive integers. Find \ud835\udc5d+ \ud835\udc5e. Response Given points \ud835\udc42= (0, 0), \ud835\udc34= \u0010 1 2, 0 \u0011 , and \ud835\udc35= \u0010 0, \u221a 3 2 \u0011 , we need to find the unique point \ud835\udc36on \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35that does not belong to any segment from the family F other than \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35. The family F consists of segments \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc44of unit length with \ud835\udc43on the \ud835\udc65-axis and \ud835\udc44 on the \ud835\udc66-axis. Each segment in F can be parametrized as \ud835\udc65/cos(\ud835\udf03) + \ud835\udc66/sin(\ud835\udf03) = 1 where \ud835\udf03is an angle parameter. The segment \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35itself corresponds to \ud835\udf03= \ud835\udf0b/3. To find the point \ud835\udc36, we parametrize \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35as \ud835\udc65= 1\u2212\ud835\udc61 2 and \ud835\udc66= \u221a 3\ud835\udc61 2 for \ud835\udc61\u2208[0, 1]. Substituting these coordinates into the equation of the line segment from F , we derive the condition for \ud835\udc36to lie only on \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35. By solving the resulting equations and ensuring that the derivative condition (to check for a double root) is satisfied, we find that \ud835\udc61= 3 4. This gives the coordinates of \ud835\udc36as \u0010 1 8, 3 \u221a 3 8 \u0011 . Calculating \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc362: \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc362 = \u00121 8 \u00132 + 3 \u221a 3 8 !2 = 1 64 + 27 64 = 28 64 = 7 16 Thus, \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc362 = 7 16 where \ud835\udc5d= 7 and \ud835\udc5e= 16. Therefore, \ud835\udc5d+ \ud835\udc5e= 7 + 16 = 23. 23 Reasoning Trace Okay, so I need to find the square of the distance from the origin O to this special point C on segment AB. The problem says that C is the unique point on AB, other than A and B, that isn\u2019t on any other segment from the family .... Figure 8. Example of an original AIME-style math problem, along with its model-generated response and reasoning trace.

Let \ud835\udc42= (0, 0), \ud835\udc34= \u0010 1 2, 0 \u0011 , and \ud835\udc35= \u0010 0, \u221a 3 2 \u0011 be points in the coordinate plane. Let F be the family of segments \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc44 of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \ud835\udc43on the \ud835\udc65-axis and \ud835\udc44on the \ud835\udc66-axis.

P-TTS-32B vs. S1-32B Question : If the Sun's absolute magnitude is +5, find the luminosity of a star of magnitude 0 in ergs/s. A useful constant: the luminosity of the sun is 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 ergs/s P-TTS-32B S1-32B Okay, so I need to find the luminosity of a star with magnitude 0, given that the Sun's absolute magnitude is +5 and its luminosity is 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 ergs/s. Hmm, let's start by recalling the relationship between magnitude and luminosity. First, absolute magnitude is a measure of a star's intrinsic brightness, as it would be seen from a standard distance. The Sun's absolute magnitude is given as +5. The star we're interested in has an absolute magnitude of 0. The difference in magnitude between the two stars is 5 - 0 = 5 magnitudes. In astronomy, the difference in magnitudes relates to the ratio of luminosities. The formula is: m1 \u2212 m2 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L1/L2) Where m1 and m2 are the magnitudes, and L1 and L2 are the corresponding luminosities. Wait, but here we have absolute magnitudes,", "stars is 5 - 0 = 5 magnitudes. In astronomy, the difference in magnitudes relates to the ratio of luminosities. The formula is: m1 \u2212 m2 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L1/L2) Where m1 and m2 are the magnitudes, and L1 and L2 are the corresponding luminosities. Wait, but here we have absolute magnitudes, so this formula should apply. Let me confirm. Yes, the formula for the difference in magnitudes is indeed m1 \u2212 m2 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L1/L2). So if we know the difference in magnitudes, we can find the ratio of luminosities. In our case, m1 (Sun) is +5, m2 (star) is 0. So m1 \u2212 m2 = 5 \u2212 0 = +5. Plugging into the formula: 5 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I have the formula right. The formula is m1 \u2212 m2 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L1/L2). So if m1 is the magnitude of the first star (Sun), m2 is the magnitude of the second star (star of interest). Then L1 is luminosity of Sun, L2 is luminosity of star. So m1 \u2212 m2 = 5 \u2212 0 = +5. Therefore: 5 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Let me solve for log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star): Divide both sides by \u22122.5: 5 / (\u22122.5) = log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Which is \u22122 = log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Therefore, L_sun/L_star = 10\u207b\u00b2 = 0.01 So L_star = L_sun / 0.01 = L_sun \u00d7 100 Therefore, the luminosity of the star is 100 times that of the Sun. Given that the Sun's luminosity is 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 ergs/s, then the star's luminosity is 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 \u00d7 100 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u2075 ergs/s. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 multiplied by 100 is indeed 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u2075. Yes. But let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the magnitude difference: Sun's absolute magnitude is +5, star's is 0, so difference is +5. Using the formula m1 \u2212 m2 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L1/L2) Plugging in: 5 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Divide both sides by \u22122.5: 5 / (\u22122.5) = \u22122 = log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L_star) Therefore, L_sun/L_star = 10\u207b\u00b2 = 0.01 Thus, L_star = L_sun / 0.01 = L_sun \u00d7 100 Therefore, 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 \u00d7 100 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u2075 ergs/s. That seems correct. So the luminosity of the star is 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u2075 ergs/s. But let me check if there's another way to approach this to confirm. ... think The problem asks for the luminosity of a star with a given apparent magnitude, given the absolute magnitude of the Sun and the Sun's luminosity. We are given: Sun's absolute magnitude, M_sun = +5 Magnitude of the star, m = 0 Luminosity of the Sun, L_sun = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 ergs/s We need to find the luminosity of the star, L_star. The relationship between absolute magnitude and luminosity is given by: M = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L/L\u2080) where M is the absolute magnitude, L is the luminosity, and L\u2080 is a reference luminosity. For the Sun, we have: M_sun = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L\u2080) 5 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) We can solve this equation for L\u2080: 5/(\u22122.5) = log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) \u22122 = log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) 10\u207b\u00b2 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080 0.01 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080 L\u2080 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / 0.01 L\u2080 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 \u00d7 100 L\u2080", "the Sun, we have: M_sun = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_sun/L\u2080) 5 = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) We can solve this equation for L\u2080: 5/(\u22122.5) = log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) \u22122 = log\u2081\u2080(3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080) 10\u207b\u00b2 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080 0.01 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / L\u2080 L\u2080 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 / 0.01 L\u2080 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u00b3 \u00d7 100 L\u2080 = 3.83\u00d710\u00b3\u2075 ergs/s Now, we need to find the luminosity of the star. The apparent magnitude m is related to the absolute magnitude M by the distance modulus: m \u2212 M = 5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(d) \u2212 5 where d is the distance to the star in parsecs. The absolute magnitude of the star can be found using the same formula as for the Sun: M_star = \u22122.5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(L_star/L\u2080) We are given the apparent magnitude of the star, m = 0. We need to find the absolute magnitude of the star. We can use the fact that the apparent magnitude of the Sun is about \u221226.74. Let's use the relationship between apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and distance. For the Sun, which is at a distance of approximately 1 astronomical unit (AU), we have: m_sun \u2212 M_sun = 5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(d_sun) \u2212 5 The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 1.496\u00d710\u00b9\u00b3 cm. 1 parsec = 3.086\u00d710\u00b9\u2078 cm. d_sun in parsecs = (1.496\u00d710\u00b9\u00b3)/(3.086\u00d710\u00b9\u2078) \u2248 4.85\u00d710\u207b\u2076 parsecs. Using the apparent magnitude of the Sun, m_sun \u2248 \u221226.74: \u221226.74 \u2212 5 = 5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(4.85\u00d710\u207b\u2076) \u2212 5 \u221231.74 = 5\u00b7(log\u2081\u2080(4.85) + log\u2081\u2080(10\u207b\u2076)) \u2212 5 \u221231.74 = 5\u00b7(log\u2081\u2080(4.85) \u2212 6) \u2212 5 \u221231.74 = 5\u00b7log\u2081\u2080(4.85) \u2212 30 \u2212 5 \u221231.74 = 5\u00d70.6856 \u2212 35 \u221231.74 = 3.428 \u2212 35 \u221231.74 = \u221231.572 This is close enough considering the approximations used. Now, let's consider the star with magnitude 0. We need to find its absolute magnitude. We can use the Sun as a reference. ... Figure 9.

We need to find the inradius of triangle \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36. Key steps: 1. **Understanding the Con- figuration**: The circles are arranged in a chain, sequentially tangent, with two cir- cles tangent to \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35and \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36. This implies a relationship between the number of cir- cles, their radii, and the angle at vertex \ud835\udc35. 2. **Angle Bisector and Inradius**: The inradius \ud835\udc45of the triangle is related to the distance from the incenter to the sides. The chain of circles forms a path along the angle bisector of \u2220\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36. 3. **Re- lating Configurations**: The product of the number of circles", "the angle at vertex \ud835\udc35. 2. **Angle Bisector and Inradius**: The inradius \ud835\udc45of the triangle is related to the distance from the incenter to the sides. The chain of circles forms a path along the angle bisector of \u2220\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36. 3. **Re- lating Configurations**: The product of the number of circles and their radii for both configurations must be proportional to the inradius. The key insight is that the ratio of the number of circles (253) and the inverse ratio of the radii (34) gives the inradius. 4. **Calculating the Inradius**: The inradius \ud835\udc45is found by recognizing the proportional relationship between the two configurations. The ratio of the number of circles (2024/8 = 253) and the ratio of the radii (34/1 = 34) leads to the inradius being 253 34 . Thus, the inradius \ud835\udc45is 253 34 , and the sum of the numerator and denominator is 253 + Reward Framing Response: Given triangle \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36with sides \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35and \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36, we have two configurations of circles: eight circles of radius 34 and 2024 circles of radius 1, each sequentially tangent and tangent to \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35and \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36respec- tively. We need to find the inradius of triangle \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36. 1. Key Relationship: - The inradius \ud835\udc45of triangle \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36can be related to the radius \ud835\udc5fand the number of circles \ud835\udc41through the angle \ud835\udf03at vertex \ud835\udc35. - The formula derived is: \ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc5f+ 2\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc41\u22121) sin(\ud835\udf03/2). 2.

Equating the Expressions: - Equate the two expressions for \ud835\udc45: 34 + 476 sin(\ud835\udf03/2) = 1 + 4046 sin(\ud835\udf03/2) .... 4. Calculating the Inradius: - Substitute sin(\ud835\udf03/2) = 11 1190 back into the equation for \ud835\udc45using the smaller radius configuration: \ud835\udc45= 1 + 4046 \u00b7 11 1190 - Simplify the calculation: .... 5. Final Result: - The inradius \ud835\udc45is 192 5 , where \ud835\udc5a= 192 and \ud835\udc5b= 5.

The problem is about a triangle ABC with sides AB and BC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent, and two of these circles are tangent to AB and BC respectively. Similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. We need to find the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n. ... However, this is a guess based on the ratio. The problem likely involves this ratio, leading to the answer 287. **Final Answer** 287 Reasoning Trace: Alright, let me try to wrap my head around this problem. So, we have triangle ABC with sides AB and BC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent, meaning each one is tangent to the next, and the first and last ones are tangent to AB and BC respectively. Similarly, we can arrange 2024 circles of radius 1 in the same", "ABC with sides AB and BC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent, meaning each one is tangent to the next, and the first and last ones are tangent to AB and BC respectively. Similarly, we can arrange 2024 circles of radius 1 in the same manner. The question is asking for the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we need to find m + n. ... So, 22,253 / 595 = 37 + 2/5 = 37.4 Therefore, R = 1 + 37.4 = 38.4 = 192/5. Thus, the inradius is 192/5, so m=192, n=5, m + n=197. This seems to check out, and the steps make sense.

Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor per- formance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redun- dant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model de- signed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During in- ference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text to- kens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effec- tively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment be- tween frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances gen- eral VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96. 1 INTRODUCTION VLMs could power autonomous driving, embodied agents, and real-time assistants, but they face critical challenges: understanding near-infinite video, responding in real time stably. To accept infi- nite input, common ideas are Sliding Window Attention with or without overlapping. As shown in Figure 1: (a) Full Attention suffers from heavy memory and latency; (b) Sliding Window (w/o Over- lapping) resets context frequently and breaks coherence; (c) Sliding Window Attention (w/ Overlap- ping) keeps recent tokens but recomputes attention many times, which hurts efficiency. Aligning training with inference adds further challenges. Real streaming requires taking infinite visual input in real time and replying with very low delay, but training cannot use extremely long videos. Current approaches to KV cache eviction often lack alignment with the training phase. How to train on short videos and still enable the model to reason over very long streams remains underexplored. This leads to our core question: How can we train VLMs to understand video chunks in real time and reason stably over infinite video, moving toward human-like intelligence? In this paper, we propose StreamingVLM, a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference and a dataset curation pipeline. The key ideas are: (1) Train the VLM with full attention on short, overlapped video chunks. (2) At inference, use an attention sink and a sliding window with to handle infinite video, aligned with training. (3) Reuse past KV states and use contiguous position IDs", "and a dataset curation pipeline. The key ideas are: (1) Train the VLM with full attention on short, overlapped video chunks.

Using this framework, we build Inf-Streams-Train, a sports commentary SFT dataset of over 4000 hours and Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. Then, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B-Instruct for real-time commentary, yielding StreamingVLM that can understand infinite video and response in real time. We evaluate StreamingVLM on captioning and VQA tasks, including LiveCC-Sports- 3K CC and Inf-Streams-Eval for captioning, and LongVideoBench (and related VQA benchmarks) for video understanding (Chen et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2025a). On captioning tasks, StreamingVLM, with its infinite video understanding, outperforms existing models such as Livecc-7B-Instruct. As shown in Figure 2, StreamingVLM performs well on practi- cal tasks: it can provide continuous commentary for more than two hours on sports games. On VQA tasks, even without any VQA fine-tuning, StreamingVLM still improves on LongVideoBench by +4.30. In terms of efficiency, StreamingVLM maintains a low and stable latency, making it highly suitable for real-world streaming understanding tasks.

(2) With full attention, the context exceeds the training length after processing 2\u20135 minutes of video and latency becomes prohibitive. (3) With a sliding window, models cannot re- tain enough context to benefit from efficiency. In contrast, StreamingVLM addresses these issues, enabling coherent commentary, real-time generation, and long-term history. 2 METHOD In this section, we introduce our method for the model and the data. This part has three components: (1) inference scheme for vision\u2013language processing that supports low-latency updates on infinite video used by StreamingVLM; (2) a training strategy that equips StreamingVLM with streaming inference capability; and (3) the data curation pipelines that provides long-horizon, real-time data for training and a new benchmark, Inf-Streams. 2 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Attention Sink Previous Text Vision Token Current Text Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 0 1 2 \u2026 RoPE Index Evicted Token 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Figure 3: Inference scheme of StreamingVLM. We keep 512 attention-sink tokens to stabilize attention, a long text window of 512 recent tokens to preserve long-term memory, and a short vision window covering 16 seconds to track ongoing actions. We use Contiguous RoPE: indices are shifted to stay within a fixed range, keeping positions in-distribution and within the training length. 2.1 INFERENCE SCHEME OF STREAMINGVLM This section describes the StreamingVLM inference structure shown in Figure 3. These design choices reduce the computation in Figure 1(c) while maintaining comparable performance. Streaming-aware KV Cache The key idea is to maintain a compact and stable KV cache by reusing previous states during streaming inference. As new video frames arrive, we reuse the states of (i) a set of sink text tokens \u2014 including the system and previous text \u2014 of length Tsink; (ii) a long window of the most recent text tokens of length Twindow; and (iii) a short window of the most recent vision tokens of length Vwindow. In Figure 3, the cache lengths are Tsink = 1, Twindow = 3, and Vwindow = 4. With this structure, older vision tokens are evicted first; early text", "the most recent text tokens of length Twindow; and (iii) a short window of the most recent vision tokens of length Vwindow. In Figure 3, the cache lengths are Tsink = 1, Twindow = 3, and Vwindow = 4. With this structure, older vision tokens are evicted first; early text is evicted only when the budget is exceeded. Instead of recomputing previous tokens, this asymmetric retention keep the lowest com- putation while maintaining sufficient context for coherent generation over time, yielding comparable performance with Sliding Window with Overlapping (Figure 1(c)). Contiguous RoPE To prevent positional drift after eviction, we apply contiguous rotary positional embeddings (RoPE). When earlier tokens are removed, the RoPE indices of subsequent and incom- ing tokens are shifted so that their positions remain numerically contiguous with the last retained token. Once the video length surpasses the total window size, the effective RoPE indices stop grow- ing and remain within a bounded range. This keeps positional values in-distribution and stabilizes long-horizon streaming inference. When applied to the Qwen-VL family, which uses 3D positional embeddings for visual tokens, we use contiguous 3D RoPE. The RoPE index is still left-shifted to stay contiguous; for vision tokens, we build 3D indices (time, height, width) and assemble them by the 3D rule, matching the interleaved vision\u2013text layout. 2.2 TRAINING STRATEGY To endow the model with the ability to follow the streaming inference pattern in Figure 3 while keeping training simple, we adopt an overlapped-chunk, full-attention strategy (see Figure 4). The left panel of Figure 4 illustrates the attention at inference time. In this Figure 4, the cache lengths are the same to Figure 3, with Tsink=1, Twindow=3, and Vwindow=4. During training (middle panel of Figure 4), rather than replicating the exact sliding-window schedule used at inference, we split a long video stream into consecutive chunks {C1, C2, . . .} of length W frames, with temporal overlap O frames between Ci and Ci+1 (0 < O < W). Each chunk is treated as a training instance in which vision and text tokens (V/T) are sampled and interleaved at 1 s intervals. We apply full attention within a chunk, i.e., every token may attend to all tokens inside the same chunk. As highlighted in the right panel of Figure 4, this overlapped full-attention supervision closely ap- proximates the effective attention pattern at inference \u2014 attention sink, a longer window of recent text, and a shorter window of recent vision retained in the compact KV cache. Aligning training 3 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams supervision with the test-time context teaches the model the intended recency bias and yields stable streaming behavior without training on prohibitively long, quadratic-cost contexts. 1 2 3 4 Inference Attention Map SFT Attention Map Figure 4: Training Strategy.

Stephen Curry pulls up! Min Words Filtering Stephen Curry pulls up! SFT & Eval Data HQ Annealing Data GPT Filtering Figure 5: Data Curation Pipeline. We collect games from five sports\u2014basketball, soccer, Ameri- can football, ice hockey, and baseball. We use GPT to edit or reject low-quality segments, yielding 2,449 full games. We then build two datasets through separate pipelines: an SFT dataset using overlapped chunking, and a high-quality annealing dataset focused on real-time actions. 2.3.1 VIDEO COLLECTION AND ASR As shown in Figure 5, we collected game videos from five sports: basketball, soccer, ice hockey, baseball, and American football, including 712 basketball games, 544 soccer games, 402 ice hockey games, 399 baseball games, and 392 American football games. The commentary language is En- glish. To ensure video quality and read speed, we constrained the video resolution to 360P\u2013720P with a frame rate of 24 FPS. First, we used the WhisperX model to extract real-time speech (ASR) from these games, obtaining an initial corpus of videos with a total duration of over 6,000 hours and their corresponding real-time commentary. 2.3.2 DATA CLEANING In complete commentary videos, there are often many useless segments, such as advertisements and host monologues. These segments have weak connections between visual content and ASR semantics, making it impossible for the model to infer content from the footage. In addition, the ASR model sometimes fails to correctly recognize details such as player names and team names. Therefore, we set rules and used GPT to clean these data. We first split a game into 120-second segments and concatenate the commentary within each segment, then split it into sentences. Using the segment and the video title (including game time and both teams) as context, we ask the GPT- 5 model to make a decision according to the rules, with options \u201ckeep,\u201d \u201cdelete,\u201d and \u201cedit\u201d each sentence in one chunk. \u201cKeep\u201d means the content is game commentary and is correct. \u201cEdit\u201d means it is commentary but needs to modify some details, such as incorrect names, and the corrected complete sentence is returned. \u201cDelete\u201d means non-compliant content that should not appear in the training data. For kept sentences,", "in one chunk. \u201cKeep\u201d means the content is game commentary and is correct. \u201cEdit\u201d means it is commentary but needs to modify some details, such as incorrect names, and the corrected complete sentence is returned. \u201cDelete\u201d means non-compliant content that should not appear in the training data. For kept sentences, the timestamps are consistent with the ASR results; for edited sentences, we evenly distribute the original sentence duration over each word of the edited sentence (since a sen- tence typically lasts about 3\u20135 seconds, the error is within a tolerable range). In the original ASR data, 46.32% were kept, 37.89% were edited, and 15.79% were deleted, ultimately forming the raw video-commentary pairs of our data. 4 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams 2.3.3 SFT AND EVALUATION DATA SEGMENTATION For the train and validation sets, we build the data as follows. Under the training setup in Section 2.2, we split videos with W = 24 s and O = 12 s. To ensure enough commentary labels per sample, we require at least 2\u2217W words as min words filtering. All commentary before the segment is treated as previous text. During training, we take the first Tsink tokens and the last Twindow tokens from this previous text to match the inference setup. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark, Inf-Streams-Eval. It contains 20 full games with an average length of 2.12 hours. We split each game into 100 s segments, selecting those with at least 200 words. Commentaries of these segments are considered as ground truth. For scoring, a larger model (we use gpt-5) votes between two model outputs with access to ground-truth references. The model with more votes (higher win rate) is judged to provide better commentary. Inf-Streams-Eval has two settings: chunk and infinite, denoted by \u2020 and \u221e, respectively in following tables. In Figure 1, the chunk mode is panel (b), and the infinite mode is panel (d). For models that cannot do infinite inference, we cut the video into chunks; the model receives the previous text and the current chunk to produce a caption. For models that support infinite inference, the model runs on the full stream; we keep its past outputs as previous text and continue captioning until the video ends. 2.3.4 HIGH-QUALITY ANNEALING DATA The above dataset can sft the model\u2019s ability for real-time video understanding. However, it contains a lot of content such as team information and season history; for the human experience of the com- mentary task, we prefer the model to provide real-time commentary on on-field events. Therefore, we created a high-quality annealing data. We first slice all data without overlap, requiring each clip to be 16\u201364 seconds long with internal silence no longer than 3 seconds; each clip must also contain at least 2 \u2217D (duration in seconds) words. Across all games, we obtained 52,530 new samples. Then, we define the standard of \u201creal- time commentary.\u201d For each sample, we use GPT-5 to determine whether the proportion of \u201creal- time commentary\u201d exceeds 80% to decide whether to keep it. In the end, only 14,786 samples", "(duration in seconds) words. Across all games, we obtained 52,530 new samples. Then, we define the standard of \u201creal- time commentary.\u201d For each sample, we use GPT-5 to determine whether the proportion of \u201creal- time commentary\u201d exceeds 80% to decide whether to keep it. In the end, only 14,786 samples were retained. Subsequent experiments in Table 6 show that after applying this portion of data for sft, the model\u2019s capability and commentary quality further improved. 3 EXPERIMENTS In this section, we first describe the implementation details, then evaluate on video captioning and VQA against strong baselines. We next test the efficiency of StreamingVLM. Finally, we run abla- tions to better understand its behavior. 3.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Training We fine-tune StreamingVLM from Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-7B (Bai et al., 2025). Step 1 teaches the model the infinite streaming inference pattern. We train on our SFT set (525K streaming samples) and on LiveCC\u2019s Live-WhisperX-526K (526K streaming samples) (Chen et al., 2025a). Step 2 uses our high-quality annealing data (14K streaming samples, each 16\u201364 s with detailed actions) to boost real-time action commentary and improve human experience. After these two stages, we obtain StreamingVLM. The total compute is about 128 H100-days. Baselines We select strong baselines to compare with StreamingVLM. For the captioning task, we use GPT-4o mini to show commentary strength, and Livecc-7B-Instruct, which is trained on 5.5M YouTube video clips (30 \u2013 240 s) and 178K Video-Question-Answer samples, working well on short videos commentary (OpenAI, 2024; Chen et al., 2025a). We also include ReKV, a strong training- free streaming-inference method (Di et al., 2025). Due to design limits, GPT-4o mini is evaluated on Inf-Streams-Eval in the chunk setting, not the infinite mode used by StreamingVLM. LiveCC- 7B-Instruct is tested in both chunked and infinite settings. For the VQA task, we use Qwen2.5-VL- 7B-Instruct, which is the base model before SFT for StreamingVLM, to show that our SFT pipeline improves the base ability (Bai et al., 2025). 5 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams Table 1: Captioning accuracy (win rate vs. baselines). Base- lines with/without chunking fall short; StreamingVLM surpasses strong models such as GPT-4o and produces compelling commen- tary.(Superscripts for Inf-Streams-Eval: \u221e= infinite; \u2020 = chunk length 100s.

For video understanding, we evaluate StreamingVLM on four public suites.

We observe a paradox for training-free ReKV: models without task-specific fine-tuning perform poorly, yet models that are spe- cially fine-tuned (e.g., StreamingVLM) rely on a fixed context format that ReKV\u2019s eviction policy disrupts, often yielding no output. In contrast, StreamingVLM \u2019s training\u2013inference consistent de- sign resolves this issue. Then, we evaluate StreamingVLM, Qwen-2.5-VL- 7B-Instruct, and LiveCC-7B-Instruct on LiveCC- 3K-Sports-CC and Inf-Streams-Eval. As shown in Table 1, on Inf-Streams-Eval, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B- Instruct cannot keep continuous commentary and thus performs poorly. LiveCC-7B-Instruct works better with chunked inference. Figure 6 further shows that short chunks break coherence; these de- signs do not support infinite inference, and with long chunks they soon exceed the training length and degrade. In contrast, StreamingVLM runs in infinite mode; its long-term memory and streaming video percep- tion give it a clear edge, surpassing GPT-4o mini in commentary quality. Figure 2 (the figure shown) illustrates a real case where StreamingVLM maintains coherent output, real-time latency, and long- term memory, addressing the core challenge of real-time perception for infinite video streams. On LiveCC-3K-Sports-CC, StreamingVLM also performs better than baselines, showing stable stream- ing captioning on videos of various length. 3.2.2 VQA We evaluate StreamingVLM and its base model, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, on four VQA tasks. As shown in Table 3, even without any VQA SFT, StreamingVLM outperforms the base on all tasks, 6 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams Table 3: VQA results comparing StreamingVLM with its base model.

OVOBench Realtime tests understanding of the immediate, streaming scene. On this streaming perception task, StreamingVLM improves by 5.96%. This highlights the strength of Inf-Streams-Train and our training strategy, which enhances the model\u2019s core abilities. 3.3 EFFICIENCY TESTS As shown in Figure 7, we report per-token latency for the three methods in Figure 1 on infinite commentary: VLMs with full attention, sliding window attention (w/o overlapping), sliding window attention (w/ overlapping), and the inference strategy of StreamingVLM, respectively correspond to panels (a), (b), (c), and (d) in the Figure 1. Real-time replies require latency below a fixed threshold as the dashed line. Full attention soon exceed the limit and OOM. Sliding window (w/o overlapping) needs large chunks for coherence, so it shows a periodic latency pattern: at the start of each chunk the model rebuilds context and the commentary is not coherent with the past; later in the chunk, latency rises sharply and fails to meet real-time needs. Sliding window (w/ overlapping) remains inefficient for computation redundancy. StreamingVLM keeps fixed context length and reuses KV, maintains lower and stable latency, and supports real-time commentary at 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. 3.4 ABLATION STUDY 3.4.1 CONTIGUOUS ROPE We study the effect of contiguous RoPE indices. Since we train with full attention, training only uses the native RoPE. At inference, we compare contiguous RoPE with the native version. As shown in Table 4, native RoPE degrades sharply on infinite streams because its index grows fast and exceeds the training range. Splitting the video into 100 s chunks can partly recover accuracy, but it harms long-term conherence. With contiguous RoPE, the position index stays bounded, so the model supports infinite inference without loss. 7 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams Table 5: Ablation of sliding window and sink size with accuracy on captioning tasks (win rate).

Then we search for the best inference settings of Tsink, Twindow, Vwindow. First, the left table in Table 5 ablates the lengths of the attention sink and text window. Here Tsink and Twindow are the lengths of previous attention sink and text window kept during both training and inference. We take a basketball-only subset of the SFT data and train two models: one with text eviction using Tsink=512 and Twindow=512, and one without eviction. On the Inf-Streams-Eval (basketball subset), we evaluate each model under its matching policy (evict vs. no-evict). The left table in table 5 shows that, for infinite inference, evicting previous text tokens is important and improves performance. Next, we study different choices of Vwindow. The right table in Table 5 shows that a 16 s visual window is a good choice: it is long enough to cover recent actions, yet short enough to stay efficient. In contrast, keeping 0 s of vision context leads to a clear drop, confirming that retaining recent vision tokens for continuous actions is essential. 3.4.3 TRAINING STRATEGY AND DATASET We study the effect of our SFT data and high-quality annealing data. The SFT set teaches the model the infinite streaming inference pattern, while the high-quality annealing data further improves com- mentary quality.

Compared with a model trained only on Live-WhisperX-526K, training on the overlapped SFT data strengthens perception of infinite video, yielding clear gains +31.29 (win rate against GPT-4o-mini) on Inf- Streams-Eval and +3.68 (win rate against LLaVA-Video-72B-Qwen2) on Livecc-Sports-3K cc. High-quality Annealing Data Our high-quality annealing data focus on real-time content and fur- ther boosts model ability. As shown in Table 6, we compare training with and without the high- quality annealing data. We can observe significant gains on both captioning and VQA benchmarks. 8 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams 4 RELATED WORK Vision\u2013Language Models Early multimodal models start from images and then extend to videos by adding temporal modules or token schedulers. Recent open models improve video understanding and transfer across tasks. Examples include LLaVA-OneVision for unified transfer across images, multi-image inputs, and videos (Li et al., 2024a), Video-LLaMA 2 for spatial\u2013temporal and audio cues (Cheng et al., 2024), InternVideo2/2.5 for scaling video encoders and long context (Wang et al., 2024; 2025b), LongVILA for long video training system (Chen et al., 2025b), and Qwen2.5-VL for strong grounding, document parsing, and long-video skills (Bai et al., 2025). Most systems process finite clips and often place all vision tokens before text, which can hurt alignment in streaming and limit real-time interaction in practice. In contrast, we interleave vision and text at 1 s steps to match real-time commentary and interaction, and we observe gains on both commentary and VQA. Long-Context and Streaming Inference in Text LLMs To handle near-infinite inputs under fixed memory and delay, the text community has proposed several lines of work: (1) Attention sink + slid- ing window: StreamingLLM keeps a small set of early \u201csink\u201d tokens plus a recent window, which stabilizes very long decoding (Xiao et al., 2024). (2) RoPE extension and continuity: YaRN, Lon- gRoPE, and LongLoRA for efficient fine-tuning improve position embedding extrapolation (Peng et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b); our contiguous RoPE follows this idea but tar- gets cross-modal, step-wise updates. (3) KV cache compression/eviction: H2O, SnapKV, and ReKV reduce KV size by selecting heavy hitters or gating heads (Zhang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024c; Di et al., 2025). However, these methods are mostly tested on text, and alignment between streaming training and inference remains underexplored. We bring the \u201csink + sliding window + contiguous position\u201d recipe to cross-modal streaming and introduce a training strategy for streaming inference. Streaming and Online Video LLMs Several concurrent works target streaming video directly. VideoLLM-online (LIVE) converts offline data into streaming dialogue for long context and low latency (Chen et al., 2024a). VideoStreaming uses a fixed video token budget to handle long videos (Qian et al., 2024). LiveCC", "strategy for streaming inference. Streaming and Online Video LLMs Several concurrent works target streaming video directly. VideoLLM-online (LIVE) converts offline data into streaming dialogue for long context and low latency (Chen et al., 2024a). VideoStreaming uses a fixed video token budget to handle long videos (Qian et al., 2024). LiveCC aligns large-scale ASR with video frames to push real-time sports commentary (Chen et al., 2025a). In practice, on videos longer than 5 minutes (at least 200 frames), these methods show clear performance drops, and their latency is still far from infinite real-time interaction. Compared with these, we (i) train with overlapped short chunks and full attention to match the sink + sliding window test pattern, and (ii) keep contiguous RoPE across modalities to enable real-time understanding over infinite videos. VLMs Benchmarks and Evaluation VideoMME covers 900 videos (254 hours) with multimodal inputs and tests both short and long time ranges (Fu et al., 2025). LiveSports-3K-CC compares real- time commentary quality and often uses the \u201cLLM-as-a-judge\u201d win-rate metric (Wang et al., 2025a). LVBench targets ultra-long videos and long-term memory (Wang et al., 2025a). However, Current benchmarks often focus on retrieval or summary over long videos and do not require frame-level un- derstanding, so even a very low FPS sample may pass. Our Inf-Streams-Eval is built for near-infinite commentary (over 2 hours). It requires second-level alignment between frames and responses and tests high-FPS, long-video understanding\u2014closer to real-world needs for VLM assistants, robots, and autonomous driving. 5 CONCLUSION In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a unified training\u2013inference framework that brings real- time streaming perception to existing VLMs. We first present an efficient strategy for training streaming VLMs and a data curation pipeline that together boost performance on both streaming tasks and VQA. We then show on real-world cases that our inference design enables real-time video understanding, delivering stable commentary for over 3 hours at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Finally, we release Inf-Streams, a new SFT dataset and benchmark that tests second-level, real-time understanding on videos averaging over 2 hours. Taken together, this work paves the way for practical deployment in real settings. 9 StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams REFERENCES Shuai Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, Sibo Song, Kai Dang, Peng Wang, Shijie Wang, Jun Tang, Humen Zhong, Yuanzhi Zhu, Mingkun Yang, Zhaohai Li, Jianqiang Wan, Pengfei Wang, Wei Ding, Zheren Fu, Yiheng Xu, Jiabo Ye, Xi Zhang, Tianbao Xie, Zesen Cheng, Hang Zhang, Zhibo Yang, Haiyang Xu, and Junyang Lin.

The LLMs were used exclusively as writing assistants to: \u2022 Polish and refine the language for clarity and conciseness \u2022 Improve grammar and sentence structure \u2022 Suggest alternative phrasings for technical descriptions \u2022 Help organize and structure sections for better flow All research ideas, experimental design, theoretical derivations, and scientific contributions are en- tirely our own. The LLMs did not contribute to research ideation, hypothesis formulation, or any core scientific aspects of this work. We used LLMs in a manner similar to grammar-checking tools, but with more sophisticated language capabilities. All content, including any LLM-assisted text, has been carefully reviewed and verified by the authors. We take full responsibility for all contents of this paper, including their accuracy and originality. A.2 STABILITY OVER TIME We split each video into five segments at 20% intervals and evaluate on the 2-hour test set. As shown in Figure 8, StreamingVLM does not degrade across later segments and reaches performance close to Sliding-Window w/ Overlap. This indicates that StreamingVLM maintains quality as videos grow and effectively supports unbounded inference.

Each test video is split into five segments at 20% intervals. Stream- ingVLM (Sliding Window + Reuse KV) maintains nearly constant win rate across segments and matches the performance of Sliding Window w/ Overlap, while Full Attention and Sliding Window w/o Overlap degrade or remain far lower. A.3 DEMO We provide a demo video in the supplementary materials showing StreamingVLM \u2019s commentary after 100 minutes of continuous inference. The video is randomly selected and edited to remove long pauses and mid-length ads. As the base model is modest in size, occasional hallucinations may occur. Please see the supplementary materials for details. 12"]
